<p>Product advertisers studied the effects of television ads on children’s choices for two new snacks. The advertisers used two 30-second television ads in an experiment. One ad was for a new sugary snack called Choco-Zuties, and the other ad was for a new healthy snack called Apple-Zuties.</p>
<p>For the experiment, 75 children were randomly assigned to one of three groups, A, B, or C. Each child individually watched a 30-minute television program that was interrupted for 5 minutes of advertising. The advertising was the same for each group with the following exceptions.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The advertising for group A included the Choco-Zuties ad but not the Apple-Zuties ad.</p></li>
<li><p>The advertising for group B included the Apple-Zuties ad but not the Choco-Zuties ad.</p></li>
<li><p>The advertising for group C included neither the Choco-Zuties ad nor the Apple-Zuties ad.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After the program, the children were offered a choice between the two snacks. The table below summarizes their choices.</p>

<p>As gasoline prices have increased in recent years, many drivers have expressed concern about the taxes they pay on gasoline for their cars. In the United States, gasoline taxes are imposed by both the federal government and by individual states. The boxplot above shows the distribution of the state gasoline taxes, in cents per gallon, for all 50 states on January 1, 2006.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">

<li><p>The federal tax imposed on gasoline was 18.4 cents per gallon at the time the state taxes were in effect. The federal gasoline tax was added to the state gasoline tax for each state to create a new distribution of combined gasoline taxes.

To play the game, students will attempt to launch Ping-Pong balls from the catapults so that the balls land within a 5-centimeter band.

<p>The department of agriculture at a university was interested in determining whether a preservative was effective in reducing discoloration in frozen strawberries. A sample of 50 ripe strawberries was prepared for freezing. Then the sample was randomly divided into two groups of 25 strawberries each. Each strawberry was placed into a small plastic bag.</p>
<p>The 25 bags in the control group were sealed. The preservative was added to the 25 bags containing strawberries in the treatment group, and then those bags were sealed.

<p>To determine the amount of sugar in a typical serving of breakfast cereal, a student randomly selected 60 boxes of different types of cereal from the shelves of a large grocery store.</p>
<p>The student noticed that the side panels of some of the cereal boxes showed sugar content based on one-cup servings, while others showed sugar content based on three-quarter-cup servings. Many of the cereal boxes with side panels that showed three-quarter-cup servings were ones that appealed to young children, and the student wondered whether there might be some difference in the sugar content of the cereals that showed different-size servings on their side panels. To investigate the question, the data were separated into two groups. One group consisted of 29 cereals that showed one-cup serving sizes; the other group consisted of 31 cereals that showed three-quarter-cup serving sizes. The boxplots shown below display sugar content (in grams) per serving of the cereals for each of the two serving sizes.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/data-transformations-01.png" class="align-center" src="../../../_images/data-transformations-01.png" />
<p>Two box plots are shown using the same horizontal axis, which shows sugar content per serving in grams and is labeled from 0 to 22 in increments of 2. The bottom plot is for three quarters of a cup. The box extends from 8 to 12 with a vertical line at 10 dividing it into two regions. A horizontal line off the left of the box extends to 4 and a horizontal line off the right extends to 14. The top plot is for one cup.

<p>After analyzing the boxplots on the preceding page, the student decided that instead of a comparison of sugar content per recommended serving, it might be more appropriate to compare sugar content for equal-size servings. To compare the amount of sugar in serving sizes of one cup each, the amount of sugar in each of the cereals showing three-quarter-cup servings on their side panels was multiplied by 4/3. The bottom boxplot shown below displays sugar content (in grams) per cup for those cereals that showed a serving size of three-quarter-cup on their side panels.</p>

<p>Agricultural experts are trying to develop a bird deterrent to reduce costly damage to crops in the United States. An experiment is to be conducted using garlic oil to study its effectiveness as a nontoxic, environmentally safe bird repellant. The experiment will use European starlings, a bird species that causes considerable damage annually to the corn crop in the United States. Food granules made from corn are to be infused with garlic oil in each of five concentrations of garlic: 0 percent, 2 percent, 10 percent, 25 percent, and 50 percent.</p>
<p>The researchers will determine the adverse reaction of the birds to the repellant by measuring the number of food granules consumed during a two-hour period following overnight food deprivation. There are forty birds available for the experiment, and the researchers will use eight birds for each concentration of garlic. Each bird will be kept in a separate cage and provided with the same number of food granules.</p>
