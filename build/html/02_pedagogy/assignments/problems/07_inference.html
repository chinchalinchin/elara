<p>When a tractor pulls a plow through an agricultural field, the energy needed to pull that plow is called the draft. The draft is affected by environmental conditions such as soil type, terrain, and moisture.</p>
<p>A study was conducted to determine whether a newly developed hitch would be able to reduce draft compared to the standard hitch. (A hitch is used to connect the plow to the tractor.) Two large plots of land were used in this study. It was randomly determined which plot was to be plowed using the standard hitch. As the tractor plowed that plot, a measurement device on the tractor automatically recorded the draft at 25 randomly selected points in the plot.</p>
<p>After the plot was plowed, the hitch was changed from the standard one to the new one, a process that takes a substantial amount of time. Then the second plot was plowed using the new hitch. Twenty-five measurements of draft were also recorded at randomly selected points in this plot.</p>

<p>As dogs age, diminished joint and hip health may lead to joint pain and thus reduce a dog’s activity level. Such a reduction in activity can lead to other health concerns such as weight gain and lethargy due to lack of exercise. A study is to be conducted to see which of two dietary supplements, glucosamine or chondroitin, is more effective in promoting joint and hip health and reducing the onset of canine osteoarthritis. Researchers will randomly select a total of 300 dogs from ten different large veterinary practices around the country. All of the dogs are more than 6 years old, and their owners have given consent to participate in the study. Changes in joint and hip health will be evaluated after 6 months of treatment.</p>

<p>A manufacturer of toxic pesticide granules plans to use a dye to color the pesticide so that birds will avoid eating it. A series of experiments will be designed to find colors or patterns that three bird species (blackbirds, starlings, and geese) will avoid eating. Representative samples of birds will be captured to use in the experiments, and the response variable will be the amount of time a hungry bird will avoid eating food of a particular color or pattern.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="loweralpha">
<li><p>Previous research has shown that male birds do not avoid solid colors. However, it is possible that males might avoid colors displayed in a pattern, such as stripes. In an effort to prevent males from eating the pesticide, the following two treatments are applied to the pesticide granules.</p>

<p>In response to nutrition concerns raised last year about food served in school cafeterias, the Smallville School District entered into a one-year contract with the Healthy Alternative Meals (HAM) company. Under this contract, the company plans and prepares meals for 2,500 elementary, middle, and high school students, with a focus on good nutrition. The school administration would like to survey the students in the district to estimate the proportion of students who are satisfied with the food under this contract.</p>
<p>Two sampling plans for selecting the students to be surveyed are under consideration by the administration. One plan is to take a simple random sample of students in the district and then survey those students. The other plan is to take a stratified random sample of students in the district and then survey those students.</p>

<p>A local school board plans to conduct a survey of parents’ opinions about year-round schooling in elementary schools. The school board obtains a list of all families in the district with at least one child in an elementary school and sends the survey to a random sample of 500 of the families. The survey question is provided below.</p>

<p>Many older homes have electrical systems that use fuses rather than circuit breakers. A manufacturer of 40-amp fuses wants to make sure that the mean amperage at which its fuses burn out is in fact 40. If the mean amperage is lower than 40, customers will complain because the fuses require replacement too often. If the mean amperage is higher than 40, the manufacturer might be liable for damage to an electrical system due to fuse malfunction. To verify the amperage of the fuses, a sample of fuses is to be selected and inspected.</p>

<p>For many years, the medically accepted practice of giving aid to a person experiencing a heart attack was to have the person who placed the emergency call administer chest compression (CC) plus standard mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (MMR) to the heart attack patient until the emergency response team arrived. However, some researchers believed that CC alone would be a more effective approach.</p>
<p>In the 1990s a study was conducted in Seattle in which 518 cases were randomly assigned to treatments: 278 to CC plus standard MMR and 240 to CC alone. A total of 64 patients survived the heart attack: 29 in the group receiving CC plus standard MMR, and 35 in the group receiving CC alone. A test of significance was conducted on the following hypotheses.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_0\)</span>: : The survival rates for the two treatments are equal.</p>

<p>A recent report stated that less than 35 percent of the adult residents in a certain city will be able to pass a physical fitness test. Consequently, the city’s Recreation Department is trying to convince the City Council to fund more physical fitness programs. The council is facing budget constraints and is skeptical of the report. The council will fund more physical fitness programs only if the Recreation Department can provide convincing evidence that the report is true.</p>
<p>The Recreation Department plans to collect data from a sample of 185 adult residents in the city. A test of significance will be conducted at a significance level of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span> for the following hypotheses.</p>

<p>Studies have shown that foods rich in compounds known as flavonoids help lower blood pressure. Researchers conducted a study to investigate whether there was a greater reduction in blood pressure for people who consumed dark chocolate, which contains flavonoids, than people who consumed white chocolate, which does not contain flavonoids. Twenty-five healthy adults agreed to participate in the study and add 3.5 ounces of chocolate to their daily diets. Of the 25 participants, 13 were randomly assigned to the dark chocolate group and the rest were assigned to the white chocolate group. All participants had their blood pressure recorded, in millimeters of mercury ( mmHg ), before adding chocolate to their daily diets and again 30 days after adding chocolate to their daily diets.</p>
<p>The reduction in blood pressure (before minus after) for each of the participants in the two groups is shown in the dotplots below.</p>

<p>A bottle-filling machine is set to dispense 12.1 fluid ounces into juice bottles. To ensure that the machine is filling accurately, every hour a worker randomly selects four bottles filled by the machine during the past hour and measures the contents. If there is convincing evidence that the mean amount of juice dispensed is different from 12.1 ounces or if there is convincing evidence that the standard deviation is greater than 0.05 ounce, the machine is shut down for recalibration. It can be assumed that the amount of juice that is dispensed into bottles is normally distributed.</p>
<p>During one hour, the mean number of fluid ounces of four randomly selected bottles was 12.05 and the standard deviation was 0.085 ounce.</p>

<p>High cholesterol levels in people can be reduced by exercise, diet, and medication. Twenty middle-aged males with cholesterol readings between 220 and 240 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) of blood were randomly selected from the population of such male patients at a large local hospital. Ten of the 20 males were randomly assigned to group A, advised on appropriate exercise and diet, and also received a placebo. The other 10 males were assigned to group B, received the same advice on appropriate exercise and diet, but received a drug intended to reduce cholesterol instead of a placebo. After three months, posttreatment cholesterol readings were taken for all 20 males and compared to pretreatment cholesterol readings.

<p>A serum cholesterol level above 250 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) of blood is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in humans. At a medical center in St. Louis, a study to test the effectiveness of a new cholesterol-lowering drug was conducted. One hundred people with cholesterol levels between 250 mg/dl and 300 mg/dl were available for this study. Fifty people were assigned at random to each of two treatment groups. One group received the standard cholesterol-lowering medication and the other group received the new drug. After taking the drug for three weeks, the 50 subjects who received the standard treatment had a mean decrease in cholesterol level of 10 mg/dl with a standard deviation of 8 mg/dl, and the 50 subjects who received the new drug had a mean decrease of 18 mg/dl with a standard deviation of 12 mg/dl.</p>
