<p>There are two mutually exclusive categories of <a class="reference internal" href="../03_theurgy/02_palindromia/05_palindromes.html#definition-4-1-1"><span class="std std-ref">palindromes</span></a> in any <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>: perfect and imperfect.</p>
<p>A <a class="reference internal" href="../03_theurgy/02_palindromia/05_palindromes.html#definition-4-1-2"><span class="std std-ref">perfect palindrome</span></a> is symmetric, by which it is meant a <a class="reference internal" href="../03_theurgy/02_palindromia/05_palindromes.html#definition-4-1-2"><span class="std std-ref">perfect palindrome</span></a> may be reversed character-wise. Of the “species” of <a class="reference internal" href="../03_theurgy/02_palindromia/05_palindromes.html#definition-4-1-1"><span class="std std-ref">palindromes</span></a> in any given <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>, they are the most rare, because their grammatical conditions are so stringent (at least as far as English is concerned). Counter-intuitively, this makes them the easiest to construct.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../03_theurgy/02_palindromia/05_palindromes.html#definition-4-1-2"><span class="std std-ref">Perfect palindromes</span></a> mostly hinge on <a class="reference internal" href="../03_theurgy/02_palindromia/02_language.html#invertible-words"><span class="std std-ref">invertible</span></a> grammatical structures embodied in the “<em>on-no</em>”, “<em>now-won</em>” and “<em>saw-was</em>” invertible pairs. Without these invertible pivot points, a <a class="reference internal" href="../03_theurgy/02_palindromia/05_palindromes.html#definition-4-1-2"><span class="std std-ref">perfect palindromes</span></a> must rely on the symmetry of a central <a class="reference internal" href="../03_theurgy/02_palindromia/02_language.html#reflective-words"><span class="std std-ref">palindromic word</span></a>.

<ul class="simple">

</ul>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../03_theurgy/02_palindromia/05_palindromes.html#definition-4-1-3"><span class="std std-ref">Imperfect palindromes</span></a>, by contrast, degrade under reversal. Consider cases like “<em>borrow or rob</em>” or “<em>name now one man</em>” which, while palindromic, do not preserve semantic content when reversed. However, by dropping the delimiting character, namely the space “ “, the palindromicity can be reconstructed in a degenerate alphabet, e.g. “<em>borroworob</em>” and “<em>namenowoneman</em>” are palindromic strings in an alphabet with no delimiting characters.</p>
<p>These observations suggest an algebraic structure exists embedded within linguistics. Let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta\)</span> be a sentence, defined as a sequence of characters. Then, define the <a class="reference internal" href="../03_theurgy/02_palindromia/02_language.html#string-inversion"><span class="std std-ref">inverse</span></a> of a sentence, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\text{inv}(\zeta)\)</span>, as the reversal of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta\)</span>’s characters. Furthermore, define the <a class="reference internal" href="../03_theurgy/02_palindromia/04_structures.html#definition-3-1-2"><span class="std std-ref">reduction</span></a> of a sentence, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varsigma(\zeta)\)</span>, as the string which results from the removal of delimiter characters from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta\)</span>. Then, palindromes, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta_p\)</span> can be defined mathematically as the sentences whose reduced forms are equal to their own inverses,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\varsigma(\zeta_p) = \text{inv}(\varsigma(\zeta_p))\]</div>
<p>It can be shown that inversion and reduction, which are string operations, commute over strings, so the above equation can be extended,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\varsigma(\zeta_p) = \varsigma(\text{inv}(\zeta_p)) = \text{inv}(\varsigma(\zeta_p))\]</div>
<p>In other words, palindromes, perfect and imperfect, are exactly the class of sentences which satsify this formal constraint.</p>

<p>What is <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>? Did it emerge gradually or all at once? Was there a point in time when no <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> existed and the next it did?</p>
<p>Does the distinction between <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">meta-language</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">object language</span></a> exist in actuality? Is there a <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> <em>about</em> <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>, where the general conditions for <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> can be precisely specified? What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>? Can <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> be described in aggregate?</p>
<p>The nature of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> is elusive. It begs an unending series of questions and offers little in the way of answers. It resists definition, for definitions occur within it. It resists analysis, for analysis occurs within it. <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">Language</span></a> is a vicuous circle. <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">Language</span></a> is <em>the</em> vicuous circle, from which all others originate. Language is inescapable and intractable. One might attempt to formalize <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>, but every attempt hitherto has failed. There are always aspects of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> that exceed any container we construct for it. Indeed, there appear to be certain syntactical constraints that can be placed on the general science of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">Language</span></a> is a hierarchy of ordered sequences. Words are ordered sequences of characters. Sentences are ordered sequences of words.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This seems fundamental. If there is a purely logical and formal principle underlying <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>, surely this is it.  Almost every known <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> conforms to this model, in some way. However, even with this meager claim, the most miniscule of structural propositions (that structure <em>exists</em>), counter-examples can be produced that show this <a class="reference internal" href="../03_theurgy/02_palindromia/03_corpora.html#section-ii-ii"><span class="std std-ref">axiom</span></a> fails to span the entire breadth of the phenomenon of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>.</p>
<p>To start, the concept of declension immediately challenges this hierarchical model of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>. In <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">languages</span></a> like Greek or Latin, the suffixes appended to words denote its part of speech. Consider the three Latin sentences,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Puella canem videt. (Girl dog sees)</p></li>
<li><p>Canem puella videt. (Dog girl sees)</p></li>
<li><p>Videt puella canem. (Sees girl dog)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each sentence, in essence, expresses the same proposition, showing that sentences are not necessarily constrained to be ordered sequences of words. The order of the declined words is not <em>meaningless</em> in this example, as order in declined <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> often denotes emphasis, but importantly, it is not the <em>primary</em> bearer of meaning. However, the spirit of the model can be recovered by adjusting structure of hierarchy, perhaps by adding a layer above sentence for “<em>tokens</em>”, of which each of the previous sentences is an instance.</p>
<p>However, there is a more fundamental challenge to the hierarchical model of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>. Similar to declension, agglutinative <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">languages</span></a> accumulate meaning through suffixes applied to roots. The boundary between <em>sentences</em> and <em>words</em> is not well-defined in an agglutinative <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">languages</span></a>.</p>
<p>In the Native America <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> of Central Alaskan Yup’ik,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>tuntussuqatarniksaitengqiggtuq</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Translates roughly to “<em>He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer.</em>” Describing this linguistic entity as a “<em>word</em>” does not fully elucidate its role in Yup’ik <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>; it would be more accurately classified as a sentence, but that also is not entirely true. The “<em>words</em>” of the “<em>sentence</em>” are not delimited by blank characters or other marks, so that it appears to an Indo-European speaker to be a single word. This “<em>sentence-word</em>” is formed by stacking morphemes into a single word,</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tuntu-</span></code>: reindeer</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-ssur-</span></code>: to hunt</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-qatar-</span></code>: will be going</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-ni-</span></code>: to say that</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-ksaite-</span></code> : not yet</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-ngqiggte-</span></code> : again</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-uq</span></code>: third person indicative mood</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>This is a very approximate mapping to English. Take it with a grain of salt.</p>
</div>
<p>As another example of an agglutinative phrase, consider the Turkish,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>evlerimde</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The root <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ev</span></code>, <em>house</em>, is modified by a plural suffix <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ler</span></code>, a possessive suffix <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">im</span></code> and then a prepositional suffix <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">de</span></code>, so that it translates into English as “<em>in my houses</em>”. This <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> formation process may be visualized as a type of functional composition. A root has a grammatical operation applied to it,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\text{plural}(x) = x + \text{ler}\]</div>
<p>Where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> is the root and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(+\)</span> represents concatenation. Similariy, the operators for possession and preposition can represented,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}\text{possessive}(x) = x + \text{im}\\\text{preposition}(x) = x + \text{de}\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>Then, the word <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">evlerimde</span></code> can be represented formally as,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\text{preposition}(\text{possessive}(\text{plural}(x)))\]</div>
<p>In other words, a “<em>word</em>” in an agglutinative <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> is a sequence of operations applied to a root, where the operations <em>are</em> the grammatical structure of the <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>.</p>
<p>The essential nature of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> appears to be sequential, but identifying <em>what</em> is being sequenced presents a problem. We want to name the terms of linguistic science, but there seems to be no universal property that is manifested in every instance of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>.</p>
<p>To reconcile these two distinct categories of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> (called <em>synthetic</em> and <em>analytic</em>), linguistics often treats <em>morphemes</em> as the smallest semantic unit (the smallest token in a sentence that bears meaning), from which larger complexes are constructed.</p>
<p>However, there is a subtle problem in this model, which is not necessarily a flaw, but does commit its proponents to an ontological position they might not be willing to adopt were it made explicit.</p>
<p>The morpheme model of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> that unifies analytic and synthetic <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">languages</span></a> requires viewing the referents of signs (symbols, abstractions) indirectly. In other words, a sign from this model does not directly signify the signified, but does so through modalities that alter its apparent form. To state more clearly, this <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> model supposes a universal term preexists the particular instance of it within the sentence and moreover, it supposes the essential process of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> is to instantiates these universals into particular words or sentences.</p>
<p>Moreover, this abstraction requires syntactic artifices like <em>null morphemes</em> to describe how morphological operators behave when applied to certain lexical roots,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}\text{plural}(\text{horse}) = \text{horse} + \text{s}\\\text{plural}(\text{deer}) = \text{deer} + \varnothing\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>However, this representation is slightly misleading in its form. A more accurate formal model would distinguish the tokens “deer” and “horse” (i.e. the <em>names</em> of their conceptual locus) from their written representation. Letting <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathfrak{x}\)</span> stand for the token, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> for its written representation and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span> for the morphological operator,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}f(\mathfrak{x}) = x + s\\f(\mathfrak{y}) = y + \varnothing\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>The important point in this formalization is that the token and the representation exist in different domains; one is mapped to the other.</p>
<p>In other words, this model seems to assert that when a speaker utters “<em>the cat is here</em>”, the speaker is necessarily comprehending the word “<em>cat</em>” indirectly as the result of applying a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\text{singular}()\)</span> operator to an underlying <em>essence</em>. Linguistics, it seems, has an implicit stance on the Aristotelian problem of the Universal, namely that universals exist, insofar as language is concerned.</p>

<p>A universal motif of creation myths is the prominence of <em>speaking</em> and <em>naming</em>. Almost every myth that attempts to elucidate the origins of existence describes a process where the very act of speech induces creation. The world is portrayed as <em>formless</em> and <em>void</em>, a sea of primordial <em>chaos</em>; it is <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> itself that give structure to the penumbral shadow, pulling it into light and casting it into <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#being"><span class="std std-ref">beings</span></a>. The ubiquity of this theme across different historical eras and disparate geographic areas suggests it is not merely random or circumstantial, but indicative of the fundamental pathology that language induces in the human mind.</p>
<p>Any assertions about the origin and historical development of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> must remain speculation, but nonetheless, certain patterns emerge from the available evidence. The earliest records of written <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>, such as Ancient Egyptian or Sumerian, are pictographic in nature, meaning there tends to be a direct correspondence between the symbol and the object it represents, e.g. a sun is represented by a starburst or a fish by the crisscrossed curves that form its shape. The grammar of a purely pictographic <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> is primarily extensional, meaning it does not have the syntactic glue to bind its presented concepts into complex relations except through their mere presentation. A pictogram of an axe juxtaposed with a pictogram of tree implies a certain action, but it does not contain complex modalities like motive, temporality or setting. Its possible interpretations are limited to simple utterances, “* tree cut down*” or “<em>man cuts tree</em>”; there are no syntactic markers upon which to hang the semantics of <em>why</em>, <em>how</em>, <em>when</em> or <em>if</em>.</p>
<p>As <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> evolves, its progression into abstraction is apparaent. The correspondence between the signifier and the signified is almost entirely severed as linguistic forms accumulate syntactic functions and these functions become the bearers of meaning beyond the directly indicative; Language is no longer a direct mapping between object and sign. The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/writing/Sumerian-writing">following diagram</a> shows the evolution of cunieform, from simple pictograms to abstract symbols,</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/cuneiform-evolution.jpg"><img alt="Encyclopedia Britannica Cuneiform Table" class="align-center" src="../_images/cuneiform-evolution.jpg" style="width: 80%;" />
</a>
<p>The lefthand column pictograms are clearly direct representations of the underlying concept, a visual analogue of reality. The grammar of such a system cannot help being analogical by mimicking the perceived the relations of reality through their direct image in writing. There is no other way to represent relations except spatially, i.e. by placing the symbol for “<em>foot</em>” next to the symbol for “<em>road</em>” to indicate the action of “<em>walking</em>”. Actions, and the complex relations which factor into motive forms, are reduced to the aggregation of their constituent objects.</p>
<p>This type of representation offers little in the way of symbolically presenting the internal state of a human. There is no way to conceive of “<em>self</em>” in a pictographic system, because a “<em>self</em>” cannot be represented graphically. In other words, the “<em>self</em>” never sees itself because it is the thing that <em>sees</em>. The conceptualization of “<em>self</em>” requires semantic features this form of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> does not possess.</p>
<aside class="topic">
<p class="topic-title">Conjecture</p>
<p>Early creation myths are records of the transformation every <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> must undergo to provide the linguistic apparatus for progressing from purely visual and analogical to the abstract and metaphorical. Creation myths are literal linguistic artifacts of early humans attempting (or inventing the terms) to describe the transformation they were undergoing, from a form of consciousness primarily grounded in immediate perception and external representation to a form of highly symbolic abstraction that allows (or induces) a conceptualization of “<em>self</em>”.</p>
</aside>
<p>The sheer breadth of history that separates the current time period from the moment when creation myths were actually written precludes any positive verification of this claim, so all evidence will necessarily be circumstantial. Bearing that in mind, a particularly compelling piece of evidence for this claim is demonstrated in <em>Exodus 3:14</em>, when Moses asks for the name of God to give to his people. God replies,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה</p>
<p>Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This phrase presents significant challenges when translated into modern English. It is often rendered as one of the following,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I am who I am</p>
<p>I am that I am</p>
<p>I will be what I will be</p>
<p>I am the being</p>
<p>I am the one who is</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>These translations are influenced and constrainted by the historical trajectory of the Torah through Greek and Latin cultures. When translated into the Greek Septuagint, the original Hebrew phrase became,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ὤν</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The Greek Septuagint introduced a definite article in the form of “<em>ὁ</em>” and a personal first person in “<em>Ἐγώ</em>” in order to reconstruct the perceived meaning of Ancient Hebrew within Koine Greek. More fundamental, it translated “<em>אֶהְיֶה (ehyeh)</em>” into the present tense of “<em>εἰμι (eimi)</em>”. The effects have been passed down to present day translations like King James. However, the original meaning of the “<em>Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh</em>” is not entirely captured by any of these translations.</p>
<p>Ancient Hebrew did not have a modality for time. Its verbs were given aspects, but not temporality. A Hebrew verb has a <em>perfect</em> aspect and an <em>imperfect</em> aspect. The <em>perfect</em> aspect denotes completed or singular actions. This is sometimes called the <em>gnomic</em> mode or tense. In English, some examples are given in the following,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It has been decided.</p></li>
<li><p>The sun rises.</p></li>
<li><p>The birds are fast.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, these statements, while exhibiting <em>perfect</em> aspect, by their instantiation in English, are necessarily inflected with temporality, e.g. “<em>rises</em>” or “<em>has been</em>”. Again, it is crucial to note Ancient Hebrew did not have this modality.</p>
<p>The <em>imperfect</em> aspect denotes an incomplete, ongoing or potential action. In English, some examples are given,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>They will go.</p></li>
<li><p>The bird sings every morning.</p></li>
<li><p>The store used to be open.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>“<em>אֶהְיֶה (ehyeh)</em>” is the first person singular imperfect form of “<em>הָיָה (hayah)</em>”, which translate into “<em>to be</em>”, “<em>to become</em>”, “<em>to exist</em>”. “<em>אֶהְיֶה (ehyeh)</em>” is the Ancient Hebrew concept of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#being"><span class="std std-ref">being</span></a>.</p>
<p>“<em>אֲשֶׁר (asher)</em>” is a linguistic relativizer, analogous to the English “<em>that</em>” or “<em>which</em>”. A relativizer plays a role not dissimilar to the role of quantification in symbolic logic, in that it provides conditions for its clause to obtain, i.e.,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the lady from Chicago that sang a tune.</p></li>
<li><p>the brown dog which ran away.</p></li>
<li><p>the man that wasn’t there.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These examples show the function of a relativizer is to qualify its clauses. With these facts in mind, the literal English translation of “<em>אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה</em>” is,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>am that am</p>
<p>am which am</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The question then becomes in what <em>mode</em> to interpret the “<em>am</em>”, i.e. as a potentiality, a habituality or ongoing process. Regardless, taken in conjunction with the previous conjecture, God’s reply to Moses appears to identify divinity itself with the conjugation of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#being"><span class="std std-ref">being</span></a> into its <em>imperfect first person modality</em> of “<em>am</em>”. Moreover, that <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#being"><span class="std std-ref">being</span></a> is qualified relative to itself.</p>
<aside class="topic">
<p class="topic-title">Conjecture</p>
<p>Early humans did not have the concept of “<em>self</em>” until <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> had evolved to the point where abstraction, complex predication and metaphor was possible.</p>
</aside>
<p>It is easy to be fooled by the apparent continuity of our “<em>self</em>” through time and space that consciousness is a single thing, everywhere equivalent in its multiplicity. We assume our consciousness is in every way identical to every other, except for its particular circumstances, that we might substitute our “<em>self</em>” into another’s without alteration. That no one remembers their birth or early youth except in fragments is dismissed because however blurry the memory, we remember our self “<a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#being"><span class="std std-ref">being there</span></a>”. We don’t account for the role that <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> plays in the development of our “<em>self</em>”. Humans are essentially vessels for <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>. Our earliest records are (<em>allegedly</em>) suffused with the history of consciousness itself.</p>
<p>If the conjecture is granted, the question remains: what is the “<em>self</em>”? How does the modality of “<em>am</em>” that evolved from the concept of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#being"><span class="std std-ref">Being</span></a> allow the “<em>self</em>” to take root? Is the “<em>self</em>” created or described by this evolution of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>? Conceding to the ever present specter of uncerainty, the question is essentially: does <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> <em>induce</em> self-awareness or does it provide the formal framework for its interpretation?</p>

<h3>Contradiction: A History of Propositions<a class="headerlink" href="#contradiction-a-history-of-propositions" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>It is instructive to consider the history of the <em>proposition</em>, for the <em>proposition</em> is at once a sentence and a unit of mathematics, i.e. a <a class="reference internal" href="../02_pedagogy/foundations/01_logic.html#truth-values"><span class="std std-ref">truth value</span></a>. The proposition is a both a <em>meaningful</em> thing and a <em>formal</em> thing. The history of philosophy and mathematics is, by and large, an analysis and gradual unveiling of the relations that bind <em>form</em> to <em>meaning</em>, <em>syntax</em> to <em>semantics</em>. It is therefore, fundamentally, a history of contradiction and paradox.</p>
<aside class="sidebar">
<p>Heidegger would call this translation <em>latinized</em>, and point out the components underlying the meaning of <em>οὐσία</em>. <em>οὐσία</em> is derived from the feminine present participle of <em>εἶναι</em> (<em>to be</em>), <em>οὖσα</em>, but it is also etymologically related to <em>παρουσία</em> (<em>being-at, present</em>).

<p>Aristotle regarded a <a class="reference internal" href="../02_pedagogy/foundations/01_logic.html#proposition"><span class="std std-ref">proposition</span></a> as a representation of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#being"><span class="std std-ref">being</span></a>, and thought of the syntax of <a class="reference internal" href="../02_pedagogy/foundations/01_logic.html#proposition"><span class="std std-ref">propositions</span></a> as manifestations of the different <em>categories</em> of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#being"><span class="std std-ref">being</span></a>. Aristotle’s ontology regarded <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#being"><span class="std std-ref">being</span></a> as a relationship of predication that ultimately resolved to a category predicated of the primitive subject, termed the “<em>οὐσία</em>” (often translated as <em>substance</em>). Aristotle defined the nature of the predicative relations in <a class="reference external" href="https://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/categories.1.1.html">Categories</a>, summarized below,</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Substance (<em>οὐσία</em>): What something fundamentally is.</p></li>
<li><p>Quantity (<em>ποσόν</em>): How much or how many of the subtance exists.</p></li>
<li><p>Quality (<em>ποιόν</em>): What kind or sort of thing a substance is.</p></li>
<li><p>Relation (<em>πρός τι</em>): How a substance stands in reference to another substance.</p></li>
<li><p>Place (<em>ποῦ</em>): Where the substance is located.</p></li>
<li><p>Time (<em>πότε</em>): When the substance exists.</p></li>
<li><p>Position (<em>κεῖσθαι</em>): The physical arrangement of the substance’s parts.</p></li>
<li><p>State (<em>ἔχειν</em>): The condition or state of having something.</p></li>
<li><p>Action (<em>ποιεῖν</em>): What the substance is actively doing.</p></li>
<li><p>Passion (<em>πάσχειν</em>): What is being done to the substance.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Aristotle viewed the predication of a category as applying to either the entire <em>οὐσία</em>, a part of the <em>οὐσία</em> or none of the <em>οὐσία</em>. Modern <a class="reference internal" href="../02_pedagogy/foundations/01_logic.html#logic"><span class="std std-ref">logic</span></a> tends to view this as the equivalent of <a class="reference internal" href="../02_pedagogy/foundations/01_logic.html#logical-quantification"><span class="std std-ref">quantification</span></a>, but as Peter Abelard pointed out (see below) this type <em>Aristotelian</em> <a class="reference internal" href="../02_pedagogy/foundations/01_logic.html#logical-quantification"><span class="std std-ref">quantification</span></a> has important differences that are not present in its modern descendant. These differences are themselves rooted in the <em>lack</em> of material difference in the ancient concepts of <a class="reference internal" href="../02_pedagogy/foundations/01_logic.html#logic"><span class="std std-ref">logic</span></a> and ontology; when Aristotle is expounding his <a class="reference internal" href="../02_pedagogy/foundations/01_logic.html#logic"><span class="std std-ref">logic</span></a> in <a class="reference external" href="https://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/prior.1.i.htm">Prior Analytics</a>, he is not making formal (<em>syntactic</em>, <a class="reference internal" href="../02_pedagogy/foundations/01_logic.html#tautologies"><span class="std std-ref">tautological</span></a>) arguments, he is making ontological (<em>semantic</em>, <em>interpretative</em>) arguments. This becomes clear when he “<em>proves</em>” his syllogistic figures by appeal to ordered triplets of <em>things</em>. (TODO: example here)</p>
<p>The division of <a class="reference internal" href="../02_pedagogy/foundations/01_logic.html#logic"><span class="std std-ref">logic</span></a> and ontology into separate domains of discourse did not occur until much later, its beginnings emerging approximately in parallel with the Renaisannce era, when figures like Boole began to probe and map the formal properties of <a class="reference internal" href="../02_pedagogy/foundations/01_logic.html#logic"><span class="std std-ref">logic</span></a>, eventually leading to successive revolutions of Frege, Russell, Gödel and Tarski, which effectively isolated <a class="reference internal" href="../02_pedagogy/foundations/01_logic.html#logic"><span class="std std-ref">logic</span></a> from ontology by reducing the subject’s presence in the ancient science to the role of interpretation.</p>
<aside class="sidebar">
<p>Badiou’s pronouncement, <a class="reference external" href="BeingandEvent">mathematics is ontology</a> is an attempt to return ontology to formal discourse. However, as this essay will argue, his pronouncement is <em>essentially</em> incorrect. Mathematics is <em>metaphysics</em>, or atleast as close as a subject can get without thereby becoming it.</p>
</aside>
<p>In the modern conception of <a class="reference internal" href="../02_pedagogy/foundations/01_logic.html#logic"><span class="std std-ref">logic</span></a>, the subject’s role lies in finding a real world model that <em>satifies</em> the syntactical properties of the formal model under the assignment (indexing) of empirical objects to the symbolic terms of the <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>. The formal model has no responsibility to comport itself towards <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#being"><span class="std std-ref">being</span></a> real; the one interpretting the model must find its coherent interpretation in reality. A significant portion of modern mathematics is nothing more than the production of formal theorems unanchored by empirical reality, often justified by appeal to other instances of theoretical constructs finding unintended interpretations, e.g. the axioms of probability in geometric proportions, imaginary numbers in engineering applications, etc. The <em>intension</em> of <a class="reference internal" href="../02_pedagogy/foundations/01_logic.html#aristotelian-logic"><span class="std std-ref">Aristotelian logic</span></a>, however, is to explicitly elaborate the structure of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#being"><span class="std std-ref">being</span></a>, first and foremost.</p>
<p>However, within the <a class="reference internal" href="../02_pedagogy/foundations/01_logic.html#logic"><span class="std std-ref">logic</span></a> of Aristotle, there is a subtle flaw which betokens why <a class="reference internal" href="../02_pedagogy/foundations/01_logic.html#logic"><span class="std std-ref">logic</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> must remain incapable of an equivalency with <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#being"><span class="std std-ref">being</span></a>. In <a class="reference external" href="https://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/prior.1.i.htm">Prior Analytics</a>, Aristotle often uses what he termed a “<em>positive conversion</em>” from a universally affirmed premise to particular premise,</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">

<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[AaB, BaC \vdash AaC\]</div>
<p>Which is rendered into English as,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If all B are A and all C are B, then all C are A.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C\)</span> represent <em>genera</em> and <em>species</em> of <em>οὐσία</em>, for example, <em>animal</em>, <em>man</em> and <em>husband</em>. Aristotle often proves these “<em>figures</em>” of deduction by applying a positive universal conversion, as in his proof of the <em>Darapti</em> deduction,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[PaS, RaS \vdash PiS\]</div>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<div><p>When both P and R belong to every S, it results of necessity that P will belong to some R. For since the positive premise converts, S will belong to some R; consequently, since P belongs to every S and S to some R, it is necessary for P to belong to some R (for a deduction through the first figure comes about).</p>

<p>The deduction rule <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(AaB \to AiB\)</span> is often termed a deduction of <em>existential import</em>, for it implicitly assumes the existence of its premise. Abelard brought this subtle fallacy to light in his <em>Dialectica</em>,</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<div><p>If ‘<em>every stone-man is a stone</em>’ is true, also its conversion per accidens is true (’<em>some stones are stone-men</em>’). But no stone is a stone-man, because neither this man nor that man etc. is a stone. But also this ‘<em>a certain stone-man is not a stone</em>’ is false by necessity, since it is impossible to suppose it is true.</p>
<p class="attribution">—Dialectica, Abelard</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>What Abelard is pointing out is a notion that would not be formalized for another millenia in the strictures of set theory: unrestricted comprehension of an abstraction principle necessarily leads to contradiction. The proposition, “<em>all stone men are stone</em>”, can be true, syntactically speaking, when no objects exist in the domain that is being quantified, namely “<em>stone men</em>”. As a consequence, because “<em>all stone men are stone</em>” can be true without referring to any actual <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#being"><span class="std std-ref">beings</span></a>, it is too much to grant a deduction from the universal assertion to a particular instance of a “<em>stone man</em>”. In other words, “<em>all</em>” does not imply “<em>some</em>” if nothing exists to satisfy “<em>all</em>”; indeed, “<em>all</em>” must be conditioned on a presupposed existent <em>thing</em>.</p>
<p>The essential fallacy committed by Aristotle is supposing <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> can represent reality with perfect fidelity. The crux of Abelard’s criticism is found in how Aristotle transforms an argument into symbolic abstractions, manipulates the abstractions through an algebra and then transforms the result back into the original <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> to obtain the conclusion. Aristotle supposes one can assign symbols to things and then map the actual relations that obtain between the things onto the syntactic rules that connect the symbols. Once this assignment is made, he supposes the result obtained through symbolic deduction is equivalent to the actual conclusion, where each application of a rule (e.g. a conversion) in the deductive chain corresponds to some actual thought process that would occur were it (the thought process) to consider the argument on its own terms.</p>
<p>At this point, one might assume, as humans did, it is merely a lack of precision that prevents Aristotle’s ontology from expressing the true relations of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#being"><span class="std std-ref">being</span></a>. However, the inability of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> to penetrate <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#being"><span class="std std-ref">being</span></a> is the perennial problem of philosophy. Again and again, age after age, it is supposed the nature of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#being"><span class="std std-ref">being</span></a> can be reduced to words. The history of logic and the proposition is the history of a losing war. Each time, armies are raised, cloaked in ever more complex machinery. The battles become more sophiscated and harder to follow, but the outcome is always the same. The human mind falters in its approach and discovers another layer of contradiction encircling its thoughts.</p>
<p>In the late nineteenth century, the most sustained and protracted campaigns of this war, up to that point in history, was waged by Frege’s <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_LZ5tAAAAMAAJ/mode/2up">Grundgesetze Der Arithmetik</a> . In this sprawling and dense work, Frege target was the language of arithmetic, which contains such statement as “<em>all numbers have a successor</em>” or symbollically in modern notation,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[a \in \mathbb{N} \implies a + 1 \in \mathbb{N}\]</div>
<p>His goal was to show this <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> was derived from the more fundamental <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> of <a class="reference internal" href="../02_pedagogy/foundations/01_logic.html#logic"><span class="std std-ref">logic</span></a> through definition and deduction. In effect, Frege sought to show, using precise <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> lacking any ambiguity, the essential nature of numbers was logical.</p>
<p>To see how the conundrum of existence and <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> ruptures Frege’s <a class="reference internal" href="../02_pedagogy/foundations/01_logic.html#logic"><span class="std std-ref">logic</span></a> from the inside out, one must understand how
Frege departed from the Aristotelian model of <a class="reference internal" href="../02_pedagogy/foundations/01_logic.html#logic"><span class="std std-ref">logic</span></a>. Frege conceived of a proposition <em>extensionally</em>, as opposed to <em>categorically</em>. To Frege, a proposition is a formula that is <em>satisfied</em> by certain objects. For example, “<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> <em>is even</em>” is a proposition <em>satisfied</em> by the series of numbers <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0, 2, 4, ...\)</span>; Frege thought of each proposition as implicitly expressing the relation of “<em>belonging</em>” between an object <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> and a (<em>value-range or extension of a</em>) concept <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\epsilon}f\)</span>, where the relation is manifested through a property predicated of each object that belongs to the concept. In other words, Frege saw <em>predication</em> as being equivalent to <em>abstraction</em>.</p>
<p>For example, to say in Fregean terms, “<em>this pen belongs to the concept of Black</em>” is equivalent to saying “<em>this pen is a black object</em>”. Note in these examples the division between the near-Platonic formal nature of “<em>Black</em>” and the near-Aristotelian predication of “<em>black</em>”. The use of capitalization is intentional, for Frege would call “<em>Black</em>” a proper name and “<em>black</em>” a description. According to Frege, <em>Black</em> is the abstract concept common to all instances of <em>black</em> things. In other words, Frege has committed himself to a stance on the problem of universals, namely that they exist.</p>
<p>Moreover, Fregean concepts exist as <em>terms</em> in the language from which they arose as abstractions. Frege asserted, for all objects <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>, the property <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span> being equal to the property <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g\)</span> is equivalent to saying the concept <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\epsilon}f\)</span> and the concept <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\epsilon}g\)</span> are the same concept,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[(\forall x: f(x) \equiv g(x)) \equiv (\hat{\epsilon}f = \hat{\epsilon}g)\]</div>
<p>The righthand side of this equivalency treats the concepts  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\epsilon}f\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\epsilon}g\)</span> as operands in an equality relation, which to say, it treats concepts <em>as objects in the language of</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_LZ5tAAAAMAAJ/mode/2up">Grundgesetze der Arithmetik</a>. This <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/06_axiomata.html#frege-axioms"><span class="std std-ref">axiom</span></a> was called <em>Law V</em> by Frege.</p>
<p>Note this formulation is symmetrical and complementary with the logical law, first posited by Leibniz and adopted by Frege in his <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_LZ5tAAAAMAAJ/mode/2up">Grundgesetze Der Arithmetik</a>, that if two objects have the same properties, they are identical (often known as the Law of Indiscernibles),</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\forall a, b: (\forall f: f(a) \equiv f(b)) \equiv (a = b)\]</div>
<p>However, instead of quantifying over objects and passing into conceptuality, the Law of Indiscernibles passes into objectivity by quantifying over properties (i.e. abstractions). In other words, the Law of Indiscernible states for all possible properties that can be asserted of two objects, if and only if the objects are the same will all of the asserted properties of those objects be equivalent <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#may-2025-02" id="id10" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>. On the other hand, Frege’s Law V states, for <em>all objects</em>, if and only if the (<em>extensions of</em>) concepts are the same will the asserted properties to those concepts be equivalent.</p>
<p>The Law of Indiscernibles qualifies abstractions in their totality and passes into an assertion of equality between the objects which originate the abstraction, whereas Frege’s Law V qualifies objects in their totality and then passes into an assertion of equality between their abstractions. Crucially, the Law of Indiscernibles can be <em>vacuously true</em>, as in the case of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span> representing such properties as the predicate of “<em>being impredicable</em>”. However, the quantification in Frege’s Law V is <em>existentially</em> important for all but the <em>null</em> domain; Frege’s Law V <em>assumes the existence of the object being quantified</em>.</p>
<p>To draw to the surface the lurking shadow of Abelard’s stone men from Frege’s Law V, and reveal the formal structure of contradiction in Frege’s <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_LZ5tAAAAMAAJ/mode/2up">Grundgesetze Der Arithmetik</a>, the notion of “<em>an object</em> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> <em>belonging to a concept</em> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\epsilon}\)</span>” must be defined <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#may-2025-03" id="id11" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>3<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[x \frown \hat{\epsilon}f \equiv \exists \phi: (\hat{\epsilon}f = \hat{\epsilon}\phi) \land \phi(x)\]</div>
<p>That is, asserting <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> <em>belongs</em> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\epsilon}f\)</span> is equivalent to asserting there exists a property <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\)</span> of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> (denoted <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi(x)\)</span>) <em>and</em> the concept (value-range) of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\)</span> is equal to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\epsilon}f\)</span> (the concept or value range of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span>). <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#may-2025-04" id="id12" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>4<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> It is rightly stated by Frege’s commentators that Law V leads directly to the contradiction of Russell’s Paradox. This is true, but the manner in which this contradiction arises is often not appreciated. The origin of Russell’s Paradox in Frege’s system is the existential and creative nature of his definition of membership, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frown\)</span>. From this definition, Law V is used to show,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[x \frown \hat{\epsilon}f \equiv f(x)\]</div>
<p>Which is to say, the assertion of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> belonging to a concept <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\epsilon}f\)</span> is equivalent to the assertion <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> has property <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span>. From here, it is a simple matter of letting <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span> be the property of not belonging to concept <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\epsilon}f\)</span>,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[f(x) = \neg (x \frown \hat{\epsilon}f)\]</div>
<p>Whence the famed Russell’s Paradox emerges,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[x \frown \hat{\epsilon}f \equiv \neg (x \frown \hat{\epsilon}f)\]</div>
<p>Clearly, this should not be the case. Historically speaking, this annihiliated Frege’s logicist project, but the nature of the deduction which leads to this annihiliation would be the primary motive for the formal insights of Russell and Tarski. To show more clearly how this contradiction arises, consider the following  proof of one direction of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x \frown \hat{\epsilon}f \equiv f(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Assume <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x \frown \hat{\epsilon}f\)</span>.</p>
<p>From the definition of membership, there is a property <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi(x)\)</span> and the concept of this property <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\epsilon}\phi\)</span> is equal to the concept of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\epsilon{f}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The question, often known as the <em>Caesar Problem</em>, is how does one re-identify the property <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\)</span> with the property <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span>? This is where Frege’s Law V comes in; since the definition of membership yields the equality of concepts, Frege’s Law V allows the deduction to pass into the equivalence of properties,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\phi(x) = f(x)\]</div>
<p>Therefore, if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x \frown \hat{\epsilon}f\)</span>, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The key step is passing from the universal equality of concepts, an assertion of categorical relation, to an <em>instance</em> of the property denoted by the concept. Frege makes the same mistake as Aristotle (<span class="small">good company to keep</span>) in assuming a universal relation implies an existential relation.</p>

<p>From this, Tarski concludes that “<em>colloquial</em> <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>” is hopelessly inconsistent. <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#truth"><span class="std std-ref">Truth</span></a> <em>about</em> a <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> never exists <em>within</em> that language.

Therefore, to salvage the concept of “<a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#truth"><span class="std std-ref">truth</span></a>”, Tarski famously introduces the distinction between <em>meta</em> <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> and <em>object</em> <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>,</p>

<p>In other words, the notion of “<em>truth</em>” requires a bifurcation of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>. If we want the discourse to include predicates of “<em>is true</em>” or “<em>is false</em>”, <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> cannot be treated as one cohesive unit, where these assertions are carried out in the same <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> in which what is being asserted <em>is asserted</em>. This idea is only strange if <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> is regarded as something fixed and determinate. However, it is more apt to think of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> as a <em>continuous process that accumulates components of orthogonal meaning over time</em>. Each syntactic construct allows new semantic meaning to be encoded into the artifice of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>, and each new semantic concept integrated into the fabric of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> alters what is demarcated by its boundaries. In other words, <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> can only be conceived of as a whole at certain points in time, when its definitions are fixed by their factical origin in the world.

<p>Tarski’s parsimony of meta and object <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> shows that “<a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#truth"><span class="std std-ref">truth</span></a>” represents one of these transformative concepts that alters the very constitution of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> through its introduction and analysis. In essence, the concept of “<a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#truth"><span class="std std-ref">truth</span></a>”, through its rigorous integration into the corpus of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>, creates a schism in <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>.

<p>Frege believed all (coherent) semantic concepts in a language, such as “<em>belonging</em>”, could be derived from definitions made clearly with the formal laws of logic. His <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_LZ5tAAAAMAAJ/mode/2up">Grundgesetze Der Arithmetik</a> is an attempt to reduce the mathematical language of arithmetic to a logical calculus, through the use of prior assumptions (<a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/06_axiomata.html#frege-axioms"><span class="std std-ref">axioms</span></a>) and definitions such as the one given directly after this footnote,</p>

<p>It is often hard to translate Frege’s formalism into everyday language, as if Frege’s semantics are essentially alien to the actual mechanics of language. Frege is expressing insight in a language that bears only the faintest similarity to natural language.</p>

<p>—</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">Language</span></a>, if it can be defined at all, is the indeterminate totality which, by never containing itself (or existing), nessitates its progressive advance into novelty.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>When language ceases, so does life.</p>
<p>We spend our childhoods learning how to speak, threading our souls with symbols. Language acqusition is like a spell, a black magic ritual that induces in us the world. We are spoken into existence. Our lives are lived through the medium of speech.</p>
<p>All of these concepts accumulated through history, flowing into our heads through the currents of time, met in the external source of the world which unfolds in our senses. One marvels at the complexity. So many facts, shot through and through with interpretations. So many accidents and contingencies, indistinguishable in their effects.</p>
<p>In the murky factical origins of language, nothing is certain, but somethings are more certain than others. One cannot imagine a world without community. The self implies a multiplicity of selves. We must be bootstrapped with language, taught through ostension the ways in which things can relate to another, before the self as a concept may emerge as a relata within a relation, and this cannot happen without someone to draw attention to the ways in which symbols may represent that latent potential lurking. The “<em>self</em>” must be taught to us; it is an evolution of abstraction transmitted through language that manifests in our phenomenological life, in a directly analogous fashion to the way chains of DNA manifest phenotypes. The “<em>syntax</em>” of amino acids encodes the potentialites of life; the raw struggle of existence dictates which potentialities are activated, i.e. the “<em>semantics</em>” of DNA are determined by the ways in which the phenotypes interact with the existent world.</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine how a newborn infant could contain the potential for language, except through the possibility of absorbing it from another human. Language is only innate to the extent that is a potential of the human mind (and only then, at crucial periods during the development of the organism, as the case of feral children implies).</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>The world contrives, in its myriad ways, to convince you that you are not part of it. Every historical struggle reduces to this primordial human conflict, in some way. War is only possible in the presence of difference. To participate in conflict, there must be a “<em>them</em>” and an “<em>us</em>”, or more fundamentally, an “<em>other</em>” and an “<em>I</em>”. This psychological <a class="reference internal" href="../02_pedagogy/foundations/01_logic.html#tautologies"><span class="std std-ref">tautology</span></a> is precipitated in its pronouncement by the ontological foundations which allow it to manifest. To speak of tension and energetic relations, there must be external forces contending with internal forces in a quest for equilibrium. In order to cancel out, forces must be opposed. Conversely, all force can be decomposed into opposites.</p>
<p>The law of the excluded middle is a <a class="reference internal" href="../02_pedagogy/foundations/01_logic.html#logic"><span class="std std-ref">logical</span></a> artifact of the separation that divides things in their physical origin. Violence is a consequence of our nature, but an essential consequence (or at least, an essential possibility), one that follows syllogistically from the differentiation of the self from the world. The “<em>self</em>” is a name to identify particular thing. Every thing that is named is named insofar that it constitutes a singular thing; however multifoliate its presentation, through naming it is unified across its modes into a thing. A name is a record of separation, a symbol that bestows upon its recipient identity.</p>
<p>It is easy to take for granted the power of a name. We are given a name as soon as we enter the world, often well before. It is not inaccurate to say: each one of us is born <em>into</em> a name as much as we are born into a body. There is no difference, for our names indicate who we are, in all of its potentialities, physical or otherwise. This is the meaning of Kripke’s criticism of the “<em>Fregean theory of names</em>”. A name is not merely a <em>designation</em> or <em>description</em>, but a <em>baptism</em>. To name a thing is to inaugurate it into the possibilities of the world, as another item among the collection with the possiblity of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#being"><span class="std std-ref">being</span></a>.</p>
<p>It is even easier to take for granted there is <em>no inherent reason</em> we should have names. We could as well not have names; In fact, it almost certain that humans at some point in history did not have the concept of “<em>name</em>”. One might posit the emergence of “<em>names</em>” even further back in the mammalian lineage of humans, but regardless the point stands: <em>naming</em> is a privilege afforded by a particular evolutionary history. So many questions could be answered if we only had precise knowledge of the history that preceded our births, if we could somehow reconstruct the conditions of our ancestors who discovered they could <em>name</em> one another. What preceded and necessitated the discovery of <em>names</em>? Was it pure happenstance? Was a singular thing nominated to be named, or were several things simultaneously given names? Was there a point in history where only <em>one</em> name existed? Did humans realize immediately the sheer breadth of things that could named?</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Consider the two substantially different questions: Who was the first human to be named? What was their name? Now consider that, whatever the answer to these questions might be, the literal answer (i.e. the series of characters) is the same each case, but what is denoted by the answer is not.</p>
<p>In the first case, the answer to the question refers to the bearer of the name. In the second, it refers to the name itself. In other words, a name enables (formal) identity, but a name is <em>not</em> the same as (formal) identity. Or to be a finer linguistic point on it: a name is not identical to identity.</p>
<p>Tarski tells us names do not exist on the same logical level as the <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> in which the named things are used. A name is not an object; The name of a thing is a different type of thing than the thing itself.</p>
<p>Obviously, the name itself does not matter, as any symbol whatsoever can stand in place of a thing. In Tarski’s view, “<em>A contains B</em>” is the name of the sentence: A contains B. But this is only a matter of convention, albeit a deceptive convention that masks the nature of naming. We can as well agree to call the symbol <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ᛉ\)</span> the name of the sentence: A contains B. Tarski, instead of assigning arbitrary symbols to a name, expressed the name of a symbolic proposition with another symbolic proposition,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B \subset A\)</span>” if and only if A contains B.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This process of naming has no limit,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“”<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B \subset A\)</span>” if and only if A contains B.” if and only if “<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B \subset A\)</span>” if and only if A contains B.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Language does not seem possible without admitting that it’s nature is inextricably tied to the phenomenon of naming, and naming is not a coherent phenomenon unless language is allowed an infinite regress, forever synthesizing names and names of names and names of names of names and …</p>

<p>My thoughts are an endless circle. They always return to the point where they started, never having gained any further insight, never having accomplished anything. The same questions remain, except more complex and daunting for the depths that have been revealed. The same thoughts repeat and repeat, each time more muddled and lacking even more clarity. The recursion never ceases.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#world"><span class="std std-ref">world</span></a> is an ocean of contradiction upon contradiction, absurdity upon absurdity. It is a never-ending deluge of senselessness, a flood of utter desolation, tidal in its pull. It sinks all meaning beneath its surface. No structure remains standing in its wake.</p>
<p>The world will defy every expectation, slip every knot and dissolve in front of your eyes. Give it a name and it will immediately exceed that name, for now the totality of the world is now what was plus what has been named. <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#being"><span class="std std-ref">Being</span></a> refuses to be abstracted out of the <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#world"><span class="std std-ref">world</span></a>, for the abstraction cannot help but become part of the <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#world"><span class="std std-ref">world</span></a>.</p>
<p>How could it be otherwise? Would the questions have meaning if their answers were immediately rendered simply by asking? If our lives are to have meaning, unassailable in its foundations, then the <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#world"><span class="std std-ref">world</span></a> ipso facto must be inexplicable. If the <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#world"><span class="std std-ref">world</span></a> meant anything beyond the meaning we give it, then the meaning we find in the <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#world"><span class="std std-ref">world</span></a> would not be ours. But all meaning we find is by necessity <em>ours</em>, for it is impossible that a thought we think should be otherwise.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Those who question or outright deny the validity of faith often do so incorrectly. The argument of the atheist almost invariably reduces to: why is there suffering? This, however, is no argument at all, for it is riddled with unspoken assumptions and fallacies, such as assuming a divine nature must comport to human morality or that suffering serves no purpose.</p>
<p>To truly make the atheistic argument, one must understand what is meant by <em>faith</em>. One cannot argue in <em>good faith</em> against something they do not understand, so the true atheist must seek the nature of belief in God in order to demonstrate why it is not so.</p>
<p>The nature of faith is mostly precisely comprehended in Hume’s division of causality into necessity and sufficiency. The meaning of this statement is not immediately obvious and will require elaboration of these terms, “<em>necessity</em>” and “<em>sufficiency</em>”. Centuries after Hume, these notions would be formalized more precisely into the logical notion of equivalence, which also provides a visual and symbolic cue for understanding the exact meaning. Therefore, the meaning of these terms will be most easily approached by unpacking their modern formal definitions. Formally, <em>sufficiency</em> can be defined as,</p>
<aside class="topic">
<p class="topic-title">Sufficiency</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> is sufficent for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> if and only if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p \implies q\)</span></p>
</aside>
<p>If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> is known, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> is also known. However, a logical implication does not imply a causal implication. It may be the case <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> is false and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> is true. Knowing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> has <em>not</em> occurred is not <em>sufficient</em> for knowing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> has <em>not</em> occurred. In other words, <em>sufficiency</em> is positive knowledge. Knowing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> is true yields a deduction, but knowing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> is false yields nothing. This is what is meant by <em>sufficiency</em>.</p>
<p>For example, if one knows it is raining, that implies it is cloudy. But knowing it is cloudy does not imply it is raining. Therefore, the knowledge that it is raining is sufficient, but not necessary, for the knowledge that it is cloudy.</p>
<aside class="topic">
<p class="topic-title">Necessity</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> is necessary for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> if and only if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\neg p \implies \neg q\)</span></p>
</aside>
<p>By contrast with sufficiency, <em>necessity</em> is negative knowledge. If an implication is <em>necessary</em>, the knowledge its consequence is false immediately leads to the knowledge its hypothesis is false. This is often reexpressed using the law of contraposition (i.e. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q \implies p\)</span>), but this conversion into a positive expression hides the essential <em>negative</em> nature of necessity. Knowledge of necessity arises by observing the non-occurence of two events.</p>
<p>One must keep in mind the formal defintions of these terms are <em>syntactical</em> in nature. They express the <em>form</em> any causal relation must satisfy in <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>, but they are silent on the content thus expressed. For example, the following propositions satisfy the formal definitions given above,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}p = \text{&quot;the net force on the mass is non-zero&quot;}\\q = \text{&quot;the acceleration of the mass is non-zero&quot;}\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>If we know a mass is accelerating, then we know the net force acting on it is non-zero (<em>sufficiency</em>). If the net-force on a mass is zero, then we know its acceleration is also zero (<em>necessity</em>). Therefore, we conclude the force on a mass is necessary and sufficient for knowing the fact of its acceleration. Furthermore, while we may not be able to say precisely which is the cause of the other, it is nevertheless clear the relationship between these two descriptions can be labeled “<em>causal</em>”, meaning the knowledge of one event meaningfully affects the knowledge of the other event.</p>
<p>However, unfortunately, the formal definitions of sufficiency and necessity do not exclude <em>non-causal</em> relations from their satisfaction. For example, these propositions also satisfy the definition,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}p = \text{&quot;the length measures one foot&quot;}\\q = \text{&quot;the length measures twelve inches&quot;}\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>As another example,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}p = \text{&quot;the color is red or not red&quot;}\\q = \text{&quot;the color is never both red and not red&quot;}\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>In both cases, one would hardly say <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> is the <em>cause</em> of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span>, or visa versa. In other words, syntax alone is unable to determine which propositions constitute expressions of <em>causal</em> relations, for causality does not reside within the domain of formalism. The root of the causal problem lies in the insurmountable tension between intension and extension; this tension can be seen by noting the implication “<em>if 2 + 2 = 5, then Paris is the capital of France</em>” is a logically true proposition, and yet offers no meaningful knowledge for consumpation. Syntax (logic) can partition along the dimensions of <em>possible</em> and <em>coherent</em>, but is incapable of partitioning along the dimensions of <em>actual</em> and <em>meaningful</em>, except insofar that what is <em>actual</em> must also be <em>possible</em> and what is <em>meaningful</em> must also be <em>coherent</em>.</p>
<p>Beyond the syntactical considerations, one must be careful in the interpretation of these concepts, necessity and sufficiency. They should be understood in a Bayesian sense, insofar that the relation of implication between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> is never known <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#a-priori"><span class="std std-ref">a priori</span></a> and can only be established through observation. This point is important, yet extremely subtle so it bears closer analysis.</p>
<p>Hume argued that causality of events is inferred through the correlation of events, but is never definitively established. Implicit in this formulation is the idea that causal events are correlated, but correlated events are not <em>necessarily</em> causal <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#may-2025-05" id="id13" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>5<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>.</p>

<p>Jung argued the correlations of non-causal events constituted an orthogonal modality of ordering he termed <em>synchronicity</em>. He posited this modality as essential to the formation of the human psyche and its <em>archetypes</em>.</p>

<p>The problem of <em>faith</em> cast into the <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> of necessity and sufficiency is thus: God is sufficient for existence, but not necessarily necessary.

<p>The issue lies in how membership is determined.

Phonetics does not possess syntactic rules, in the sense that one cannot uniquely determine a phonetic pronouncation from the inscription of the word alone.

It is not <em>necessary</em> for there to be more iambic words than reflective words in a given language.

The direction of the relation cannot be proven, if by “<em>proven</em>” it is meant a logical argument that shows how, starting with the definition of reflective words and the definition of iambic words, their relative cardinality can be established. In other words, there is no formal deduction that links these two concepts together. The claim of their relative cardinality can only be understood by appeal to a dictionary and empirical evidence.</p>
<p>This example shows <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> possesses mutually independent dimensions, where scaling along one dimension need not affect how the language is expressed in another dimension. Furthermore, from this it follows a string from a <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a> inherently possesses several dimensions of length.</p>
<p>As an example of the preceding, consider the sentence,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>deduce the theorem now.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In terms of purely transcriptional dimensions, this sentence has a character length of 22 (including delimiters) and a word length of 4. Given the <a class="reference internal" href="../03_theurgy/02_palindromia/03_corpora.html#section-ii-ii"><span class="std std-ref">correct axiomatization</span></a> of <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#language"><span class="std std-ref">language</span></a>, it can be shown the character length of a string is bounded from below by the string’s word length, i.e. since every word must contain atleast one character, there must always be more characters in a sentence than words. This is an example of the sort of relative cardinalities that can be established when two concepts are categorically related.</p>
<p>However, the sentence may also be parsed along a phonetic dimension,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>de-DUCE the THEO-rem NOW</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Which makes clear this sentence has a stressed syllable length of 3 and an unstressed syllable length of 3, leading to a total syllable count of 6.</p>
<p>The following sentences have the same measurements,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>a dream awaits tonight / a DREAM a-WAITS to-NIGHT</p>
<p>the stars above appear / the STARS a-BOVE a-PPEAR</p>
<p>no path betrays escape / no PATH be-TRAYS es-CAPE</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>However, one can alter the character length and word length while leaving the syllabic lengths unaltered, as in,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>the wolf with sharpened claws / the WOLF with SHARP-ened CLAWS</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Which has a character length of 29, a word length of 5 and a syllable length of 6. Note that syllable length is bounded from below by the word length for the same reason as character length. Similarly, since every syllable must contain at least one character, the character length is always bounded from below by syllable length. Letting <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s(x)\)</span> represent the syllable length of a string <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>, the hierarchy of linguistic lengths is given as,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[w(x) \leq s(x) \leq c(x)\]</div>
<p>It is important to realize both <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_{-+}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R\)</span> are formally well-defined. Given a word, the conditions for its membership into either set can be precisely specified and determined. However, the sets exist in different domains of discourse. The properties which determine inclusion in one set do not (directly) affect the properties which determine inclusion in other set. To say the same thing a different way, the predicates of “<em>words</em>” have different modes.</p>
<p>One wants to say here: To know a word is iambic gives you no information whatsoever about whether or not it is reflective. Or to put it in conditional probabilistic terms: if one selects a random word from a corpus, the probability of it being iambic given no information about its syntactic structure is equal to the probability of it being iambic given the fact it is reflective.</p>
<p>However, this is not true. Indeed, while there is no <em>formal</em> argument that leads to the conclusion there are more iambic words than reflective, there is a <em>statistically</em> <a class="reference internal" href="../01_epistemia/04_lexicon.html#a-priori"><span class="std std-ref">a priori</span></a> argument that does not require direct observation of a corpus to demonstrate there is a compelling reason to believe that any language that contains enough words will almost assuredly contain more iambic words than reflective words.</p>
<p>The motivation for this argument can be seen by noting that an overwhelming amount of reflective word are monosyllabic, e.g. <em>eye</em>, <em>aha</em>, <em>nun</em>, <em>bob</em>, <em>pip</em>, <em>tot</em>, <em>sis</em>, <em>wow</em>, <em>sees</em>, <em>noon</em>, <em>stats</em>, etc. As the number of syllables in a word increases, the frequency of reflectivity decreases. A heuristic argument can be formulate along the following lines:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For an alphabet with N characters (including delimiters) and a word with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span> characters, there are potentially <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N^M\)</span> possible word-forms to use.</p></li>
<li><p>Out of these <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N^M\)</span> word-forms, (using combinatorial arguments), there are <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N^{\lceil M/2 \rceil}\)</span> possible reflective word-forms.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Consider selecting a random word with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span> characters. If the event of each character selection is treated as independent and identically distributed, then the probability of selecting a reflective word with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span> characters is approximately,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[P(R) = \frac{N^{\lceil M/2 \rceil}}{N^M} = \frac{1}{N^{\lfloor M/2 \rfloor}}\]</div>
<p>This shows, as the number of characters in a word increases, the probability of it being reflective drops exponentially. In other words, there is a combinatorial reason for reflective words occuring more frequently within the intersection of monosyllabic words. Monosyllabic words, by their nature, cannot be iambic. Moreover, monosyllabic words are finite, if it assumed every language has some upper bound for its syllabic lengths, e.g. the longest syllable in English is typically cited as 9 (“scrunched”). Once the monosyllabic words of a language have been assigned meanings, the possibility of randomly generating new reflective words diminishes rapidly. Therefore, as the number of words in a language increases, the probability of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(R | M_{-+})\)</span> decreases.</p>
