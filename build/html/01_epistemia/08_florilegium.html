<p><strong>Theatetus</strong>: And rightly.</p>
<p><strong>Socrates</strong>: Now see whether it is possible in the same way for one who possesses knowledge not to have it, as, for instance, if a man should catch wild birds–pigeons or the like–and should arrange an aviary at home and keep them in it, we might in a way assert that he always has them because he possesses them, might we not?</p>
<p><strong>Theatetus</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Socrates</strong>: And yet in another way that he has none of them, but that he has acquired power over them, since he has brought them under his control in his own enclosure, to take them and hold them whenever he likes, by catching whichever bird he pleases, and to let them go again; and he can do this as often as he pleases.</p>

<div><p>All that up to the present time I have accepted as most <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#truth"><span class="std std-ref">true</span></a> and certain I have learned either from the senses or through the senses; but it is sometimes proved to me that these senses are deceptive, and it is wiser not to trust entirely to anything by which we have once been deceived.</p>
<p>But it may be that although the senses sometimes deceive us concerning things which are hardly perceptible, or very far away, there are yet many others to be met with as to which we cannot reasonably have any doubt, although we recognize them by their means. For example, there is the fact that I am here, seated by the fire, attired in a dressing gown, having this paper in my hands and other similar matters. And how could I deny that these hands and this body are mine, were it not perhaps that I compare myself to certain persons, devoid of sense, whose cerebella are so troubled and clouded by violent vapours of black bile, that they constantly assure us that they think they are kings when they are really quite poor, or that they are clothed in purple when they are really without covering, or who imagine that they have an earthernware head or are nothing but pumpkins or are made of glass. But they are mad, and I should be any the less insane were I to follow examples so extravagant.</p>
<p>At the same time I must remember that I am a man, and that consequently I am in the habit of sleeping, and in my dreams representing to myself those same things or sometimes even less probable things, than do those who are insane in their waking moments. How often has it happened to me that in the night I dreamt that I found myself in this particular place, that I was dressed and seated near the fire, whilst in reality I was lying undressed in bed! At this moment it does indeed seem to me that it is with eyes awake that I am looking at this paper; that this head which I move is not asleep, that it is deliberately and of set purpose that I extend my hand and perceive it; what happens in sleep does not appear so clear nor so distinct as does all this. But in thinking over this I remind myself that on many occasions I have in sleep been deceived by similar illusions, and in dwelling carefully on this reflection I see so manifestly that there are no certain indications by which we may clearly distinguish wakefulness from sleep that I am lost in astonishment. And my astonishment is such that it is almost capable of persuading me that I now dream.</p>
<p>I suppose, then, that all the things I see are false; I persuade myself that <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#nothing"><span class="std std-ref">nothing</span></a> has ever existed of all that my fallacious memory represents to me. I consider that I possess no senses; I imagine that body, figure, extension, movement and place are but fictions of my mind. What, then, can be esteemed as true? Perhaps <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#nothing"><span class="std std-ref">nothing</span></a> at all, unless that there is <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#nothing"><span class="std std-ref">nothing</span></a> in this <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#world"><span class="std std-ref">world</span></a> that is certain.</p>

<div><p>That all our knowledge begins with experience there can be no doubt. For how should the faculty of knowledge be called into activity, if not by objects which affect our senses and which, on the one hand, produce representations by themselves or on the other, rouse the activity of our understanding to compare, connect, or to separate them and thus to convert the raw material of our sensible impressions into knowledge of objects, which we call experience? With respect to time, therefore, no knowledge within us is antecedent to experience, but all knowledge begins with it.</p>
<p>But though all our knowledge begins with experience, it does not follow that it all arises from experience. For it is quite possible that even our empirical knowledge is a compound of that which we perceive through impression, and of that which our own faculty of knowledge (incited by sense impressions) supplies from itself, a supplement which we do not distinguish from that raw material until long practice has rendered us capable of separating one from the other. It is therefore a question which deserves at least closer investigation and cannot be disposed of at first sight: Whether there is any knowledge independent of all experience and even of all impressions of the senses? Such knowledge is called “<a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#a-priori"><span class="std std-ref">a priori</span></a>” and is distinguished from empirical knowledge, which has its source “<a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#a-priori"><span class="std std-ref">a posteriori</span></a>”, that is, in experience…</p>

<div><p>I must here combat the view that, e.g. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2 + 5\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3 + 4\)</span> are equal but not the same. This view is grounded in the same confusion of form and content, sign and thing signified. It is a though one wanted to regard the sweet-smelling violet as differing from <em>Viola odorata</em> because the names sound different. Difference of sign cannot by itself be a sufficient ground for difference of the thing signified. The only reason why in our case the matter is less obvious is that the <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#bedeutung"><span class="std std-ref">Bedeutung</span></a> of the numeral 17 is not anything perceptible to the senses. There is at present a very widespread tendency not to recognize as an object anything that cannot be perceived by means of the senses; this leads here to numerals’ being taken to be numbers, the proper objects of our discussion; and then, I admit, 7 and 2 + 5 would indeed be different. But such a conception is untenable, for we cannot speak of any arithmetical properties of numbers whatsoever without going back to the <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#bedeutung"><span class="std std-ref">Bedeutung</span></a> of the signs. For example, the property belonging to 1, of being the result of multiplying itself by itself, would be a mere myth; for no microscopical or chemical investigation, however far it was carried, could ever detect this property in the possession of the innocent character that we call a figure one. Perhaps there is talk of a definition; but no definition is creative in the sense of being able to endow a thing with properties that it has not already got – apart from the one property of expressing and signifying something in virtue of the definition. The characters we call numerals have, on the other hand, physical and chemical properties depending on the writing material. One could imagine the introduction some day of quite new numerals, just as, e.g., the Arabic numerals superseded the Roman. Nobody is seriously going to suppose that in this way we should get quite new numbers, quite new arithmetical objects, with properties still to be investigated. Thus we must distinguish between numerals and their <em>Bedeutungen</em>; and if so, we shall have to recognize that the expression <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1 + 1\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3 - 1\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{6}{3}\)</span> all have the same :ref`bedeutung`, for it is quite inconceivable where the difference between them could lie. Perhaps you say, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1 + 1\)</span> is a sum, but <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{6}{3}\)</span> is a quotient. But what is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{6}{3}\)</span>? The number that when multiplied by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3\)</span> gives the result <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(6\)</span>. We say “<em>the</em> number”, not “<em>a</em> number”; by using the definite article, we indicate that there is only a single number.</p>

<blockquote class="epigraph">
<div><p>Equality gives rise to challenging questions which are not altogether easy to answer. Is it a relation? A relation between objects, or between names or signs of objects? In my <em>Begriffsschrift</em> I assumed the latter. The reasons which seem to favour this are the following: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a = a\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a = b\)</span> are obviously statements of differing cognitive value; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a = a\)</span> holds a priori and, according to Kant, is to be labeled analytic, while statements of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a = b\)</span> often contain very valuable extensions of our knowledge and cannot always be established a priori. The discovery that the rising sun is not new every morning, but always the same, was one of the most fertile astronomical discoveries. Even today the identification of a small planet or a comet is not always a matter of course. Now if we were to regard equality as a relation between that which the names ‘a’ and ‘b’ designate (<em>bedeuten</em>), it would seem that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a = b\)</span> could not differ from a = a (i.e. provided <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a = b\)</span> is true). A relation would thereby be expressed of a thing to itself, and indeed one in which each thing stands to itself but to no other thing. What is intended to be said by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a = b\)</span> seems to be that the signs or names ‘a’ and ‘b’ designate (<em>bedeuten</em>) the same thing, so that those signs themselves would be under discussion; a relation between them would be asserted. But this relation would hold between the names or signs only in so far as they named or designated something. It would be mediated by the connexion of each of the two signs with the same designated thing. But this is arbitrary. Nobody can be forbidden to use any arbitrarily producible event or object as a sign for something.</p>
<p>In that case the sentence <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a = b\)</span> would no longer refer to the subject matter, but only to its mode of designation; we would express no proper knowledge by its means. But in many cases this is just what we want to do. If the sign ‘<em>a</em>’ is distinguished from the sign ‘b’ only as object (here, by means of its shape), not as sign (i.e. not by the manner in which it designates something), the cognitive value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a = a\)</span> becomes essentially equal to that of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a = b\)</span>, provided <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a = b\)</span> is true. A difference can arise only if the difference between the signs corresponds to a difference in the mode of presentation of that which is designated. Let <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em> be the lines connecting the vertices of a triangle with the midpoints of the opposite sides. The point of intersection of <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> is then the same as the point of intersection of <em>b</em> and <em>c</em>. So we have different designations for the same point, and these names (’<em>point of intersection of a and b</em>’, ‘<em>point of intersection of b and c’</em>) likewise indicate the mode of presentation; and hence the statement contains actual knowledge.</p>
<p>It is natural, now, to think of there being connected with a sign (name, combination of words, letter), besides that to which the sign refers, which may be called the <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#bedeutung"><span class="std std-ref">Bedeutung</span></a> of the sign, also what I should like to call the sense of the sign, wherein the mode of presentation is contained. In our example, accordingly, the <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#bedeutung"><span class="std std-ref">Bedeutung</span></a> of the expressions ‘<em>point of intersection of a and b</em>’ and ‘<em>point of intersection of b and c</em>’ would be the same, but not their senses. The <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#bedeutung"><span class="std std-ref">Bedeutung</span></a> of ‘<em>evening star</em>’ would be the same as that of ‘<em>morning star</em>’, but not the sense.</p>
<p>It is clear from the context that by ‘<em>sign</em>’ and ‘<em>name</em>’ I have here understood any designation representing a proper name, which thus has as its <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#bedeutung"><span class="std std-ref">Bedeutung</span></a> a definite object (this word taken in the widest range), but not a concept or a relation, which shall be discussed further in another article. The designation of a single object can also consist of several words or other signs. For brevity, let every such designation be called a proper name.</p>
<p>The sense of a proper name is grasped by everybody who is sufficiently familiar with the language or totality of designations to which it belongs; but this serves to illuminate only a single aspect of the <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#bedeutung"><span class="std std-ref">Bedeutung</span></a>, supposing it to have one. Comprehensive knowledge of the <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#bedeutung"><span class="std std-ref">Bedeutung</span></a> would require us to say immediately whether any given sense belongs to it. To such knowledge we never attain.</p>
<p>The regular connexion between a sign, its sense, and its <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#bedeutung"><span class="std std-ref">Bedeutung</span></a> is of such a kind that to the sign there corresponds a definite sense and to that in turn a definite reference, while to a given <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#bedeutung"><span class="std std-ref">Bedeutung</span></a> (an object) there does not belong only a single sign. The same sense has different expression in different languages or even in the same language. To be sure, exceptions to this regular behaviour occur. To every expression belonging to a complete totality of signs, there should certainly correspond a definite sense; but natural languages often do not satisfy this condition, and one must be content if the same word has the same sense in the same context. It may perhaps be granted that every grammatically well-formed expression representing a proper name always has a sense. But this is not to say that to the sense there also corresponds a <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#bedeutung"><span class="std std-ref">Bedeutung</span></a>. The words ‘<em>the celestial body most distant from the Earth</em>’ have a sense, but it is very doubtful if they also have a reference. The expression ‘<em>the least rapidly convergent series</em>’ has a sense; but it is known to have no reference, since for every given convergent series, another convergent, but less rapidly convergent, series can be found.

<div><p>A concept - as I understand the word - is predicative. On the other hand, a name of an object, a proper name, it quite incapable of being used as a grammatical predicate. This admittedly needs elucidation, otherwise it might appear false. Surely one can just as well assert of a thing that it is Alexander the Great, or is the number four, or is the planet Venus, as that it is green or is a mammal? If anybody thinks this, he is not distinguishing the uses of the word ‘<em>is</em>’. In the last two examples it serves as a copula, as a mere verbal sign of predication. As such it can sometimes be replaced by the mere personal suffix. Compare, e.g., ‘<em>Dieses Blatt ist griin</em>’ and ‘<em>Dieses Blatt grunt</em>’.We are here saying that something falls under a concept, and the grammatical predicate stands for (<em>bedeutet</em>) this concept. In the first three examples, on the other hand, ‘is’ is used like the ‘equals’ sign in arithmetic, to express an equation. In the sentence ‘<em>The Morning Star is Venus</em>’, we have two proper names, ‘<em>Morning Star</em>’ and ‘<em>Venus</em>’, for the same object. In the sentence ‘<em>The Morning Star is a planet</em>’ we have a proper name, ‘<em>the Morning Star</em>’, and a concept word, ‘<em>planet</em>’. So far as language goes, no more has happened than that ‘<em>Venus</em>’ has been replaced by ‘<em>a planet</em>’; but really the relation has become wholly different. An equation is reversible; an object’s falling under a concept is an irreversible relation. In the sentence ‘<em>The Morning Star is Venus</em>’, ‘<em>is</em>’ is obviously not the mere copula; its content is an essential part of the predicate, so that the word ‘Venus’ does not constitute the whole of the predicate. One might say instead: ‘<em>The Morning Star is no other than Venus</em>’; what was previously implicit in the single word ‘is’ is here set in four separate words, and in ‘<em>is no other than</em>’ the word ‘<em>is</em>’ now really is the mere copula. What is predicated here is thus not Venus but no other than Venus. These words stand for (<em>bedeuteri</em>) a concept; admitedly only one object falls under this, but such a concept must still always be distinguished from the object. We have here a word ‘<em>Venus</em>’ that can never be a proper predicate, although it can form part of a predicate. The <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#bedeutung"><span class="std std-ref">Bedeutung</span></a> of this word is thus something that can never incur as a concept, but only as an object.</p>

<div><p>Dear colleague,</p>
<p>For a year and a half, I have been acquainted with your <em>The Foundations of Arithmetic</em>, but it is only now that I have been able to find the time for the thorough study I intended to make of your work. I find myself in complete agreement with you in all essentials, particularly when you reject any psychological element in logic and when you place a high value upon an ideography for the foundations of mathematics and of formal logic, which, incidentally, I find in your work discussions, distinctions, and definitions that one seeks in vain in the works of other logicians. Especially so far as function is concerned, I have been led on my own to views that are the same even in the details. There is just one point where I have encountered a difficulty. You state that a function, too, can act as the indeterminate element. This I formerly believed, but now this view seems doubtful to me because of the following contradiction. Let <em>w</em> be the predicate: to be a predicate that cannot be predicated of itself. Can <em>w</em> be predicated of itself? From each answer, its opposite follows. Therefore, we must conclude that <em>w</em> is not a predicate. Likewise there is no class (as a totality) of those classes which, each taken as a totality, do not belong to themselves. From this I conclude that under certain circumstances a definable collection does not form a totality.</p>

<div><p>The universe consists of objects having various qualities and standing in various relations. Some of the objects which occur in the universe are complex. When an object is complex, it consists of interrelated parts. Let us consider a complex object composed of two parts <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> standing to each other in the relation <em>R</em>. The complex object <em>“a-in-the-relation-R-to-b”</em> may be capable of being <em>perceived</em>; when perceived, it is perceived as one object. Attention may show that it is complex; we then <em>judge</em> that <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> stand in the relation <em>R</em>. Such a judgement, being derived from perception by mere attention, may be called a “<em>judgement of perception</em>.” This judgement of perception, considered as an actual occurence, is a relation of four terms, namely <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> and <em>R</em> and the percipient. The percetpion, on the contrary, is a relation of two terms, namely <em>“a-in-the-relation-R-to-b”</em> and the percipient. Since an object of perception cannot be nothing, we cannot perceive “<em>a-in-the-relation-R-to-b</em>” unless <em>a</em> is in the relation <em>R</em> to <em>b</em>. Hence a judgement of perception, according to the above definition, must be <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#truth"><span class="std std-ref">true</span></a>. This does not mean that, in a judgement which <em>appears</em> to us to be one of perception, we are sure of not being in error, since we may err in thinking that our judgement has really been derived merely by analysis of what was perceived.

<div><p>Vicious circles arise from supposing that a collection of objects may contain members which can only be defined by means of the collection as a whole. Thus, for example, the collection of propositions will be supposed to contain a proposition stating that “<em>all propositions are either true or false.</em>” It would seem, however, that such a statement could not be legitimate unless “<em>all propositions</em>” referred to some already definite collection, which it cannot do if new propositions are created by statements about “<em>all propositions</em>”. We shall, therefore, have to say that statements about “<em>all propositions</em>” are meaningless. More generally, given any set of objects such that, if we suppose the set to have a total, it will contain members which presuppose this total, then such a set cannot have a total. By saying that a set has “<em>no total</em>,” we mean, primarily, that no significant statement can be made about “<em>all its members.</em>”</p>

<div><p>The Greek expression <em>φαινόμενον</em>, to which the term “<a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#phenomena"><span class="std std-ref">phenomenon</span></a>” goes back, is derived from the verb <em>φαίνεσθαι</em> which signifies “<em>to show itself</em>”. Thus <em>φαινόμενον</em> means that which shows itself, the manifest. <em>φαίνεσθαι</em> itself is a middle-voiced form which comes from φαίνω — to bring to the light of day, to put in the light. <em>φαίνω</em> comes from the stem <em>φα</em> — , like the light, that which is bright — in other words, that wherein something can become manifest, visible in itself. Thus we must keep in mind that the expression “<a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#phenomena"><span class="std std-ref">phenomenon</span></a>” signifies that which shows itself in itself the manifest. Accordingly the <em>φαινόμενα</em> or “<em>phenomena</em>” are the totality of what lies in the light of day or can be brought to the light — what the Greeks sometimes identified simply with <em>τὰ ὄντα</em> (entities). Now an entity can show itself from itself  in many ways, depending in each case on the kind of access we have to it. Indeed it is even possible for an entity to show itself as something which in itself it is not. When it shows itself in this way, it “<em>looks like something or other</em>”. This kind of showing-itself is what we call “seeming”. Thus in Greek too the expression <em>φαινόμενον</em> (”<a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#phenomena"><span class="std std-ref">phenomenon</span></a>”) signifies that which looks like something, that which is “<em>semblant</em>”, “<em>semblance</em>”. <em>φαινόμενον ὰγαθόν</em> means something good which looks like, but “<em>in actuality</em>” is not, what it gives itself out to be. If we are to have any further understanding of the concept of <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#phenomena"><span class="std std-ref">phenomenon</span></a>, everything depends on our seeing how what is designated in the first signification of <em>φαινόμενον</em> (”<a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#phenomena"><span class="std std-ref">phenomenon</span></a>” as that which shows itself) and what is designated in the second (”<a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#phenomena"><span class="std std-ref">phenomenon</span></a>” as semblance) are structurally interconnected. Only when the meaning of something is such that it makes a pretension of showing itself — that is, of <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#being"><span class="std std-ref">being</span></a> a phenomenon — can it show itself as something which it is not; only then can it “<em>merely look like so-and-so</em>”. When <em>φαινόμενον</em>  signifies “<em>semblance</em>”, the primordial signification (the <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#phenomena"><span class="std std-ref">phenomenon</span></a> as the manifest) is already included as that upon which the second signification is founded. We shall allot the term ‘<a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#phenomena"><span class="std std-ref">phenomenon</span></a>’ to this positive and primordial signification of <em>φαινόμενον</em> and distinguish “<a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#phenomena"><span class="std std-ref">phenomenon</span></a>” from “semblance”, which is the privative modification of “<a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#phenomena"><span class="std std-ref">phenomenon</span></a>” as thus defined. But what both these terms express has proximally nothing at all to do with what is called an ‘appearance’, or still less a ‘mere appearance’.</p>

<div><p>Whenever we attempt to express the matter of immediate experience, we find that its understanding leads us beyond itself, to its contemporaries, to its past, to its future, and to the universals in terms of which its definiteness is exhibited. But such universals, by their very character of universality, embody the potentiality of other facts with varying types of definiteness. Thus the understanding of the immediate brute fact requires its metaphysical interpretation as an item in the world with some systematic relation to it. When thought comes upon the scene, it finds the interperations as matters of practice. Philosophy does not initiate interpretations. Its search for a rationalistic scheme is the search for more adequate criticism, and for more adequate justifications of the interpretations which we perforce employ. Our habitual experience is a complex of failure and success in the enterprise of interpretation. If we desire a record of uninterpreted experience, we must ask a stone to record its autobiography. Every scientific memoir in its records of the “facts” is shot through and through with interpretation. The methodology of rational interpretation is the product of the fitful vagueness of consciounsess. Elements which shine with immediate distinctness, in some circumstances, retire into pneumbral shadow in other circumstances, and into black darkness on other occasions. And yet all occasions proclaim themselves as actualities within the flux of a solid world, demanding a unity of interpretation.</p>

But if we ask ourselves at this point “what it is” which separates the subject from himself, we are forced to admit it is “<a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#nothing"><span class="std std-ref">nothing</span></a>”. Ordinarily what separates is a distance in space, a lapse in time, a psychological difference, or simply the individuality of two co-presents–in short, a “qualified” reality. But in the case which concerns us, “<a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#nothing"><span class="std std-ref">nothing</span></a>” can separate the consciousness of belief from belief, since belief is “nothing other” than the consciousness of belief.</p>

<div><p>Naturally, because the void is indiscernible as a term (because it is not-one), its inaugural appearance is a pure act of nomination. This name cannot be specific; it cannot place the void under anything that would subsume it–this would reestablish the one. The name cannot indicate that the void is this or that. The act of nomination, <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#being"><span class="std std-ref">being</span></a> a-specific, consumes itself, indicating <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#nothing"><span class="std std-ref">nothing</span></a> other than the unpresentable as such. In ontology, however, the unpresentable occurs within a presentative forcing which disposes it as the <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#nothing"><span class="std std-ref">nothing</span></a> from which everything proceeds. The consequence is that the name of the void is a pure <em>proper name</em>, which indicates itself, which does not bestow any index of difference within what it refers to, and which auto-declares itself in the form of the multiple, despite there <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#being"><span class="std std-ref">being</span></a> <a class="reference internal" href="04_lexicon.html#nothing"><span class="std std-ref">nothing</span></a> which is numbered by it.</p>
