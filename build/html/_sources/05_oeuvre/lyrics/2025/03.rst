IV: The World That Spins
------------------------

| The world that spins about its point,
|     That spun from loom these days,
| The one from sun that does anoint
|     As thread from time decays.
| I plucked a flower morning come
|     To save its life from woe.
| It wilted under press of thumb
|     In dying afterglow.
| Its soul through sweetly scented air
|     In secret met the gloam.
| Such poor design, so frail this share
|     That beauty makes a home.
| That afternoon we met at last
|     Though I with empty hands.
| There time removed from us amassed
|     The knots it wove through strands.
| Like vapor mist to sky dissolved
|     I wept at our good-bye,
| To see your eyes from dreams resolved
|     With nothing to reply.
