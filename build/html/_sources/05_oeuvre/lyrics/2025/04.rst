V: Ink (Librarian I)
---------------------

| With ink of jet, she shapes her world
|    With written, colored line,
| So contrary, she laughs and twirls
|     In library of mine.
|
| Around her arm, the ink in coil
|    Will paint the scene to set.
| Her skin is seared with burning oil
|    Where art in flame is met.
|
| Then up her neck, through nest of hair,
|    Where color threads are knit,
| The ink will bind in dye its share
|    Of strands she formed by writ.
|
| She flocks the books across the shelves
|    And tends her paper field,
| Her mind through story page so delves
|    As word to ink will yield.
|
| Library belle, my heart is smear and blot;
| It lacks but ink to find its way through plot.
