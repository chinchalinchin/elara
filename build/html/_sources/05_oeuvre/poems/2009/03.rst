IV: Dreams 
----------

| I dream of waves and tides
| of slippery skin and sand
| seashells like the shingles
| of some great underground structure
| whose columns support the ground
| and whose foundation holds tight 
| the heart of the Earth.
| 
| In my sleep, I wake
| from my sleep
| from the long thought
| thought by tall people
| thinking short thoughts.
| I stretch my muscles
| and crack my neck,
| touch my toes
| and run into the water.
