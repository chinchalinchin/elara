IV: Dystopia
------------

| First - The Haystruck Head
|
| In a distant future, where rhyming is a crime,
| Each metered sentence sentenced an irony of kinds,
| To be what is to be condemned,
| No finer end on offer.
| 
| And so our plaintiff finds himself, facing legal tempers,
| "Please explain these zippered little slippers?
| What treason to dress
| In these flat black slacks
| Upon your thighs which lie?"
| 
| In his defense, "No finer mind could scarce divine
| An outfit stitched in nothing, where words find lines,
| Despite my time, where threadbare seams
| Sewn inlaid dreams, in threads of no design!"
| 
| With a guffaw, a lawyer stands with a score of schooling,
| Slams his hands in mock remand, and argued such while drooling,
| "So you admit to this wit
| With which your garb comports?
| Such deviance detailed in resounding writ,
| Seals itself in short retort."
|
| The court strikes twelve, the twelve struck dead,
| They find in haystruck head a verdict over-muted,
| Which lolls and gags in city courtyards putrid,
| Teeth click-clacking like stark didacts
| Preaching to the bricks and blackness.
|
| Second - Poets Et Al
|
| The last ones were hunted in places they waxed poetic
| Across windswept fields, of forest clearings, in gardens copacetic,
| Yet for all of it, the tresses dressed in such lovely roses picked.
| The final rhyming couplets vied with the hounds bark brayed
| Encircled in arms, they died swift in circled stage:
|
| First went the Romantics, and love was lost. 
| Then went the Stoics, and naught was crossed.
| Then went the Classics, but no one missed them. 
| Next were the Playwrights and Poets Et Al,
| Any one fool who answered the call.
|
| Twelve nights they burned, twelve nights we wept,
| And then dreamless dreaming through the future we slept,
| Awoke and found a sudden desire expired,
| No more urge to imbue,
| To scatter and subdue,
| That which words clearly defy, the rhyming rhythm 
| In which life resides.
|
| Constitutions were written to codify:
| Kill all the poets, let poetry die. 
| Return it again
| The rooted treasure they had looted.
|
| Third - Ignore the Metaphor
|
| Watch as child to child between each haloo
| Hear the scattered echoes retreat and ensue.
| In this land of rhymeless ribbons, rhythm still is found.
| In the hamlets of branded outlaws each system such begets,
| Observe in silent moments poetry's fiery signets:
| 
| (Awake, flowers, tower higher every hour.
| Find, sentence, a sense of unending suspense.
| Sleep, children, with dreams of subtle schemes.
| Revel, rhymes, you are more than merely vessels.)
|
| How to ignore the metaphor 
| And resist the urge to write?
| A deadly sin
| But without skin,
| What games can we be had?
