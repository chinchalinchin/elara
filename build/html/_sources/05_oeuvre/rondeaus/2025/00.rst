I: The Winter Rondeau of Cumberland
-----------------------------------

| City of the Queen, wove from ancient thread,
| Strung with snow trails of spotted fawn and sled,
| Drape the hillside in winter's white ermine,
| Pray to sleep the flock from steeple shrine,
| Feast on the harvest, though the queen is dead
| Her spirit flies in death, descends to shine
|               On the fair City of the Queen.
|
| From tower bell, rivers rose with tears shed
| But her resting stone etched her last design
|               for the grand City of the Queen.
|
| Where the roads of black ebb to bricks of red
| Where hoof and rubber meet the twines of tread
| There along mountain tops soft trimm'd by pine
| There grows a flower from heights of steep incline
| Planted by tender hands unseen to spread
|                     Into the City of the Queen.
