| A hundred days would need a hundred more
| Before exhaust began to tame my heart.
| The wizened waves to rock decay the shore
| In time it takes for maps of you to chart.
|
| Yet minutes gone to ground will go too quick,
| Where sand in wind so whips you brief away,
| Each moment past with you now seems a trick,
| As staggered feet through surf are lost in spray.
|
| This isle I find myself at night marooned,
| Where thoughtless sleep is but a dream once held,
| Alone these times with fire I have communed,
| In cants of memories with you I dwell.
|
| Though lost at sea, amid unending storm,
| A thought, perhaps to be, with you and warm.
