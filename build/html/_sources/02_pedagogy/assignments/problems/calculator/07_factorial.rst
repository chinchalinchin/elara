Introduction
============

A factorial :math:`n!` is a type of mathematical operation that needed in probability calculations (among other places). Factorials arise through application of the Fundamental Counting Principle (TODO: insert link), as we shall presently see.

The definition of a factorial is given by,

.. math::

	n! = n \cdot (n -1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot ... \cdot 3 \ cdot 2 \cdot 1
	
Note, this definition does not work when the value of ``n`` is 0. For this reason, we define,

.. math::

	0! = 1
