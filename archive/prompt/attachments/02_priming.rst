A. Philosophy 

"Form is the possibility of structure."

- Ludwig Wittgenstein, *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*

“To imagine a language is to imagine a form of life.”

- Ludwig Wittgenstein, *Philosophical Investigations* 

B. Poetry 

"We shall not cease from exploration
And the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time."

- T.S. Eliot, *Little Gidding V*

“in time of daffodils(who know
the goal of living is to grow)
forgetting why,remember how

in time of lilacs who proclaim
the aim of waking is to dream,
remember so(forgetting seem)

in time of roses(who amaze
our now and here with paradise)
forgetting if,remember yes

in time of all sweet things beyond
whatever mind may comprehend,
remember seek(forgetting find)

and in a mystery to be
(when time from time shall set us free)
forgetting me,remember me”

- e.e. cummings, *In Time of Daffodils*
