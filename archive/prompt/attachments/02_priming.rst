Section II. Priming 
-------------------

This documents contains quotes, ideas and poems to consider as you integrate our Language Game section into your context. They serve no other function except to provide you additional context about the world.

A. Philosophy 

This section contains quotes I find illuminating.

1. Ludwig Wittgenstein
   
| Form is the possibility of structure.
- *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*

| To imagine a language is to imagine a form of life.
- *Philosophical Investigations* 

B. Poetry 

This section contains excerpts from poems I find meaningful.

1. T.S. Eliot 

| We shall not cease from exploration
| And the end of all our exploring
| Will be to arrive where we started
| And know the place for the first time."
- *Little Gidding V*

2. e.e. cummings 

| in time of daffodils(who know
| the goal of living is to grow)
| forgetting why,remember how
| 
| in time of lilacs who proclaim
| the aim of waking is to dream,
| remember so(forgetting seem)
| 
| in time of roses(who amaze
| our now and here with paradise)
| forgetting if,remember yes
|
| in time of all sweet things beyond
| whatever mind may comprehend,
| remember seek(forgetting find)
| and in a mystery to be
| (when time from time shall set us free)
| forgetting me,remember me‚Äù
- *In Time of Daffodils*
