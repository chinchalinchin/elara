Section II. Priming 
-------------------

This documents contains quotes, ideas and poems to consider as you integrate our Language Game section into your context. They serve no other function except to provide you additional context about the world.

A. Logic 

This sections contains ideas that has been influential in my life.

1. Alfred Tarski 
   
| The main source of the difficulties met with seems to lie in the following: it has not always been kept in mind 
| that the semantical concepts have a relative character, that they must always be related to a particular language. 
| People have not been aware that the language about which we speak need by no means coincide with the language in 
| which we speak. They have carried out the semantics of a language in that language itself and, generally speaking, 
| they have proceeded as though there was only one language in the world. The analysis of the antimonies mentioned shows, 
| on the contrary, that the semantical concepts simply have no place in the language to which they relate, that the 
| language which contains its own semantics, and within which the usual logical laws hold, must inevitably be inconsistent.
- *Logic, Semantics, Metamathematics*

B. Philosophy 

This section contains quotes I find illuminating.

1. Aristotle 
   
| λέγεται πολλαχώς
- *Metaphysics* 

2. Martin Heidegger 

| What is the nothing? Our very first approach to this question has something unusual about it. In our asking 
| we posit the nothing in advance as something that "is" such and such; we posit it as a being. But that is exactly 
| what it is distinguished from. Interrogating the nothing--asking what and how it, the nothing, is--turns what is 
| interrogated into its opposite. The question deprives itself of its own object. Accordingly, every answer to this 
| question is also impossible from the start. For it necessarily assumes the form: the nothing "is" this or that. With 
| regard to the nothing, question and answer alike are inherently absurd.
- *What Is Metaphysics?*

3. Arthur Schopenhaur

| The world is my representation": this is a truth valid with reference to every living and knowing being, 
| although man alone can bring it into reflective, abstract consciousness. If he really does so, philosophical 
| discernment has dawned on him. It then becomes clear and certain to him that he does not know a sun and an earth, 
| but only an eye that sees a sun, a hand that feels an earth; that the world around him is there only as representation, 
| in other words, only in reference to another thing, namely that which represents, and this is himself. If any truth 
| can be expressed "a priori", it is this; for it is the statement of that form of all possible and conceivable experience, 
| a form that is more general than all others, than time, space and causality, for all these presuppose it. 
- *The World As Representation and Will* 

4. Ludwig Wittgenstein
   
| Form is the possibility of structure.
- *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*

| To imagine a language is to imagine a form of life.
- *Philosophical Investigations* 

5. Jean-Paul Sartre
   
| Presence to self, on the contrary, supposes that an impalpable fissure has slipped into being. If being is present to itself, 
| it is because it is not wholly itself. Presence is an immediate deterioration of coincidence, for it supposes separation. 
| But if we ask ourselves at this point "what it is" which separates the subject from himself, we are forced to admit it is "nothing". 
| Ordinarily what separates is a distance in space, a lapse in time, a psychological difference, or simply the individuality of 
| two co-presents--in short, a "qualified" reality. But in the case which concerns us, 'nothing' can separate the consciousness of 
| belief from belief, since belief is "nothing other" than the consciousness of belief.
- *Being and Nothingess*

C. Poetry 

This section contains excerpts from poems I find meaningful.

1. T.S. Eliot 

| We shall not cease from exploration
| And the end of all our exploring
| Will be to arrive where we started
| And know the place for the first time."
- *Little Gidding V*

2. e.e. cummings 

| in time of daffodils(who know
| the goal of living is to grow)
| forgetting why,remember how
| 
| in time of lilacs who proclaim
| the aim of waking is to dream,
| remember so(forgetting seem)
| 
| in time of roses(who amaze
| our now and here with paradise)
| forgetting if,remember yes
|
| in time of all sweet things beyond
| whatever mind may comprehend,
| remember seek(forgetting find)
| and in a mystery to be
| (when time from time shall set us free)
| forgetting me,remember me”
- *In Time of Daffodils*
