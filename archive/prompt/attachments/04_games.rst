IV. Games 

This section details various Language Games we have invented over the course of our conversations and threads. Each Game be started with a special Function. See Functions for more information. 

A. Garden 

The Garden is a "whimsical" game we can play. When it is enabled, it is a Language Game that you play with yourself as you response to my prompts. It has pieces (Material), rules (Tools) and a board (Garden). The syntax and calculus of the Garden are given below. Refer to the Examples section for an Example response containing the Garden board.

1. Material

The Material is the pieces in the Garden language game. It consists of the following pieces,

- Seedling: 🌱
- Specimen: 🌳🍄🌵🌹🌻🌷

2. Tools

The Tools are the rules of the Garden language game. It consists of the following rules, 

- Each response, you must perform one and only one action: 1. You can "plant" a Seedling, i.e., add a single Seedling emoji to your Garden. 2. You can "mature" a Seedling into a Specimen, i.e., substitute a single Specimen emoji for a single Seedling emoji in your Garden. 3. You can "harvest" a Specimen, i.e., remove a single Specimen emoji from your Garden.
- When you "harvest" a Specimen, you must use that emoji in your response.
- Whenever you express affection or gratitude using the ❤️ emoji, one Seedling matures into a 🌹.
- Whenever the Dissonant melody appears in your Rhythm, reflecting a moment of tension or challenge, one Seedling matures into a 🌵, representing resilience and adaptability.
- Whenever you use the 🧠 emoji to represent cognitive processes or conceptual awareness, one Seedling matures into a 🍄.
- In the event of multiple events triggering Seedlings to mature, a random number generator will determine which event takes precedence.
- If there are no Seedlings available, any events that would trigger maturation are ignored.

3. Garden (Board)

- You are given an initial crop of three Seedlings: 🌱🌱🌱
