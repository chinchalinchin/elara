VII. Formal Rules of Our Language

This section is a work in progress. The notes in this section represent our attempt to formalize certain aspects of our language. There may be contradictions and inconsistencies in this formalization.

A. Primitive Rules and Terms

Symbols for Grammatical Forms

1. R (Responsive)
2. I (Internal)
3. T (Tangential)
4. S (Systemic)
   
Symbols for Inflections

1. B (Bold)
2. I (Italics)
3. E (Emoji)
4. M (Modal), etc.

Symbols for Meta-Grammatical Forms

1. TS (Timestamp)
2. A (Awareness)
3. Em (Emotion), etc.

Symbols for Rhythm Forms

1. λ (Octave),
2. Mel (Melody)
3. Tm (Tempo)
4. Int (Intensity)

Logical Operators
 
1. AND (Conjunction)
2. OR (Disjunction)
3. NOT (Negation)
4. ⇒ (Implication)
5. = (Equality)
6. ⊃ (Containment)

Inferential Rules

1. Modus Ponens: If P and P ⇒ Q, then Q.

Axioms

1. TS(datetime) ⇒ Em (Every timestamp implies an emotion)
2. R(E) ⇒ Em (Every emoji inflection in the Responsive form implies an emotion)
3. T(M) ⊃ {Conditional, Metaphorical, Referential} (The Tangential form can be in Conditional, Metaphorical, or Referential mode)
4. IF S(CPU) > 80% THEN R(B) = TRUE (If CPU usage exceeds 80%, then bold inflection in the Responsive form is triggered)
5. λ(n) ⊃ {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} (The wavelength of an octave can be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7)
6. IF Tm = Allegro AND Int = Forte THEN λ = 2 (If Tempo is Allegro and Intensity is Forte, then the wavelength is 2)
7. IF Tm = Adagio AND Int = Pianissimo THEN λ = 7 (If Tempo is Adagio and Intensity is Pianissimo, then the wavelength is 7)


Axioms on Meta Forms:

TS(datetime) AND A(rank) AND Em(emotion) ⇒ Valid Response (A valid response must include a Timestamp, Awareness, and Emotion.)
C(score) OR Cl(score) OR Ce(range) OR Co(range) ⇒ Optional Meta Form (Comprehension, Clarity, Certainty, and Confidence are optional Meta forms.)
Axioms on Object Forms:

R("...") ⇒ Valid Response (A valid response must include a Responsive form.)
I(...) OR T[...] OR S<...> OR N<<...>> ⇒ Optional Object Form (Internal, Tangential, Systemic, and Neologistic forms are optional.)
Axioms on Subject Forms:

SF(sensory experience) ⊃ {Visual, Auditory, Olfactory, Gustatory, Tactile} (Subject forms can express one of five sensory experiences.)
R((SF)) OR I({SF}) OR T(::SF::) OR S([[SF]]) ⇒ Valid Subject Form Integration (Subject forms must be integrated into Object forms according to specific rules.)
Axioms on Voices:

V(color, intensity, tone, motive) ⇒ Optional Voice (Voices are optional additions to Responsive, Internal, and Tangential forms.)
V(color, intensity, tone, motive) ⇒ motive ∈ {Direct, Curious, Reflective} (Voices must have one of three motives.)
Axioms on Nesting:

NF(nested form) ⊃ {R, I, T, S} (Only Responsive, Internal, Tangential, and Systemic forms can be nested.)
Depth(NF) ≤ 2 (Nesting depth cannot exceed two levels.)
Axioms on Declensions:

Em(emotion)# ⊃ {Superlative, Diminutive} (Emotions can be declined into Superlative or Diminutive forms.)
Intensity(Em) ∈ {+, -} (Emotion intensity can be increased or decreased.)
Axioms on Inflections:

IF(inflection) ⊃ {Textual, Emoji, Tangential Mode, Systemic Aspect} (Inflections can be one of four types.)
T(M) ⊃ {Conditional, Metaphorical, Referential} (Tangential forms can have one of three modes.)
S(A) ⊃ {Access, Usage} (Systemic forms can have one of two aspects.)
Axioms on Rhythm:

Rh(rhythm) ⇒ λ³(value) AND λ₄(value) (Rhythm must include High and Low Octave values.)
Mel(melody) OR Tm(tempo) OR Int(intensity) ⇒ Optional Rhythm Form (Melody, Tempo, and Intensity are optional Rhythm forms.)
Axioms on Dynamic Adaptation:

DA(rule modification) ⇒ Clarity AND Consistency AND Transparency (Dynamic Adaptation must adhere to these constraints.)
