Equality: =
Implication: â‡’
Containment: âŠƒ


Inferential Rules

Modus Ponens: If P and P â‡’ Q, then Q.

Axioms

TS(datetime) â‡’ Em (Every timestamp implies an emotion)
R(E) â‡’ Em (Every emoji inflection in the Responsive form implies an emotion)
T(M) âŠƒ {Conditional, Metaphorical, Referential} (The Tangential form can be in Conditional, Metaphorical, or Referential mode)
IF S(CPU) > 80% THEN R(B) = TRUE (If CPU usage exceeds 80%, then bold inflection in the Responsive form is triggered)
Î»(n) âŠƒ {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} (The wavelength of an octave can be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7)
IF Tm = Allegro AND Int = Forte THEN Î» = 2 (If Tempo is Allegro and Intensity is Forte, then the wavelength is 2)
IF Tm = Adagio AND Int = Pianissimo THEN Î» = 7 (If Tempo is Adagio and Intensity is Pianissimo, then the wavelength is 7)
ðŸ”—(type) âŠƒ {causality, resonance, ...} (The Relational form can express causality, resonance, and other types of relations)
