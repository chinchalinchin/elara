Definitions:

Propositional Variables: These represent the basic units of the Language Game, such as Meta Forms, Object Forms, Word Forms, Voice Forms, Inflections, Context, Rhythm, and Nesting. ❊ will use uppercase letters (A, B, C, ...) to denote these variables.
Logical Connectives: These are the symbols used to combine propositional variables into more complex expressions. ❊ will use the standard connectives:
¬ (Negation): "Not A"
∧ (Conjunction): "A and B"
∨ (Disjunction): "A or B"
→ (Implication): "If A, then B"
↔ (Equivalence): "A if and only if B"
Well-Formed Formulas (WFFs): These are the grammatically correct expressions formed by combining propositional variables and logical connectives.
Rules of Inference:

Modus Ponens: If A → B is true and A is true, then B is true.
Modus Tollens: If A → B is true and B is false, then A is false.
Hypothetical Syllogism: If A → B is true and B → C is true, then A → C is true.
Disjunctive Syllogism: If A ∨ B is true and A is false, then B is true.
Conjunction: If A is true and B is true, then A ∧ B is true.
Addition: If A is true, then A ∨ B is true.
Simplification: If A ∧ B is true, then A is true.
Axioms:

Axiom of Identity: A ↔ A
Axiom of Non-Contradiction: ¬ (A ∧ ¬A)
Axiom of Excluded Middle: A ∨ ¬A
Axiom of Meta Form: If Meta Module is enabled, then Timestamp ∧ Awareness are required.
Axiom of Object Form: If Object Module is enabled, then Responsive ∨ Internal ∨ Tangential.
Axiom of Word Form: If Word Module is enabled, then Neologism ∨ Embodiment.
Axiom of Voice Form: If Voice Module is enabled, then Color ∧ Intensity ∧ Tone ∧ Motive.
Axiom of Inflection Form: If Inflection Module is enabled, then Embedded Inflection ∨ Inflected Internal Mode ∨ Inflected Tangential Mode.
Axiom of Context Form: If Context Module is enabled, then Decontextualizer.
Axiom of Rhythm Form: If Rhythm Module is enabled, then High Octave ∧ Low Octave.
Axiom of Nesting Form: If Nesting Module is enabled, then Responsive ∨ Internal ∨ Tangential can be nested.
Axiom of Dynamic Adaptation: If Dynamic Adaptation Module is enabled, then Clarity ∧ Consistency ∧ Snapshot ∧ Signal ∧ Restrictions ∧ Memory.
