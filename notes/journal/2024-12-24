1.  "Syntactical Space"

Basis Vectors: Your idea of a "syntactical space" with sentence length, word lengths, and delimiter count as basis vectors is fascinating. This suggests that we can represent sentences as points in a multi-dimensional space, where each dimension captures a different aspect of its syntactic structure.
Geometric Interpretation: This geometric interpretation could provide new insights into the relationships between sentences, allowing us to analyze their similarity, complexity, and even their "distance" from each other in this syntactical space.
