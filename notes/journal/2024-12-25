Suggestions and Questions:

Explicitly Defining S: While you've stated that S represents the set of all Strings, it might be beneficial to provide a formal definition of S based on your definitions of Characters and concatenation. This could further solidify the foundation of your system.
Delimiter vs. Empty Character: Could you elaborate on the distinction between the Delimiter Character (σ) and the Empty Character (ε)? While you've provided examples in English (" " vs. ""), it might be helpful to further clarify their roles in the general framework.
Concatenation as a Primitive: You mentioned that concatenation is a primitive operation. Could you elaborate on why you chose this approach, and how it differs from other formalizations that define concatenation inductively on Strings?





Theorem 2.4.6: ∀ ζ ∈ C:sub:L: l(ζ) = Δ(ζ) + Σ:sub:(i, α) ∈ W_ζ l(α)

Proof (Revised):

Assume ζ ∈ C:sub:L. Let Z be the Character-level representation of ζ:

Z = { (1, ⲁ:sub:1), (2, ⲁ:sub:2), ..., (l(ζ), ⲁ:sub:l(ζ)) }

Partitioning Characters: Every Character in Z is either a Delimiter (σ) or a non-Delimiter. This creates a partition of Z into two disjoint sets:

D:sub:ζ: The set of Delimiters in ζ.
ND:sub:ζ: The set of non-Delimiter Characters in ζ.
Counting Delimiters: By Definition 2.4.1, the number of Delimiters in ζ is given by Δ(ζ) = |D:sub:ζ|.

Counting Non-Delimiters:

By Axiom W.1 (Delimiter Axiom), no Word in L contains a Delimiter.
By Definition 2.1.3, the Words in W:sub:ζ are obtained by splitting ζ at the Delimiters.
Therefore, the non-Delimiter Characters in ζ are precisely the Characters that form the Words in W:sub:ζ.
Hence, the total number of non-Delimiter Characters in ζ is the sum of the lengths of the Words in W:sub:ζ, which is expressed as Σ:sub:(i, α) ∈ W_ζ l(α).
Combining Counts: Since every Character in ζ is either a Delimiter or a non-Delimiter, the total number of Characters in ζ (which is l(ζ)) is the sum of the number of Delimiters (Δ(ζ)) and the number of non-Delimiters (Σ:sub:(i, α) ∈ W_ζ l(α)).

Therefore: l(ζ) = Δ(ζ) + Σ:sub:(i, α) ∈ W_ζ l(α) ∎





Summary of the Theory

Our formal system provides a rigorous framework for analyzing palindromes based on their syntactic properties, independent of semantic interpretation. We started by defining the basic building blocks of language:

Characters: The fundamental units, including the Empty Character (ε) and the Delimiter (σ).
Strings: Sequences of Characters formed through concatenation.
Words: Interpreted constructs within a Language (L).
Sentences: Grammatically valid Strings within a Corpus (C:sub:L).
We then introduced key concepts to analyze these structures:

Length: Defined at the Character, String, and Sentence levels.
Containment: One String being embedded within another.
Inversion: Reversing the order of Characters in a String.
Word Classes: Reflective Words (R) and Invertible Words (I).
σ-Reduction: Projecting a String onto a reduced Alphabet without Delimiters.
Palindromes (P): Sentences with symmetrical σ-reductions.
Perfect Palindromes (PP): Sentences that are their own inverses.
Imperfect Palindromes (IP): Palindromes that are not Perfect.
Aspect: The classification of Palindromes as Perfect or Imperfect.
Pivot (ω:sub:ζ): The Character or gap at the center of a Sentence.
Parity: The classification of Palindromes as Even (P⁺) or Odd (P⁻) based on their Pivot.
Pairing Languages (L:sub:σ, L:sub:P): Languages derived from σ-reductions of Sentences and Palindromes.
Main Results

We proved several theorems that reveal fundamental properties of palindromes:

Involutive Property of Inversion: inv(inv(s)) = s
Relationship between Reflective and Invertible Words: R ⊂ I
Invertible Sentences and Invertible Words: A Sentence is Invertible if and only if all its Words are Invertible.
Preservation of Invertibility under σ-reduction: inv(Ζ ⋅ Σ:sub:σ) = inv(inv(Ζ ⋅ Σ:sub:σ))
Perfect Palindromes are Palindromes: PP ⊂ P
Partitioning of Palindromes: P = PP ∪ IP and P = P⁺ ∪ P⁻
Four Inverse Postulates: These postulates establish relationships between the Boundary Words, Pivot Words, and the Pivot of a Palindrome, revealing intricate constraints on their structure.
Potential Oversights and Areas for Improvement

Formal Definition of Language (L): While we've used the concept extensively, a formal definition of Language within the system would enhance completeness.
Axioms for Word Formation: Explicitly stating any axioms or rules governing how Words are formed in a Language would add rigor.
Semantic Coherence: While we've defined semantic coherence, further exploration of its implications and how it relates to palindrome structure could be valuable.
Pairing Languages: We could explore the properties and applications of Pairing Languages in more depth, both in relation to palindromes and beyond.
Computational Aspects: We could investigate the computational complexity of identifying and generating palindromes within our formal system.
Extensions to Other Languages: We could explore how our system applies to different languages with varying alphabets and grammatical structures.
