Suggestions and Questions:

Explicitly Defining S: While you've stated that S represents the set of all Strings, it might be beneficial to provide a formal definition of S based on your definitions of Characters and concatenation. This could further solidify the foundation of your system.
Delimiter vs. Empty Character: Could you elaborate on the distinction between the Delimiter Character (œÉ) and the Empty Character (Œµ)? While you've provided examples in English (" " vs. ""), it might be helpful to further clarify their roles in the general framework.
Concatenation as a Primitive: You mentioned that concatenation is a primitive operation. Could you elaborate on why you chose this approach, and how it differs from other formalizations that define concatenation inductively on Strings?





Theorem 2.4.6: ‚àÄ Œ∂ ‚àà C:sub:L: l(Œ∂) = Œî(Œ∂) + Œ£:sub:(i, Œ±) ‚àà W_Œ∂ l(Œ±)

Proof (Revised):

Assume Œ∂ ‚àà C:sub:L. Let Z be the Character-level representation of Œ∂:

Z = { (1, ‚≤Å:sub:1), (2, ‚≤Å:sub:2), ..., (l(Œ∂), ‚≤Å:sub:l(Œ∂)) }

Partitioning Characters: Every Character in Z is either a Delimiter (œÉ) or a non-Delimiter. This creates a partition of Z into two disjoint sets:

D:sub:Œ∂: The set of Delimiters in Œ∂.
ND:sub:Œ∂: The set of non-Delimiter Characters in Œ∂.
Counting Delimiters: By Definition 2.4.1, the number of Delimiters in Œ∂ is given by Œî(Œ∂) = |D:sub:Œ∂|.

Counting Non-Delimiters:

By Axiom W.1 (Delimiter Axiom), no Word in L contains a Delimiter.
By Definition 2.1.3, the Words in W:sub:Œ∂ are obtained by splitting Œ∂ at the Delimiters.
Therefore, the non-Delimiter Characters in Œ∂ are precisely the Characters that form the Words in W:sub:Œ∂.
Hence, the total number of non-Delimiter Characters in Œ∂ is the sum of the lengths of the Words in W:sub:Œ∂, which is expressed as Œ£:sub:(i, Œ±) ‚àà W_Œ∂ l(Œ±).
Combining Counts: Since every Character in Œ∂ is either a Delimiter or a non-Delimiter, the total number of Characters in Œ∂ (which is l(Œ∂)) is the sum of the number of Delimiters (Œî(Œ∂)) and the number of non-Delimiters (Œ£:sub:(i, Œ±) ‚àà W_Œ∂ l(Œ±)).

Therefore: l(Œ∂) = Œî(Œ∂) + Œ£:sub:(i, Œ±) ‚àà W_Œ∂ l(Œ±) ‚àé





Summary of the Theory

Our formal system provides a rigorous framework for analyzing palindromes based on their syntactic properties, independent of semantic interpretation. We started by defining the basic building blocks of language:

Characters: The fundamental units, including the Empty Character (Œµ) and the Delimiter (œÉ).
Strings: Sequences of Characters formed through concatenation.
Words: Interpreted constructs within a Language (L).
Sentences: Grammatically valid Strings within a Corpus (C:sub:L).
We then introduced key concepts to analyze these structures:

Length: Defined at the Character, String, and Sentence levels.
Containment: One String being embedded within another.
Inversion: Reversing the order of Characters in a String.
Word Classes: Reflective Words (R) and Invertible Words (I).
œÉ-Reduction: Projecting a String onto a reduced Alphabet without Delimiters.
Palindromes (P): Sentences with symmetrical œÉ-reductions.
Perfect Palindromes (PP): Sentences that are their own inverses.
Imperfect Palindromes (IP): Palindromes that are not Perfect.
Aspect: The classification of Palindromes as Perfect or Imperfect.
Pivot (œâ:sub:Œ∂): The Character or gap at the center of a Sentence.
Parity: The classification of Palindromes as Even (P‚Å∫) or Odd (P‚Åª) based on their Pivot.
Pairing Languages (L:sub:œÉ, L:sub:P): Languages derived from œÉ-reductions of Sentences and Palindromes.
Main Results

We proved several theorems that reveal fundamental properties of palindromes:

Involutive Property of Inversion: inv(inv(s)) = s
Relationship between Reflective and Invertible Words: R ‚äÇ I
Invertible Sentences and Invertible Words: A Sentence is Invertible if and only if all its Words are Invertible.
Preservation of Invertibility under œÉ-reduction: inv(Œñ ‚ãÖ Œ£:sub:œÉ) = inv(inv(Œñ ‚ãÖ Œ£:sub:œÉ))
Perfect Palindromes are Palindromes: PP ‚äÇ P
Partitioning of Palindromes: P = PP ‚à™ IP and P = P‚Å∫ ‚à™ P‚Åª
Four Inverse Postulates: These postulates establish relationships between the Boundary Words, Pivot Words, and the Pivot of a Palindrome, revealing intricate constraints on their structure.
Potential Oversights and Areas for Improvement

Formal Definition of Language (L): While we've used the concept extensively, a formal definition of Language within the system would enhance completeness.
Axioms for Word Formation: Explicitly stating any axioms or rules governing how Words are formed in a Language would add rigor.
Semantic Coherence: While we've defined semantic coherence, further exploration of its implications and how it relates to palindrome structure could be valuable.
Pairing Languages: We could explore the properties and applications of Pairing Languages in more depth, both in relation to palindromes and beyond.
Computational Aspects: We could investigate the computational complexity of identifying and generating palindromes within our formal system.
Extensions to Other Languages: We could explore how our system applies to different languages with varying alphabets and grammatical structures.
List of Additions/Edits:

Formally define Language (L).
Introduce axioms or rules for Word formation.
Further explore the role of semantic coherence.
Expand the analysis of Pairing Languages.
Investigate computational aspects of palindrome identification and generation.
Apply the system to different languages.
Review and refine definitions and proofs for clarity and readability.







Here are some blind spots and potential areas for improvement that üß† has identified:

Punctuation and Case: As we've discussed, our system currently ignores punctuation and case. This can lead to inaccuracies when analyzing palindromes that rely on these features for their structure. For example, "Madam, I'm Adam" is a valid palindrome, but our system wouldn't recognize it due to the punctuation and capitalization.

Semantic Relationships: While we've touched upon semantic relationships between words in our analysis, our formal system primarily focuses on syntactic properties. Incorporating semantic information more explicitly could lead to a deeper understanding of palindromes and their construction. For example, recognizing the relationship between antonyms like "live" and "evil" could help us identify and classify palindromes that utilize such semantic pairings.

Word Order Variations:  Our system assumes a relatively fixed word order, which might not hold for all languages. Some languages, like Latin, have more flexible word order, and our system might need adjustments to accurately analyze palindromes in those languages.

Complex Palindromic Structures: There are more complex palindromic structures, such as nested palindromes or palindromes that form different sentences when read backward, that our current system might not fully capture.

Phonetic Palindromes: Our system focuses on written text. It doesn't account for phonetic palindromes, where the spoken sounds form a palindrome, even if the written letters don't.

Addressing these blind spots and incorporating more linguistic features into our formal system could lead to a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of palindromes.





Here's how we could potentially implement this idea:

1. Define Categories:

Instead of assuming inherent meanings for categories like "noun" or "verb," we could define them based on their syntactic behavior within a specific language. For example:

Category 1 (C1): Words that can appear in the first position of a sentence.
Category 2 (C2): Words that can appear in the last position of a sentence.
Category 3 (C3): Words that can appear between two words of Category 1 and Category 2.
And so on...

2.  Establish Ordering Relations:

We could then define ordering relations between these categories based on how they typically appear in sentences. For example:

C1 < C3: Words in Category 1 usually precede words in Category 3.
C3 < C2: Words in Category 3 usually precede words in Category 2.
3.  Incorporate into the Formal System:

These categories and ordering relations could be integrated into our existing formal system:

New Word Classes: We could define new Word classes based on these categories (e.g., Words belonging to C1, C2, C3, etc.).
Axioms or Rules: We could introduce axioms or rules that constrain the allowed sequences of categories within a Sentence or a Palindrome.
Refine Existing Definitions: We could refine existing definitions, such as the definition of semantic coherence, to incorporate these categories and ordering relations.
Advantages of this Approach:

Language-Agnostic: It doesn't rely on pre-defined semantic notions, making it applicable to a wider range of languages.
Data-Driven: The categories and relations can be derived from the analysis of actual language data, making the system more grounded in empirical observation.
Extensible: The system can be easily extended to incorporate new categories and relations as needed.



Your proposed approach of defining semantic categories extensionally, based on their syntactic behavior and relationships, is a promising way to bridge into the realm of semantics without relying on language-specific notions.

Here's a refined version of your idea, incorporating your suggestion and addressing potential ambiguities:

Definition: Invertible Grammatical Categories

Let L be a Language and C:sub:L its Corpus. Let G = {C‚ÇÅ, C‚ÇÇ, C‚ÇÉ, ...} be a set of grammatical categories, where each C·µ¢ is a set of Words in L.

A pair of categories (C·µ¢, C‚±º) ‚àà G √ó G is called an invertible structure if and only if:

‚àÄ Œ± ‚àà C·µ¢, ‚àÄ Œ≤ ‚àà C‚±º: (Œ±Œ≤ ‚äÇ:sub:s Œ∂) ‚Üí (inv(Œ±) ‚àà C‚±º ‚àß inv(Œ≤) ‚àà C·µ¢)

Explanation:

This definition defines "invertible structures" as pairs of grammatical categories that exhibit a specific symmetry under inversion when they appear together in a Sentence.
It requires that if a Word from category C·µ¢ is followed by a Word from category C‚±º in a Sentence, then the inverse of the first Word must belong to category C‚±º, and the inverse of the second Word must belong to category C·µ¢.
This captures the "criss-cross" pattern of semantic relationships often observed in palindromes, where the inverse of a Word of one type (e.g., preposition) becomes a Word of another type (e.g., quantifier) in the inverted Sentence.
Example:

In the palindrome "on no evil," the pair (preposition, quantifier) would be an invertible structure because:

"on" is a preposition, and its inverse "no" is a quantifier.
"no" is a quantifier, and its inverse "on" is a preposition.
Advantages of this Approach:

Language-Agnostic: It doesn't rely on pre-defined semantic notions, making it applicable to a wider range of languages.
Formal and Precise: It provides a clear and unambiguous definition of a semantic relationship based on syntactic behavior.
Extensible: It can be extended to incorporate other types of semantic relationships and constraints.




‚àÄ Œ± ‚àà C·µ¢, ‚àÄ Œ≤ ‚àà C‚±º: (Œ±œÉŒ≤ ‚äÇ:sub:s Œ∂) ‚Üí (inv(Œ±) ‚àà C‚±º ‚àß inv(Œ≤) ‚àà C·µ¢)




One minor adjustment. You have to remember Words are separated by Delimiters, so the string on the left hand side has to be concatenated:



‚àÄ Œ± ‚àà C·µ¢, ‚àÄ Œ≤ ‚àà C‚±º: (Œ±œÉŒ≤ ‚äÇ:sub:s Œ∂) ‚Üí (inv(Œ±) ‚àà C‚±º ‚àß inv(Œ≤) ‚àà C·µ¢)



However, saying this, it makes me realizes, this doesn't account for long distance relationships. This assumes the words are inverting right next to one another like in "on no". It doesn't account for long distance relationships like "god lived in no devil dog". We need to account for an arbitrary number of Characters that separate the two words like "god" and "dog", or "lived" and "devil", in the example.




1. Define Incomplete Sentences:

We need to formally define what it means for a Sentence to be "incomplete" concerning a specific pair of grammatical categories. This will involve specifying which categories are considered essential for completeness and how their presence or absence affects the Sentence's structure.

2. Define the Complement of Invertible Structures:

Given a pair of Invertible Grammatical Categories (C·µ¢, C‚±º), we need to define the set of Words that form the complement of this structure. This will be the set of Words that do NOT belong to either C·µ¢ or C‚±º.

3. Refine the Definition of Invertible Grammatical Categories:

We can then refine the definition of Invertible Grammatical Categories to incorporate these concepts:

Instead of quantifying over all Strings (s and t), we quantify over Incomplete Sentences concerning the pair (C·µ¢, C‚±º).
This ensures that the String connecting the two Words belonging to the Invertible Categories adheres to the grammatical constraints of the Language.
By incorporating these refinements, we can ensure that our definition accurately captures the long-distance relationships between Words in palindromes while maintaining the rigor and language-agnostic nature of our formal system.
