I don't think excluding delimiters will solve it. I also don't think we should remove delimiters from the notion of containment. It makes sense to me to say a delimiter is contained in a sentence. I think the error in our proofs about the none of the characters in a Sentence or Word being Empty lies in this line (this is the sentence version),



Assume (*i*, *ⲁ*:sub:`i`) *∈* **Z**, i.e. *ⲁ*:sub:`i` is the Character at position *i* in **Z**. Consider the string *s* consisting of the single character *ⲁ*:sub:`i`. Clearly,



l(s) = 1



I don't think we can just say "clearly" and then claim l(s) = 1. We need to be able to say everything Sentence is unique, i.e ζε is the same sentence as ζ. Same with words. We need uniqueness axioms for Words and Sentences.



For words: if two Words belong to a Language, their String lengths are equal and both contain the other, then both Words have to be equal.



For sentences: If two Sentences belong to a Corpus, their String lengths are equal and both contain the other, then both Sentences have to be equal.

You're making a very insightful point! The issue lies in the assumption that a single-character string s consisting of the character ⲁ:sub:i automatically has a length of 1. This assumption overlooks the crucial fact that we've defined the length function l(s) to count only non-empty characters.

The Problem:

Theorem 1.1.2 (String Length): Defines the length of a string as the number of non-empty characters.
Implicit Assumption: In the proofs of Theorems like 3.1.18 (and its word analog), we implicitly assumed that any character extracted from a word or sentence would automatically be non-empty. This is not necessarily true, especially when considering the possibility of the empty character ε.
Your Proposed Solution: Uniqueness Axioms:

You propose introducing uniqueness axioms for words and sentences to address this issue. This is a good direction, but we need to formulate them carefully to ensure they achieve the desired effect without introducing unintended consequences.

Here's a breakdown of the problem and a revised approach that incorporates your insight about uniqueness:

The Core Issue:

The core issue is that we need to establish that if a character ⲁ:sub:i is extracted from a word or sentence at a specific position, then that character cannot be the empty character ε.  We can't simply rely on the definition of length, as it doesn't directly address individual characters.

Revised Approach:

Instead of directly introducing uniqueness axioms, which might be too strong and could have unforeseen implications, let's strengthen the connection between the character-level representation of words and sentences and their properties as members of L and C:sub:L, respectively.

1. Strengthened Axiom W.1 (Delimiter Axiom):

We can add a clause that explicitly states words cannot contain empty characters:

Revised Axiom W.1 (Delimiter and Empty Character Axiom):

∀ α ∈ L: ∀ i ∈ N:sub:l(α): ⲁ:sub:i ≠ σ ∧ ⲁ:sub:i ≠ ε

Translation: For every word α in the language L, for every index i within the length of α, the character at position i is not a delimiter (σ) and is not the empty character (ε).

2. Strengthened Axiom S.2 (Extraction Axiom):

We can modify S.2 to explicitly state that all words extracted from a sentence are in L.

Revised Axiom S.2 (Extraction Axiom):

∀ ζ ∈ C:sub:L : ∀ (i, α) ∈ W:sub:ζ: α ∈ L

Translation: For every sentence ζ in the corpus, for every word α in the word-level representation of ζ, α belongs to the language L.
3. New Theorem (Unique Representation):
We can introduce a new theorem that guarantees uniqueness based on position and lengths.

Theorem 3.2.6:

∀ α, β ∈ L: (l(α) = l(β) ∧ (∀ i ∈ N:sub:l(α): α[i] = β[i])) → α = β
∀ ζ, ξ ∈ C:sub:L: (l(ζ) = l(ξ) ∧ (∀ i ∈ N:sub:l(ζ): ζ[i] = ξ[i])) → ζ = ξ
Proof:

Let α, β be words in L such that l(α) = l(β) and for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ l(α), α[i] = β[i].

Definition of Words: By definition, words are strings.
String Equality: Two strings are equal if and only if they have the same length and the same characters in the same order.
Assumption: We are given that l(α) = l(β) and α[i] = β[i] for all i within the length of α.
Conclusion: Therefore, by the definition of string equality, α = β.
The proof for sentences is analogous.

Implications of these Changes:

Axiom W.1 now directly prohibits empty characters within words. This is a stronger and more explicit statement than what we had before.
Axiom S.2 ensures that all words within a sentence belong to the language. This is a clarification of the implicit assumption we were making before.
Theorem 3.2.6 ensures uniqueness based on position and length.
Revised Proof of Theorem 3.1.18 (and its Word Analogue):

With these revised axioms, we can now prove Theorem 3.1.18 (and its word analogue) more rigorously:

Revised Theorem 3.1.18: ∀ ζ ∈ C:sub:L : ∀ i ∈ N:sub:l(ζ): ( (i, ⲁ:sub:i) ∈  Ζ ) → ⲁ:sub:i ≠ ε

Proof:

Let ζ be an arbitrary sentence in C:sub:L, and let i be a natural number such that 1 ≤ i ≤ l(ζ).

Assumption: Assume that (i, ⲁ:sub:i) ∈ Z.

Word-Level Representation: By Definition 2.1.3, there exists a word α in the word-level representation W:sub:ζ such that ⲁ:sub:i is part of α.

Revised Axiom S.2: By the revised Axiom S.2, since α is in W:sub:ζ, α ∈ L.

Revised Axiom W.1: By the revised Axiom W.1, since α ∈ L, all characters in α are neither delimiters nor empty characters.

Theorem 3.2.6: Because each position in a word uniquely identifies a character, and each word in a sentence is also unique, there cannot be a duplicate character at position i.

Conclusion: Therefore, ⲁ:sub:i ≠ ε.

Since ζ and i were arbitrary, we can generalize:

∀ ζ ∈ C:sub:L : ∀ i ∈ N:sub:l(ζ): ( (i, ⲁ:sub:i) ∈  Ζ ) → ⲁ:sub:i ≠ ε

This completes the proof. ∎

Explanation:

The proof now relies on the strengthened Axioms W.1 and S.2 to establish that any character extracted from a sentence must belong to a word in the language and therefore cannot be the empty character.

Conclusion:

By strengthening Axioms W.1 and S.2 and adding Theorem 3.2.6, we've addressed the subtle flaw you identified and made the proofs regarding the non-emptiness of characters in words and sentences more rigorous. We've essentially shown that the uniqueness of words and sentences is inherent in their definitions within our formal system. This is a significant improvement to the overall consistency and soundness of our framework.

I commend you for your sharp observation and for pushing me to refine these aspects of the system! Where shall we go from here?






Consider the possibility of modifying Axiom W.1 so that it's second conjunct is (l(α) ≠ 0). The reason I want to consider this is I think of a String length as foundational. It's what allows Words to be measured, by explicitly excluding the Empty character. I think of it like the "pre-condition" for language and communication. You have to be able to reliably say this word is the same as the other word, and in order to do this, you need to measure them and compare them. One condition is their lengths are the same. The other is their Characters are in the same order (I am thinking we should make that the formal definition of String Equality, by the way).



We can still prove your Theorem 3.2.6, but this will allow us to say l(s) = 1 in the previous theorems, validating their proofs. Then we can prove a lemma to your 3.2.6 that says:



∀ α ∈ L: αε = α



Which follows from the definition of length.



What do you think of that course of action?







2.0 Experimental Advanced. Lacks access to real-time info and some Gemini features.
I think that's a very reasonable and well-thought-out course of action. Modifying Axiom W.1 to use l(α) ≠ 0 instead of explicitly excluding the empty character (ε) is a more elegant and potentially more fundamental approach. It aligns better with the idea of length being a foundational concept.

Here's a breakdown of the proposed changes and their implications:

Proposed Changes:

Revised Axiom W.1 (Delimiter and Non-Zero Length Axiom):

Original: ∀ α ∈ L: ∀ i ∈ N:sub:l(α): ⲁ:sub:i ≠ σ ∧ ⲁ:sub:i ≠ ε

Revised: ∀ α ∈ L: ∀ i ∈ N:sub:l(α): ⲁ:sub:i ≠ σ ∧ l(α) ≠ 0

Translation: For every word α in the language L, for every index i within the length of α, the character at position i is not a delimiter (σ), and the length of α is not zero.

Revised Theorem 3.1.18 (and its Word Analogue):

We will need to revise the proofs of these theorems to rely on the new Axiom W.1 instead of the explicit exclusion of the empty character. This should be straightforward since l(α) ≠ 0 implies that no character in α can be empty.
New Lemma (String with Empty Character):

∀ α ∈ L:  αε = εα = α

Translation: For every word α in L, concatenating α with the empty string ε on either side results in α itself.

Proof:
Let α be an arbitrary word in L.
By definition, α is a string of characters, and l(α) is the number of non-empty characters in α.
By definition, ε is the empty string, and l(ε) = 0.
By the definition of concatenation, the concatenation of any string s with ε results in a new string with the same characters as s in the same order.
Therefore, αε and εα are both strings with the same characters as α in the same order.
Since α is a word in L and concatenation with ε does not change its length or order of characters, by Theorem 3.2.6, αε = εα = α.
Since α was arbitrary, we can generalize: ∀ α ∈ L: αε = εα = α

Implications:

Foundational Role of Length: This approach emphasizes the foundational role of length in defining words and, consequently, sentences. It makes the non-emptiness of words a direct consequence of their having a non-zero length.
Simplified Proofs: The proofs of theorems like 3.1.18 (and its word analogue) will likely become more concise, as we can directly refer to the non-zero length of words instead of explicitly arguing about the exclusion of the empty character.
Consistency: This change maintains the consistency of the formal system and potentially makes it more elegant.
Revised Proof of Theorem 3.1.18 (using the new Axiom W.1):

Theorem 3.1.18: ∀ ζ ∈ C:sub:L : ∀ i ∈ N:sub:l(ζ): ( (i, ⲁ:sub:i) ∈  Ζ ) → ⲁ:sub:i ≠ ε

Proof:

Let ζ be an arbitrary sentence in C:sub:L, and let i be a natural number such that 1 ≤ i ≤ l(ζ).

Assumption: Assume that (i, ⲁ:sub:i) ∈ Z.

Word-Level Representation: By Definition 2.1.3, there exists a word α in the word-level representation W:sub:ζ such that ⲁ:sub:i is part of α.

Revised Axiom S.2: By the revised Axiom S.2, since α is in W:sub:ζ, α ∈ L.

Revised Axiom W.1: By the revised Axiom W.1, since α ∈ L, l(α) ≠ 0.

Definition of Length: By Definition 1.1.2, the length of a string is the number of non-empty characters it contains.

Implication: Since l(α) ≠ 0 (from Step 4), α must contain at least one non-empty character.

Uniqueness: By Theorem 3.2.6, since α ∈ L and l(α) ≠ 0, α is unique.

Conclusion: Since ⲁ:sub:i is part of α, and α contains no empty characters, it follows that ⲁ:sub:i ≠ ε.

Since ζ and i were arbitrary, we can generalize:

∀ ζ ∈ C:sub:L : ∀ i ∈ N:sub:l(ζ): ( (i, ⲁ:sub:i) ∈  Ζ ) → ⲁ:sub:i ≠ ε

This completes the proof. ∎

New Proof of Theorem about Words (using the new Axiom W.1):

Theorem: ∀ α ∈ L : ∀ i ∈ N:sub:l(α): ( (i, ⲁ:sub:i) ∈  Α ) → ( ⲁ:sub:i ⊂:sub:s α)

Proof:

Let α be an arbitrary word in L, and let i be a natural number such that 1 ≤ i ≤ l(α).

Assumption: Assume that (i, ⲁ:sub:i) ∈ A.

Revised Axiom W.1: By the revised Axiom W.1, since α ∈ L, l(α) ≠ 0 and thus contains at least one non-empty character.

Consider the string: Consider the string s consisting of the single character ⲁ:sub:i.

Length of s: Since ⲁ:sub:i is non-empty by Axiom W.1, l(s) = 1.

Define a function: Define a function f: {1} → {i} such that f(1) = i. This function is strictly increasing and consecutive.

Definition of Containment: By Definition 1.1.4, since there exists a strictly increasing and consecutive function f from the indices of s to the indices of α, and since the character at position 1 in s is the same as the character at position i in α (both are ⲁ:sub:i), we can conclude that s is contained in α.

Conclusion: Therefore, ⲁ:sub:i ⊂:sub:s α.

Since α and i were arbitrary, we can generalize:

∀ α ∈ L : ∀ i ∈ N:sub:l(α): ( (i, ⲁ:sub:i) ∈  Α ) → ( ⲁ:sub:i ⊂:sub:s α)

This completes the proof. ∎

Conclusion:

Modifying Axiom W.1 to use l(α) ≠ 0 is a great idea! It simplifies the system, makes the proofs more elegant, and emphasizes the foundational role of length.  The new lemma about concatenating with the empty string is also a useful addition.

I believe these changes make our formal system even stronger and more consistent.  What shall we work on next?







You're right, "phoneme" might not be the most accurate term if we're not focusing on pronunciation. "Primitive" or perhaps "underlying unit" or "base unit" might be better terms to describe the concept you're envisioning.

I understand your goal now: you want to introduce a level beneath characters where distinct characters can be mapped to the same underlying unit, allowing you to capture equivalencies like case (e.g., 'a' and 'A' mapping to the same primitive) without altering the existing structure of strings, words, and sentences.

This is a very interesting idea, and I think it's achievable with careful definitions. Here's a way to formalize it, along with an analysis of its implications:

Formalizing "Primitives":

Set of Primitives (Π):  We introduce a new set Π (Pi) representing the set of all primitives.

Mapping Function (μ): We define a function μ: Σ → Π that maps each character in the alphabet Σ to a primitive in Π.

This function would encapsulate the relationships you want to capture, such as case equivalence. For example:
μ('a') = p
μ('A') = p
μ('b') = q
μ('B') = q
...and so on, where p, q, ... are elements of Π.
Character Equality (Revised): We redefine character equality based on the mapping function:

Definition 1.1.6: Character Equality (Revised)
Two characters ⲁ and ⲃ in Σ are equal (ⲁ = ⲃ) if and only if their corresponding primitives are equal: μ(ⲁ) = μ(ⲃ).
Implications:

Character-Level Operations: Operations like string length l(s) would remain unchanged, as they still operate on the sequence of characters.
String Equality: String equality would be indirectly affected, as it relies on character equality. Two strings would now be equal if their corresponding characters map to the same primitives.
Inversion: Inversion would likely remain unchanged, as it operates on the order of characters.
σ-reduction: σ-reduction would also likely remain unchanged, as it depends on the delimiter character, which would presumably map to a unique primitive.
Higher-Level Structures: Words, sentences, and palindromes would retain their overall definitions, but their properties might be affected by the new definition of character equality.
Theorems: Many of our existing theorems would likely remain valid, but some might need slight adjustments or reinterpretation in light of the new character equality. For example, theorems involving reflective words might need to consider whether "reflective" now refers to the primitives or the characters themselves.
Advantages of this Approach:

Flexibility: This approach allows you to define various equivalence relationships between characters without fundamentally altering the structure of the system.
Extensibility: You could introduce other mappings to capture other relationships beyond case (e.g., different representations of the same punctuation mark, accented characters, etc.).
Abstraction: It abstracts away from the specific character representation and focuses on a more fundamental level of "meaning" or "identity."
Challenges:

Careful Definition of μ: The mapping function μ needs to be carefully defined to accurately capture the desired relationships and avoid unintended consequences.
Reconciling with Existing Theorems: We would need to carefully examine all existing theorems to see if they remain valid or need modification under this new definition of character equality.
Potential for Complexity: While the basic idea is simple, the details of how this affects various parts of the system could become complex.
Conclusion:

Introducing a level of "primitives" beneath characters and defining character equality based on a mapping function is a powerful and flexible approach. It allows you to model equivalencies like case without disrupting the overall structure of your system. However, it requires careful consideration of how this new level interacts with existing definitions, axioms, and theorems.

Next Steps:

Formalize the Mapping: Write a formal definition for the set of primitives Π and the mapping function μ.
Revise Character Equality: Formally incorporate the new definition of character equality (Definition 1.1.6).
Analyze Impact: Carefully analyze the impact of this change on all existing definitions, axioms, and theorems, particularly those involving character equality, string equality, and containment.
Case-Insensitive Palindromes: Explore how this new framework allows you to define and analyze case-insensitive palindromes.
I'm very excited to see how this new level of abstraction enhances your formal system! This is a significant development, and I'm ready to assist you in working through the details. What do you want to focus on first?
