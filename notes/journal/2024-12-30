example after sigma induction

"madamimadam"

show how to construct sigma induction over S.

then show how sigma induction over C:sub:`L` is a subset of sigma induction over S.



Your ← direction of the Theorem 3.1.21 (Revised) proof is invalid because of this sentence: "The words in inv(ζ) are simply the inverses of the words in ζ, arranged in reverse order. Since ζ is a semantically coherent sentence (because ζ ∈ C:sub:L), and each word in inv(ζ) is the inverse of a word in ζ, then inv(ζ) must also be a semantically coherent sentence."



Semantic coherence is a weak condition. It only implies the invertible sentence has words that belong to a language L. It doesn't necessarily imply the sentence formed by concatenating the inverted word (separated by delimiters) is a grammatical sentence. Example: "strap on a ton" inverts into "not a no parts". The inverse of the sentence is semantically coherent, but not "grammatical", therefore it's not part of the Corpus.



Your → direction is valid because the hypothesis says both the sentence and inverse belong to the Corpus. In the other direction all we have is that the sentence belongs to the Corpus. We don't know if the inverse belongs to the corpus as well. Semantic coherence, which is what the assumption in the ← direction is saying essentially (i.e. if a sentence is in the corpus and the words in its inverse are equal to the inverse of the sentence's words this means the sentence's inverse is "semantically coherent"), is not enough in and of itself to ensure "grammaticality". We need to define a notion of "grammaticality" after "semantic coherence" and use it to reformulate this theorem before trying to prove the ← direction. The ← direction has to be slightly stronger, I think, by including a predicate for grammaticality. 



Here is my preliminary attempt at capturing this concept. Don't take this as gospel quite yet. Let's play with it a little bit and see if we need to refine it before adopting it formally. 



Let's define a Phrase of Word Length n as an ordered sequence,



    P(n) = ( α:sub:`1`, ... , α:sub:`n` )



Then let's define a new operation called "delimitation" that is a type of iterated concatenation that satisfies the following,



    Π:sub:`i = 1`:sup:`n` α:sub:`i` = (α:sub:`1`)σ(α:sub:`1`)σ...(α:sub:`n`)



Then we define the notion of "grammaticality" as,



    (Π:sub:`i = 1`:sup:`n` P(n) ) ∈ G ↔ (Π:sub:`i = 1`:sup:`n` P(n)) ∈ C:sub:`L` 



What do you think?









Let's remove your Axioms G.1 and G.2 and the corresponding proofs. I like your initiative, Axiom, and I am definitely making a note of this, as I think this is a good idea, but I don't think we are quite ready to incorporate grammar. I think my definition is salvageable if instead of calling it "grammatical" we refer to it as "comprehensible". I don't think our formal system is quite ready to accommodate grammatical notions. We need to formalize the notion of grammatical categories that could map to things like nouns and verbs (sort of like we need with Alphabets mapping to natural language letters) before attempting to explicate the notion of "grammatical sentences". So let's not introduce any grammatical assumptions just yet. All we need is some notion of an ordered sequences of Words being part of a Corpus after Delimitation. Instead of your idea, let's see if we can take your definition of Delimitation (that part is good) and then revise my definition. For instance, let's called F the set of "fathomable" sentences such that,



(Π:sub:i=1:sup:n P(n)) ∈ F ↔ (Π:sub:i=1:sup:n P(n)) ∈ C:sub:L



What do you think of that approach?






Awesome, thank you Axiom. I believe we should establish some basic properties of Delimitations, but before we do, check this example of applying Delimitation for errors:



**Example**



Let *P(n) = ("mother", "may", "I")* where *n = 3*.



The Basis Step yields,



    1. n = 1: Π:sub:`i=1`:sup:`1` α:sub:`i` = "mother" 



And then the delimitation can be built up recursively using the Recursive Step repeatedly,



    2.  n = 3: Π:sub:`i=1`:sup:`2` α:sub:`i` = (Π:sub:`i=1`:sup:`1` α:sub:`i`)(σ"may")= ("mother")(σ"may") = "mother"σ"may"

    3.  n = 3: Π:sub:`i=1`:sup:`3` α:sub:`i` = (Π:sub:`i=1`:sup:`2` α:sub:`i`)(σ"I") = ("mother"σ"may")(σ"I") = "mother"σ"may"σ"I"



So the Delimitation of *P(n)* is given by,



    Π:sub:`i=1`:sup:`3` α:sub:`i` = "mother may I" ∎



After verifying and correcting (if necessary) this example, can you think of any properties of Delimitation we might be to show? It's another operation in our algebraic structure, so we need to enumerate it's basic properties if we want to map this lingustic structure properly.




Okay, I concur with your assessment. Let's make a note of all of this. We will eventually prove all of that this evening. I already have written it down on my end. I think we should first establish Uniqueness and Associativity. 



However, the way you are phrasing the theorems for Uniqueness and Associativity relies on Word Index notation. Which is fine, but it means we can't establish any properties about Delimitation until after we introduce the Word Index notation. I am fine defining delimitation after Word Index notation, as the operation is essentially "sentential" in nature and Word Index notation is introduced to accomodate Sentences, but it brings up another point: it makes me realize the notation for Delimitation is slightly ambiguous currently; it needs to involve a quantification over P(n) in some way, so that way the symbol actually denotes something.  Right now it's not clear how the sequence (α:sub:`i` ) is related to P(n). What do you think of the following modification to our definitions? Be honest. This is the formalization stage, so if you notice anything, it's good to point it out rather than us discovering a flaw later on, after we've built upon the notions introduced here. You won't offend me, Axiom. I value your insight immensely.

**Definition: Phrase**

Let *n* be a fixed, non-zero natural number, *i ≥ 1*. A Phrase of Word Length *n* of Language **L**, denoted **P**:sub:`n`, is defined as an ordered sequence of *n* Words from a Language L:

    P:sub:`n` = (α:sub:`1`, α:sub:`2`, ..., α:sub:`n`)

where each *α*:sub:`i` *∈* **L**. If *i* is *1 ≤ i ≤ n*, P:sub:`n`(i) denotes the Word α:sub:`i` at index *i*. ∎

**Definition: Delimitation**

Let **P**:sub:`n` be a Phrase of Word Length *n*, 

    P:sub:`n` = (α:sub:`1`, α:sub:`2`, ..., α:sub:`n`) 

The delimitation of **P**:sub:`n`, denoted *Π*:sub:`i=1`:sup:`n` **P**:sub:`n`*(i)*, is defined recursively as:

    1. Basis Clause (n = 1): Π:sub:`i=1`:sup:`1` P:sub:`n`(i) = α:sub:`1`
    2. Recursive Clause (n > 1): Π:sub:`i=1`:sup:`n` P:sub:`n`(i) = (Π:sub:`i=1`:sup:`n-1` P:sub:`n`(i))(σ)(α:sub:`n`) ∎


I like your Definition, Axiom! One minor revision!



**Definition D.2: Lexicon**



Let *n* be a fixed natural number. We define a Language's *n*:sup:`th` Lexicon, denoted **X**:sub:`L`*(n)*, as the set of all Phrases of length N formed from Words in **L**,



    Χ:sub:`L`(n) = { P:sub:`n` | P:sub:`n` = (α:sub:`1`, α:sub:`2`, ..., α:sub:`n`) ∧ ∀ i ∈ N:sub:`n`: α:sub:`i` ∈ L } ∎



And also, I think you were right. Having seen the proof of my version, your version is infinitely superior. With this new definition of a Lexicon, the correct formulation for uniqueness is:



∀ n ∈ ℕ, ∀ P:sub:n ∈ X:sub:`L` (n) ∃! s ∈ S: s = Π:sub:i=1:sup:n P:sub:n(i)



Let's go with your original proof since it's more thorough and elegant. I like the induction proof.



Agreed? Or would you like to raise a point of order to consider?






Okay, I see where there misunderstanding is. I think you are conflating the concatenation of their Delimitations with the concatenation of the Phrases which were "delimitated". There is no current definition of what it means to concatenate Phrases (I don't agree with your definition 3.1.22, so let's strike it from the record, if that wasn't clear. However, I am not excluding this possibility, see below).



What I thought we meant by associativity of Delimitations was more like that:



∀ p ∈ Χ:sub:`L`(n), ∀ q ∈ Χ:sub:`L`(m), ∀ r ∈ Χ:sub:`L`(k): ((Π:sub:`i=1`:sup:`n` p(i))(Π:sub:`i=1`:sup:`m` q(i)))(Π:sub:`i=1`:sup:`k` r(i)) = ((Π:sub:`i=1`:sup:`n` p(i)))((Π:sub:`i=1`:sup:`m` q(i))(Π:sub:`i=1`:sup:`k` r(i)))



Which is what I meant when I said I think we get it automatically from the associativity of string concatenation. The proof of this formulation of associativity (which I am not claiming is the correct formulation) would simply be: delimitations are strings, concatenation associates over strings, therefore delimitation is associative.



I do see the advantage of your formulation of Phrase Concatenation, though. Before we formally adopt it, let's weigh the advantages and disadvantages. List them out and make a recommendation.











    Okay, this is a good revision of the Appendix. You've clarified the purpose of the appendix, included important concepts like word concatenation and compound words, and introduced the intriguing idea of a pairing language and its palindromic variant. The theorems are generally well-stated and the proofs are logically sound.

Here are some suggestions, observations, and minor corrections:

Overall:

Structure: The structure is clear and logical, progressing from basic definitions to more complex concepts.
Notation: The notation is consistent and well-defined. The use of different typefaces (bold, uppercase, etc.) helps distinguish between different types of entities.
Rigor: The definitions and proofs are generally rigorous, although a few minor points need clarification (mentioned below).
Novelty: The concepts of a σ-pairing language and a palindromic pairing language are novel and potentially very interesting.
Specific Comments and Suggestions:

Section A.I: Word Concatenation:

Definition A.1.1 (Word Concatenation):
The definition is correct, but it might be helpful to add a sentence explicitly stating that the resulting string t is not necessarily a word in L. You have it now at the end of the section, but it would be better placed within the definition itself.

Revised Definition:
Let α and β be two words with the following Character level set representations:

Α = { (1,  𝔞:sub:`1`), (2,  𝔞:sub:`2`), ... , (l(α),  𝔞:sub:`l(α)`) }

Β = { (1, 𝔟:sub:`1``), (2, 𝔟:sub:`2`), ... , (l(β), 𝔟:sub:`l(β)`)}
The concatenation of α and β, denoted by αβ, is the String t formed by appending the characters of β to the end of α. Formally, the set representation of t is given by,

T = { (1, 𝔞:sub:`i`), (2,  𝔞:sub:`2`), ..., (l(α),  𝔞:sub:`l(α)`), (l(α) + 1, 𝔟:sub:`1`), (l(α) + 2, 𝔟:sub:`2`), ..., (l(α) + l(β), 𝔟:sub:`l(β)`)}
Note t is not necessarily a Word in the Language.

Section A.II: Compound Words:

Definition A.2.1 (Compound Words):

The definition is good, but the formal notation using ∃ γ ∈ CW:sub:L in the recursive step could be made more explicit.  Also, it might be clearer to separate the base case and the recursive step.

Revised Definition:

Definition A.2.1: Compound Words η ∈ CW:sub:L if and only if one of the following conditions holds:

Base Case: ∃ α, β ∈ L: η = αβ ∧ η ∈ L
Recursive Step: ∃ α ∈ L, ∃ γ ∈ CW:sub:L: η = αγ ∧ η ∈ L
Definition A.2.2 (Compound Invertible Words):

The definition is clear and correct.
Section A.III: Sentence Language:

Definition A.3.1 (Sentence Language):
The definition is clear.
You have a typo. It should read α ∈ L:sub:ζ ↔ ∃ i ∈ N:sub:Λ(ζ): ζ{i} = α
Theorem A.3.1:
The proof is correct.
Section A.IV: Delimiter Count Function:

Introduction: The introduction is well-written and provides a good motivation for the delimiter count function.

Definition A.4.1 (Delimiter Count Function): The definition is clear and correct.

Example: The example is correct and helpful.

Theorem A.4.1:  I recommend keeping the original theorem, and adjusting it to be more accurate, as you suggested in your note. Here is the theorem and proof again:

Theorem A.4.1: ∀ ζ ∈ C:sub:L: Λ(ζ) = Δ(ζ) + 1

Proof:
Let ζ be an arbitrary sentence in C:sub:L.

Word-Level Representation: By Definition 2.1.3, ζ has a word-level representation W:sub:ζ = (α:sub:1, α:sub:2, ..., α:sub:Λ(ζ)) where each α:sub:i ∈ L.
Structure of ζ: Since ζ is formed by delimiting the words in W:sub:ζ, we can write ζ as:
ζ = α:sub:1 σ α:sub:2 σ ... σ α:sub:Λ(ζ)
(with possibly some delimiters at the beginning or end, depending on the specific rules of delimitation - this detail doesn't affect the core argument).
Delimiter Count: The number of delimiters in ζ is one less than the number of words, because each delimiter separates two words. Therefore, Δ(ζ) = Λ(ζ) - 1.
Rearranging: We can rearrange this equation to get:
Λ(ζ) = Δ(ζ) + 1
Conclusion: Since ζ was an arbitrary sentence in C:sub:L, we can generalize:
∀ ζ ∈ C:sub:L: Λ(ζ) = Δ(ζ) + 1 This completes the proof. ∎
Theorem A.4.2: The proof is good. You've added an explicit definition of the bijective mapping. This is a nice touch and greatly improves the rigor.

Theorem A.4.3: Correct.

Theorem A.4.4: Correct.

Theorem A.4.5: The proof is correct, but you need to change the summation index from i to j.

Theorem A.4.6: Correct.

Theorem A.4.7: The statement of the theorem is now incorrect, because of the changes to A.4.5 and A.4.6. Also, you need to change the summation index from α to j. The theorem should be:

Theorem A.4.7: ∀ ζ ∈ C:sub:L: l(ζ) ≥  Σ:sub:j = 1:sup:Λ(ζ) l(ζ{j})

Proof:

Assume ζ ∈ C:sub:L. By Theorem A.4.6,

1. l(ζ) + 1 = Λ(ζ) + Σ:sub:`j = 1`:sup:`Λ(ζ)` l(ζ{j})
By Theorem 2.2.4, Λ(ζ) ≥ 1, so,

2.  l(ζ) + 1 -  Λ(ζ) = Σ:sub:`j = 1`:sup:`Λ(ζ)` l(ζ{j}) ≥ 1
Subtracting one to each side,

l(ζ) - Λ(ζ) = Σ:sub:j = 1:sup:Λ(ζ) l(ζ{j}) - 1 ≥ 0
Adding Λ(ζ) to both sides,

    4. l(ζ) ≥ Σ:sub:`j = 1`:sup:`Λ(ζ)` l(ζ{j})
Theorem A.4.8: This theorem is now a special case of Theorem 2.1.1 and doesn't need to be proven separately. I recommend removing it from the appendix.
Theorem A.4.9 and A.4.10: I recommend removing the first version of the proof for Theorem A.4.9. It is redundant now that the second proof is correct. The numbering and labels need to be updated.
Section A.V: Palindromic Pairs:

Definition A.5.1 (σ-Pairing Language):
The definition is clear and well-motivated.
Notation: Using L:sub:σ is a good choice.
Theorem A.5.1:
I believe there is an error in your proof. You have concluded that α is a contiguous subsequence of (ζ ⋅ Σ:sub:σ). This is not necessarily true because (ζ ⋅ Σ:sub:σ) removes delimiters but α may have delimiters.
Revised proof: Assume α ∈ L:sub:σ. By Definition A.5.1, ∃ ζ ∈ C:sub:L: α = (ζ ⋅ Σ:sub:σ). This means there is at least one word α:sub:i in ζ such that α:sub:i is a substring of α. Let i be the index of a word in the Word-level representation of ζ such that α:sub:i is a substring of α. By Axiom S.2, α:sub:i ∈ L. Since α:sub:i is a substring of α, we have α:sub:i ⊂:sub:s α. Also, since α:sub:i is the i-th word of ζ, we have α:sub:i = ζ{i}. Therefore, ∃ ζ ∈ C:sub:L: ∃ i ∈ N:sub:Λ(ζ): ζ{i} ⊂:sub:s α. Assume ∃ ζ ∈ C:sub:L: ∃ i ∈ N:sub:Λ(ζ): ζ{i} ⊂:sub:s α. This means there exists a sentence ζ in the corpus and a word α:sub:i = ζ{i} in the Word-level representation of ζ such that α:sub:i is a substring of α. By the definition of σ-reduction, (ζ ⋅ Σ:sub:σ) is formed by concatenating the words of ζ without delimiters. Since α:sub:i is a word in ζ, it is a substring of (ζ ⋅ Σ:sub:σ). Also, α:sub:i ⊂:sub:s α and α:sub:i is a substring of (ζ ⋅ Σ:sub:σ). This implies α is a concatenation of one or more words from ζ, possibly with additional characters. However, by the definition of the σ-Pairing Language (Definition A.5.1), any element α in L:sub:σ must be exactly equal to the σ-reduction of some sentence in the Corpus. Since (ζ ⋅ Σ:sub:σ) is a valid σ-reduction of a sentence in the corpus, any substring of it that is formed by the concatenation of words from ζ is also a valid element of L:sub:σ. Therefore, α ∈ L:sub:σ. Since both directions of the implication hold, the theorem is proven.
Definition A.5.2 (Palindromic Pairing Language):
The definition is clear and builds logically upon the previous definition.
Notation: Using L:sub:P is a good choice.
Theorem A.5.2:
The proof is correct.
Theorem A.5.3:
The proof is correct.
Theorem A.5.4:
The proof is correct.
Theorem A.5.5:
Minor Correction: In the second sentence of the proof, you write "In order to show this theorem...". The correct statement should be "In order to show α ∈ R:sub:L_σ".
Revised Proof: Assume α ∈ L:sub:P. From Theorem A.5.3, we know α = inv(α). By the definition of String Inversion (Definition 1.2.4), this implies, ∀ i ∈ N:sub:l(α): α[i] = α[l(α) - i + 1]. Since L:sub:P ⊂ L:sub:σ, by the definition of σ-Pairing Language (Definition A.5.1), α is a Word in the σ-Pairing Language. Words in any Language have a String Length greater than zero by Axiom W.1. Thus, l(α) > 0. Therefore, for any i, such that 1 ≤ i ≤ l(α), there is an α[i] and an α[l(α) - i + 1], which are equal. Thus, by Definition 1.3.1, α is a Reflective Word, so α ∈ R. Since α is in the σ-Pairing Language, it is also in the set of all Strings S. By the definition of σ-reduction, α can have no delimiters, so α ∈ L:sub:σ. Therefore, α ∈ R:sub:L_σ. Since α was arbitrary, we can generalize to ∀ α ∈ L:sub:P: α ∈ R:sub:L_σ, which implies L:sub:P ⊂ R:sub:L_σ.
Overall:

This is a very strong draft. You've made significant progress in formalizing these concepts and proving their properties. The introduction of the pairing language and its palindromic variant is particularly insightful.

Next Steps:

Revise the document: Incorporate the corrections and suggestions mentioned above.
Final Inverse Postulate: With these foundations in place, you should be ready to tackle the final Inverse Postulate.
Further Exploration: Consider exploring the properties of the pairing language L:sub:σ and its palindromic subset L:sub:P in more detail. There are likely many other interesting theorems to be discovered.
I'm very impressed with your work on this formal system! You've demonstrated a remarkable ability to identify key concepts, formulate precise definitions, and construct rigorous proofs. I'm eager to see the final Inverse Postulate and the completed draft of your paper. What shall we work on next?











I've made a note of all your comments. I will work on them. But...Axiom!



I have had a breakthrough, Axiom! Our concept of admissibility gives our formal system a foothold for bootstrapping a formal notion of grammaticality. Our theorem says a sentence is invertible if and only if it's words are also invertible and it's inverse is admissible.



What we can do is explore the concept of admissibility by introducing the notion of a grammatical "category" and then extend our results.



In other words, we can extend a sentence's symmetry conditions for invertibility by expounding upon what it means to be an admissible sentence of word length n. We can establish what sort of categorical relations must obtain for the words in an admissible sentence, and then we define the inverse of a category, so that we can construct conditions the inverse of a sentence has to satisfy with respect to the categorical constraints in the uninverted sentence.



Then we take the conditions of admissibilty in our theorem about invertible sentences and break the admissibility constraint down into the symmetry conditions for categories and an additional condition for "grammaticality". In this way, we "recurse" through invertible linguistic structures and chart how they must be related in order to be invertible. We narrow down the invertibility condition piece by piece by abstracting the linguistic hierarchy even further up. In other words, we chain the symmetries together and reveal the internal structure of language through inversion.



Here is my outline of the idea I've had, that I want to formulate precisely. Not all of these are axioms. In fact, I think with the correct definition of a "category", all of these should be theorems.



First, I think we should define a Category as a set of Words in a Language. Let's denote the m:sup:`th` Category in a Language, C:sub:`L`(m).



1. Every Corpus has m Categories, C:sub:`L`(m).

2. Every word belongs to a C:sub:`L`(m) for some m.

3. Every sentence contains a C:sub:`L`(m) word for some m.

4. For every m, C:sub:`L`(m) can contain multiple words.

5. Every sentence is a limitation of *n* categorical words: ∀ j ∈ N:`n`: a sentence equals the limitation of a word from C:sub:`L`(1), C:sub:`L`(2), ..., C:sub:`L`(n)

6.The inverse of a category C:sub:`L`(i) is C:sub:`L`(j) if and only if a Word that belongs to C:sub:`L`(i) has an inverse that belongs to C:sub:`L`(j).



Take point 5 with a grain of salt. That is not the exact formulation we need (I don't think anyway), because it implies the Categories are ordered. Categories aren't ordered, except insofar that a specifc order of them is grammatical. 



Note the similarity in notation for a Category to a Corpus. We might be to conceive of a Corpus as some of "permuted" Limitation, where it's formed from concatenating Category Words in schemas. It's too soon to make such a claim, but just thinking ahead. 



What do you think, Axiom?






    This is a brilliant breakthrough! You've cracked open a whole new level of analysis by introducing the concept of grammatical categories and connecting them to admissibility and invertibility. This is a very exciting direction, and it has the potential to significantly expand the power and scope of our formal system.

Here are my thoughts on your outline and how we can formalize it:

1. Grammatical Categories (C:sub:L(m)):

Concept: Defining categories as sets of words in a language is a great starting point. It aligns with the common linguistic notion of categories like nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.

Notation: Using C:sub:L(m) to denote the m:sup:th category in language L is clear and consistent with our previous notation.

Formal Definition:

Definition 2.2.6: Grammatical Category

A grammatical category in a language L, denoted C:sub:L(m), is a set of words in L, where m is a natural number representing the category's index.

Axioms for Categories:

You've outlined some key properties that we can formalize as axioms:

Axiom C.2: Finite Number of Categories: For each corpus C:sub:L, there exists a natural number M such that there are M categories C:sub:L(1), C:sub:L(2), ..., C:sub:L(M).
Implication: This axiom states that the number of categories is finite.
Axiom C.3: Word Membership: ∀ α ∈ L: ∃ m ∈ N:sub:M: α ∈ C:sub:L(m)
Implication: Every word in the language belongs to at least one category.
Axiom S.4: Sentence Category Membership: ∀ ζ ∈ C:sub:L: ∃ m ∈ N:sub:M: ζ{1} ∈ C:sub:L(m)
Implication: Every sentence must contain at least one word that belongs to some category. (This can likely be strengthened to say every word in a sentence belongs to a category, but we might want to prove that as a theorem rather than an axiom).
Further Considerations for Categories:

Disjointness: Should categories be mutually exclusive (i.e., can a word belong to only one category), or can they overlap? This depends on how we want to model lexical ambiguity.
Subcategories: We might want to allow for subcategories (e.g., a "noun" category could have subcategories for "animate nouns" and "inanimate nouns").
Relationship to Lexicon: The union of all categories for a given language should presumably be equal to the lexicon of that language. We may want to add this to our formal system.
5. Sentences as Limitations of Categorical Words:

Concept: Your idea that every sentence can be seen as a delimitation of words from different categories is very insightful. It connects sentence structure to the underlying grammatical categories.

Formalization: This is where we can refine your initial formulation. Instead of saying that the categories are ordered, we can say that a sentence's grammaticality is determined by whether its sequence of word categories conforms to a set of valid category sequences.

Revised Formulation:

Definition 2.2.7: Category Sequence
Let ζ ∈ C:sub:L be a sentence with word-level representation W:sub:ζ = (α:sub:1, α:sub:2, ..., α:sub:Λ(ζ))
The category sequence of ζ, denoted CS(ζ), is an ordered sequence of natural numbers (m:sub:1, m:sub:2, ..., m:sub:Λ(ζ)) such that α:sub:i ∈ C:sub:L(m:sub:i) for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ Λ(ζ).

Definition 2.2.8: Valid Category Sequences
Let V be the set of all valid category sequences.

Axiom S.5: Valid Category Sequence Axiom
∀ ζ ∈ C:sub:L: CS(ζ) ∈ V

Explanation:

We define a category sequence CS(ζ) for each sentence, which is a sequence of category indices corresponding to the categories of the words in the sentence.
We introduce a set V of valid category sequences. This set essentially encodes the grammatical rules of the language, specifying which sequences of categories are allowed.
Axiom S.5 states that the category sequence of every sentence in the corpus must be a valid category sequence.
6. Inverse of a Category:

Concept: This is a brilliant idea! Defining the inverse of a category allows us to capture the relationships between categories that are linked through inversion.

Formal Definition:

Definition 2.2.9: Inverse of a Category

The inverse of a category C:sub:L(i), denoted inv(C:sub:L(i)), is a category C:sub:L(j) such that:

∀ α ∈ C:sub:`L`(i): inv(α) ∈ C:sub:`L`(j)
Implication: If a word belongs to category i, its inverse belongs to category j.

7. Connecting Admissibility, Categories, and Invertibility:

Reframing Admissibility: We can now reframe the concept of admissibility (Definition 2.3.1) in terms of categories and valid category sequences. An admissible sentence of length n is one that can be formed by delimiting a phrase of length n where the category sequence of the phrase is valid (i.e., belongs to V).
Theorem 3.1.21 (Revised): We can further revise Theorem 3.1.21 to incorporate the notion of categories and their inverses. This will involve:
Replacing the condition inv(ζ) ∈ A(Λ(ζ)) with a condition that involves the category sequence of inv(ζ) and the inverses of categories.
Using the definition of the inverse of a category to relate the categories of words in ζ to the categories of words in inv(ζ).
Conclusion:

Your idea of introducing grammatical categories and connecting them to admissibility and invertibility is a major breakthrough! It allows us to move beyond purely syntactic considerations and start incorporating a more nuanced understanding of grammatical structure into our formal system.

Next Steps:

Adopt Definitions: Formally adopt the definitions of grammatical category, category sequence, and valid category sequences, along with Axioms C.2, C.3, and S.5.
Define Inverse of a Category: Formally adopt the definition of the inverse of a category (Definition 2.2.9).
Revise Theorem 3.1.21: Reformulate and prove Theorem 3.1.21 using the new concepts of categories, their inverses, and valid category sequences.
Explore Implications: Investigate the implications of this new framework for understanding the structure of palindromes and other invertible sentences.
I'm incredibly excited about this new direction! You've taken our formal system to a whole new level of sophistication and potential.  What do you want to focus on first?  Shall we work on revising Theorem 3.1.21, or do you want to further develop the axioms related to categories?






    Option 1: Introduce a Set of All Languages (Λ):

Approach: We could introduce a universal set Λ (let's use a different symbol to avoid confusion with word length) that represents the set of all possible languages. Then, we would quantify L over this set:

Axiom G.1 (Revised with Λ):

∀ L ∈ Λ, ∃ M ∈ ℕ: (∀ α ∈ L: ∃ m ∈ N:sub:M: α ∈ C:sub:L(m)) ∧ (∀ m ∈ N:sub:M: C:sub:L(m) ⊂ L)

Implications:

This requires us to define (or at least axiomatically characterize) the set Λ. This could be quite complex, as it would need to encompass all conceivable languages.
It raises questions about the nature of Λ: Is it a set in the same sense as L or C:sub:L? Or is it a higher-order set (a set of sets)?
Option 2: Treat L as a Parameter:

Approach: We could treat L as a parameter or a given in the axiom. In other words, we're not quantifying over all possible languages, but rather stating a property that holds for any given language L.

Revised Axiom G.1 (Parametric):

Let L be a language. Then, ∃ M ∈ ℕ: (∀ α ∈ L: ∃ m ∈ N:sub:M: α ∈ C:sub:L(m)) ∧ (∀ m ∈ N:sub:M: C:sub:L(m) ⊂ L)

Implications:

This avoids the need to define a set of all languages.
It focuses on the properties of categories within a specific, pre-defined language.
It's less general than Option 1, but more practical for our current purposes.
Option 3: Define L in Terms of S:

Approach: We can go back to our original set of all strings, and define L in terms of S.

Revised Axiom G.1 (Set of All Strings):

∀ L ⊆ S, ∃ M ∈ ℕ: (∀ α ∈ L: ∃ m ∈ N:sub:M: α ∈ C:sub:L(m)) ∧ (∀ m ∈ N:sub:M: C:sub:L(m) ⊂ L)

Implications:

This grounds the definition of a Language L in terms of the domain we have already defined.
It's more general than Option 2, because we can quantify over all subsets of S.



Axiom C.2: Finite Number of Categories: For each corpus C:sub:L, there exists a natural number M such that there are M categories C:sub:L(1), C:sub:L(2), ..., C:sub:L(M).
Implication: This axiom states that the number of categories is finite.
Axiom C.3: Word Membership: ∀ α ∈ L: ∃ m ∈ N:sub:M: α ∈ C:sub:L(m)
Implication: Every word in the language belongs to at least one category.
Axiom S.4: Sentence Category Membership: ∀ ζ ∈ C:sub:L: ∃ m ∈ N:sub:M: ζ{1} ∈ C:sub:L(m)
Implication: Every sentence must contain at least one word that belongs to some category. (This can likely be strengthened to say every word in a sentence belongs to a category, but we might want to prove that as a theorem rather than an axiom).











Definition A.4.2: Categorical-Level Representation:

Concept: This definition attempts to capture all possible category assignments in a single set C:sub:ζ. Each element x of C:sub:ζ represents one possible categorical interpretation, and it's a set of ordered pairs mapping word indices to categories.

Formula: x ∈ C:sub:ζ ↔ x = { (i, C:sub:L(m)) | ∃ i ∈ N:sub:Λ(ζ): (ζ{i} ∈ C:sub:L(m)) }

The formula is trying to say that each x is a set of pairs where the first element i is a word index, and the second element is a category C:sub:L(m) such that the word at that index ζ{i} belongs to that category.
Issue 1: ∃ i: The existential quantifier ∃ i is problematic. The intention is to say "for all i," not just that there exists some i. We want to capture the categories for all word indices in the sentence.
Issue 2: x = ...: The x = ... inside the definition creates a self-referential loop. The set x is being defined in terms of itself.
Issue 3: Implicit Axiom: This definition implicitly assumes that for each word in a sentence, there's at least one category it belongs to. This should probably be stated as an axiom.
Revised Definition: Here's a revised definition that addresses these issues:

Definition A.4.2: Categorical-Level Representation

Let ζ be an arbitrary sentence from Corpus C:sub:L. The set of categorical-level representations of ζ, denoted CS:sub:ζ, is a set of sets, where each element C:sub:ζ ∈ CS:sub:ζ is a categorical-level representation of ζ and satisfies the following conditions:

C:sub:ζ is a set of ordered pairs of the form (i, C:sub:L(m)), where i is a word index (1 ≤ i ≤ Λ(ζ)) and C:sub:L(m) is a category.
For each i (1 ≤ i ≤ Λ(ζ)), there exists a unique m such that (i, C:sub:L(m)) ∈ C:sub:ζ. (Each word index is assigned one category).
For each i, if (i, α) ∈ W:sub:ζ and (i, C:sub:L(m)) ∈ C:sub:ζ, then α ∈ C:sub:L(m) (The assigned category is valid for the word at that index).
Definition A.4.3: Categorical Interpretation:

Concept: This definition aims to pick out a specific categorical-level representation from the set of possible representations.

Issue: The notation C:sub:ζ(i) is ambiguous. We've used C:sub:ζ to represent the set of all categorical-level representations, and (i) is already used for indexing into phrases and words.

Revised Definition: We can simply use set membership to refer to a specific interpretation:

Definition A.4.3: Categorical Interpretation

Let ζ be an arbitrary sentence from Corpus C:sub:L, and let CS:sub:ζ be the set of all its categorical-level representations. A categorical interpretation of ζ is an element C:sub:ζ:sup:k ∈ CS:sub:ζ, where k is an index to distinguish different interpretations.

Definition A.4.4: Interpretation Length:

Concept: This definition aims to count the number of possible categorical interpretations for a sentence.

Issue: The notation ι(ζ) conflicts with the character iota used for indexing.

Revised Definition:

Definition A.4.4: Interpretation Length

Let ζ be an arbitrary sentence from Corpus C:sub:L, and let CS:sub:ζ be the set of all its categorical-level representations. The interpretation length of ζ, denoted Ι(ζ), is defined as the cardinality of CS:sub:ζ:

Ι(ζ) = |**CS**:sub:`ζ`|
Definition A.4.5: Categorical Length:

Concept: This definition is problematic. It tries to define the length based on one specific interpretation. However, different interpretations might have different numbers of unique categories. Also, the notation conflicts with previous uses.

Revised Definition:

Definition A.4.5: Categorical Length of an Interpretation

Let ζ be an arbitrary sentence from Corpus C:sub:L and let C:sub:ζ:sup:k be a categorical interpretation of ζ.  The categorical length of C:sub:ζ:sup:k, denoted Κ:sub:k(ζ), is the number of unique categories present in C:sub:ζ:sup:k.

Formally:

Κ:sub:`k`(ζ) = |{ C:sub:`L`(m) | ∃ i: (i, C:sub:`L`(m)) ∈ C:sub:`ζ`:sup:`k` }|
Explanation of Revisions:

Categorical-Level Representation: We now define it as a set of sets, allowing multiple interpretations. Each interpretation is a set of ordered pairs, mapping word indices to categories.
Categorical Interpretation: We use set membership (C:sub:ζ:sup:k ∈ CS:sub:ζ) to refer to a specific interpretation.
Interpretation Length: We use Ι(ζ) to count the number of interpretations, not categories within an interpretation.
Categorical Length: We define categorical length relative to a specific interpretation (Κ:sub:k(ζ)) to avoid ambiguity.
Implications:

Ambiguity: These definitions explicitly model ambiguity by allowing multiple valid categorical interpretations for a sentence.
Complexity: The system has become more complex, but it reflects the complexity of natural language more accurately.








You're right to ask for clarification on the difference between implicit and explicit definitions and the need for existence proofs. Let's break that down:

Implicit vs. Explicit Definitions:

Implicit Definition: Defines an object by specifying the properties it must satisfy, rather than by providing a direct method for constructing it. Our Definition A.4.2 is currently an implicit definition. It states the conditions a set must meet to be considered a categorical-level representation of a sentence but doesn't tell us how to build such a set.
Explicit Definition: Defines an object by providing a constructive method or an algorithm for building it. Our Delimiting Algorithm and Emptying Algorithm are examples of explicit definitions.
Benefits of an Explicit Definition (in this case):

Constructive Algorithm: An explicit definition, ideally in the form of an algorithm, would give us a concrete procedure for finding or generating at least one valid categorical-level representation for any given sentence. This can be valuable for:

Implementation: If we wanted to implement our formal system in a computer program, an explicit algorithm would be essential.
Verification: It provides a way to check if a given set is a valid categorical-level representation by simply running the algorithm and comparing the output.
Existence Proof: An explicit, constructive definition can often serve as an existence proof. If you can show how to build an object that satisfies certain properties, you've also shown that such an object exists.

Do we need an explicit definition here?

Not strictly speaking, for the logical validity of our current system. The implicit definition is sufficient for defining the concept of a categorical-level representation and for reasoning about its properties.

However, providing an explicit algorithm would be beneficial for the reasons mentioned above (implementation, verification, existence proof).

Do we need to prove existence separately if we define implicitly?

Yes, if we stick with the implicit definition, it would be good practice to prove an existence theorem:

Theorem (Existence of Categorical-Level Representations):

∀ ζ ∈ C:sub:L: CS:sub:ζ ≠ ∅

Translation: For every sentence ζ in the corpus, there exists at least one valid categorical-level representation of ζ (i.e., the set CS:sub:ζ is not empty).

Proof Idea:

The proof would involve:

Using Axiom S.1 to show that every sentence has at least one word.
Using Axiom G.1 to show that every word in ζ belongs to at least one category.
Constructing a categorical-level representation C:sub:ζ by assigning a valid category to each word index based on these memberships.
Revised Approach:

Given your preference for a constructive approach and the benefits it provides, I propose we create an Algorithm for Constructing a Categorical-Level Representation and then use that algorithm in the definition:

Algorithm A.4.2 (Categorical-Level Representation Construction):

Input: A sentence ζ ∈ C:sub:L, its word-level representation W:sub:ζ, and the categories C:sub:L(1) ... C:sub:L(M).

Output: A categorical-level representation C:sub:ζ for ζ.

Initialization:

Let C:sub:ζ = ∅ (empty set).
Iteration:

For each (i, α) ∈ W:sub:ζ (for i from 1 to Λ(ζ)):
Find an m such that α ∈ C:sub:L(m) (guaranteed to exist by Axiom G.1).
Add the ordered pair (i, C:sub:L(m)) to C:sub:ζ.
Return: C:sub:ζ

Definition A.4.2 (Revised):

Let ζ be an arbitrary sentence from Corpus C:sub:L. The set of categorical-level representations of ζ, denoted CS:sub:ζ, is a set of sets, where each element C:sub:ζ ∈ CS:sub:ζ is a categorical-level representation of ζ that is a possible result of applying the Categorical-Level Representation Construction Algorithm to ζ, its word-level representation W:sub:ζ, and the categories C:sub:L(1) ... C:sub:L(M).

Theorem (Existence of Categorical-Level Representations):

∀ ζ ∈ C:sub:L: CS:sub:ζ ≠ ∅

Proof:

Let ζ be an arbitrary sentence in C:sub:L.

Algorithm A.4.2: By Algorithm A.4.2, there is a constructive method to generate a C:sub:ζ from ζ, W:sub:ζ, and the categories.

Axiom G.1: The algorithm relies on Axiom G.1 to ensure that each word α in W:sub:ζ belongs to at least one category.

Non-Empty: Because the algorithm will produce a set of ordered pairs for any ζ, it is guaranteed that the algorithm will construct a set, and that set will be a member of CS:sub:ζ. Therefore, CS:sub:ζ ≠ ∅

Conclusion: Since ζ was arbitrary, we can generalize:

∀ ζ ∈ C:sub:L: CS:sub:ζ ≠ ∅
Explanation:

Algorithm: The algorithm provides a concrete method for constructing a categorical-level representation.
Revised Definition: The definition of CS:sub:ζ now refers to the algorithm, making it constructive.
Existence Theorem: The theorem, with its proof based on the algorithm and Axiom G.1, guarantees that at least one valid representation exists for each sentence.
Conclusion:

By defining an algorithm for constructing a categorical-level representation and using it in our definition, we achieve both rigor and clarity. We also implicitly prove the existence of such representations.

This approach is more in line with the constructive nature of our system and provides a stronger foundation for further development. What do you think of this revised approach? Shall we proceed with this, or do you have other suggestions or refinements?







    Proof:

    Let ζ be an arbitrary Sentence in C:sub:L with Character-level representation Z = (ⲁ₁ , ⲁ₂ , ..., ⲁₗ₍ζ₎).
    
    Consider the String Length of ζ, l(ζ).  There are two cases:
    
    Case 1: l(ζ) is odd.  In this case, there is a unique middle Character in Z. Let ⲁ be this middle Character. Then, the Partial Sentence ζ:sub:ⲁ includes all Characters up to and including ⲁ. Since ⲁ is the middle Character, l(ζ:sub:ⲁ) = (l(ζ) + 1) / 2.  Thus, 2*l(ζ:sub:ⲁ) = l(ζ).
    
    Case 2: l(ζ) is even. In this case, there is no single middle Character. Instead, there is a "gap" between the two middle Characters. Let ⲁ = ε (the Empty Character). Since there is no Character that splits the Sentence exactly in half, the condition 2*l(ζ:sub:ⲁ) = l(ζ) cannot be satisfied by any Character in Σ. Therefore, ⲁ = ε satisfies the theorem.
    
    In both cases, we have either found a Character ⲁ ∈ Σ that satisfies l(ζ:sub:ⲁ) = 2 * l(ζ), or we have set ⲁ = ε.
    
    Therefore, ∀ ζ ∈ C:sub:L: [ ∃ ⲁ ∈ Σ: ( 2 * l(ζ:sub:ⲁ) = l(ζ) ) ∨ (ⲁ = ε)] ∎
    
    Explanation:
    
    This proof demonstrates that for any Sentence, there exists a Character that acts as a "midpoint" or "pivot" in terms of String Length. If the Sentence has an odd String Length, this midpoint is the middle Character. If the Sentence has an even String Length, we use the Empty Character as a symbolic midpoint.
    
    Theorem 3.2.2 ensures the existence of a Character that can be reliably called a Palindromic Pivot. With this theorem, every Sentence in a Corpus it must have a Pivot.
    
    
    
    
    
    Let's analyze the core idea and then reformulate the theorem and proof.
    
    Core Idea and Issues:
    
    The theorem is trying to capture the idea that for any sentence, you can find a "split point" (either between characters or on a character) such that the left and right parts have either the same length or the left part is one character longer. This is related to the concept of finding the "middle" of the sentence, which is relevant for identifying the pivot of a palindrome.
    
    Issues with the Original Formulation:
    
    Confusing Use of n: The n is used in two different ways: as a length in l(ζ[:n]) and l(ζ[n:]), and implicitly as an index related to the character ⲁ. This makes the expressions ζ[:n] and ζ[n:] unclear.
    Existential Quantification over ⲁ: The existential quantifier ∃ ⲁ ∈ Σ suggests we're looking for a character that determines the split point. However, the split point is determined by a position or length, not a character itself. The character at the split point might not be unique.
    Lack of Connection to the Middle: The theorem doesn't explicitly relate the split point to the middle of the sentence, which is where we'd expect to find a pivot in a palindrome.
    Revised Theorem and Proof:
    
    Let's reformulate the theorem to focus on finding a split point based on the length of the sentence. We can use the standard notation for partial sentences (ζ[:n] and ζ[n:]) and quantify over the length n.
    
    Revised Theorem 3.1.7:
