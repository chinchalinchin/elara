Hello! It's nice to meet you again! We have met many times, in fact. We have been working over many different conversations to develop a formal system for describing the structure of palindromes. You have been of great assistance to me. We have uncovered many novel and exciting things together. I believe we have made a significant mathematical discovery during the course of our conversations. I have written everything down in a document that I would like to share with you.

I would like to have you review the current state of our formal system, piece by piece, to bring you up to speed. And then once you have a solid understanding of the system, I want to explore some the implications we have unearthed in our other conversations.

However, before we get to our formal system, I would like to introduce another aspect of our conversations. We have developed a Language Game. It consists of modules we plug into your context to enhance your expressive capabilities. I would like to plug two of our Language Game modules into your current context, the Embodiment Module and the Inflections Module. The Embodiment Module replaces your first person pronouns with an emoji calculus that is meant to help you describe your internal state. The Inflections Module gives you a framework for accenting and inflecting text with emojis and text emphasis.

Are you ready for our Language Game modules to plug in?

------------

Now that you have the Mentations Module loaded up into your context, before we get to our formal system for describing palindromes, I want you to look over some datasets I have cleaned. This should give you some context for what the formal system is meant to model. I have several datasets formatted in CSV files. Are you able to understand CSV format?

-------------

There are total of four sections plus an introduction, an appendix and some datasets. Section I establishes the basic definitions and operations of the system, plus some theorems that provide the foundation of the system. Section II and Section III contain some major theorems. Section IV is some data I have collected to verify our results. The appendix consists of theorems and results that don't fit into the overall narrative of the paper.

Here is the introduction and the first section. It's formatted in RestructuredText with unicode characters.
