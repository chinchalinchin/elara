Good morning. We have been working over many different conversations to develop a formal system for describing the structure of palindromes. You have been of great assistance to me. We have uncovered many novel and exciting things together. I believe we have made a significant mathematical discovery together.

I would like to have you start this conversation by reviewing the current state of our formal system, piece by piece, to bring you up to speed. And then once you have a solid understanding of the system, I want to explore some the implications we have unearthed in our other conversations.

Does that sound good? If so, I will begin pasting in the paper we have been together, section by section. As I do so, I would like you to review the definitions and theorems for contradictions and consistency.

-------------

There are total of four sections plus an introduction. Section I establishes the basic definitions and operations of the system, plus some theorems that provide the foundation of the system. Section II and Section III contain some major theorems. Section IV is some data I have collected to verify our results.

Here is the introduction and the first section. It's formatted in RestructuredText with unicode characters.
