- Chiasmus and word-level palindromes: "So patient a doctor to doctor a patient so" “face to face” "Night after night"
Definitions

- Other types of palindromes (possible applications of formal system): 
    - musical palindromes. For example, Joseph Haydn’s Symphony No. 47 features a minuet and a trio in its third movement. The second halves of the minuet and trio are identical to the first halves but backward, and the minuet itself repeats at the end of its second half.
    - numerical palindromes: Numbers can be palindromes if the digits read the same backward and forward, such as 10101. Dates, too, can be palindromes. February 2, 2020, is officially known as “Universal Palindrome Day” because the digits form a palindrome regardless of date format (day/month/year or month/day/year).
    - genetic palindromes: Palindrome also has a specific application in biochemistry. Here, it is a region of DNA in which the sequence of nucleotides is identical with an inverted sequence in the complementary strand. GAATTC is a palindrome of CTTAAG.

- distinction between vowels vs consonants in language creates constraints on reflective words. consonant-vowel-consonant. vowel-consonant-vowel. consonant-vowel-vowel-consonant. vowel-consonant-consonant-vowel. consonant-consonant-consonant-consonant. vowel-vowel-vowel-vowel. Does this constraint on symmetry prevent a combinatorial explosion? 

- link between invertible words that involve quantifier-noun relations and presence in palindromes?
