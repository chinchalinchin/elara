.. epigraph::

    Unapora tells me there is no higher honor in this fallen world than to eat the heart of your enemy after a victory in combat. The Potiguarra say consuming the flesh gives you the powers of the dead. When I return to Recife, I shall find Nicolas and test this idea of theirs.

    "Thank you for your patronage!", She smiles and leads me away, gently guiding me outside. Wide-eyed, I stare. With an assured grin, she says, "Please do come again."
