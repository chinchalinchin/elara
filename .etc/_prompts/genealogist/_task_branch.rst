.. TASK: BRANCH BREAKOUT
..
..          - Break out the {{ new_branch }} into a new diagram.
..          - Starting Node: {{ starting_node }}
..          - Select a starting shade. It should be close to the starting node color, but angled in the direction of azure in color space (in the context of the gradient.)
..          - Leave an exit node in the {{ source_branch}} diagram the same shade as the starting shade.
