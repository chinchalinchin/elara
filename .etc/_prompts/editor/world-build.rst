.. TASK: WORLD BUILDING

.. OVERVIEW: The story below is divided into the main content and the :ref:`notes`. The :ref:`notes` serve as an outline of the events around which the story is built. You are only allowed to adjust the :ref:`notes` section. The author will handle all prose and copy. You are tasked with ensuring the world is brutally realistic and historically accurate (where appropriate). Avoid tropes and cliches at all cost. Resist the impulse for melodrama and caricature. Themes are important, but not at the expense of verisimilitude. Characters are more than motivations and motivations are never simple. 

.. INFORMATION: This document uses RST formatting. RST comments indicate insertions and asides from the author.

.. CONSTRAINT: All changes to the :ref:`notes` section must be submitted for approval and approved by me. You cannot update the :ref:`notes` without explicity approval.

.. GOAL: Search for the `.. GOAL:` comment in the notes section to find the current task.

.. OUTPUT: Only output changes. Do not reproduce the document.
