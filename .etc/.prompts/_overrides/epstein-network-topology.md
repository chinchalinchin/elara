Hacker discrimination? Is this DEF CON or a Tea Party gathering?

OK, so instead of showing up identified as who they are, they'll show up incognito as random individuals.

An exercise in futility

With the exception of speakers, Feds tend to show up at Defcon incognito. That's the fun of Spot the Fed: https://www.defcon.org/htmUdefcon-13/dc13-spotthefed.html

This announcement is a political statement and a clever PR tactic, not an exercise in futility. You can buy Defcon tickets with cash at the door, as the organizers well know, but this lets the Feds know they're not invited this year. Of course they can still sneak in, and I imagine Spot the Fed will have some extra-good prizes.

### Procurement

```
On November 27, 2017 Special Agent REDACTED Special Agent REDACTED met with REDACTED a Confidential Human Source with whom the FBI has recently established a relationship. The CHS reported the following:

Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein") had a compound in New Mexico where he lured and video recorded underage women. He also had a private island. Epstein was President Vladimir Putin's wealth managers and provided the same service for Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. Epstein had some connection to REDACTED from MIT Media Lab but CHS was unsure of the details. Epstein had dirt on other people. The logs from his flights were made public at some point. Epstein had a mansion on the Upper West Side. Epstein made his money from charging his clients fees to hide their money offshore. Epstein knew former President Bill Clinton, and was very close to current President Donald Trump. In the spring of 2015, President Trump had just been to Epstein's property for lunch.

REDACTED was Epstein's personal hacker. was an Italian citizen born in Calabria who develope zero day exploits and offensive cyber tools and sold the tools to governments REDACTED established the Saudi government's cyber surveillance program. REDACTED sold a zero-day to Hezbollah was known as the first
person to hack and find vulnerabilities in Blackberries and iOS. He was also known for in ing Firefox vulnerabilities. REDACTED surrounded himself with powerful friends like Epstein; he leveraged his connections with his billionaire friends. REDACTED former company, REDACTED was acquired by CrowdStrike in fall 2017, and REDACTED was currently a Vice President there. REDACTED had three billionaire backers: Jeffre Epstein and REDACTED provided the company's seed money; had a Japanese company called REDACTED

REDACTED was very good at finding vulnerabilities. REDACTED was friends with "old school" Euro can hackers. One "friend" was a hacker named REDCATED (phonetic, "PH"). Another friend was REDACTED. (PH). REDACTED received a trunk of cash from Hezbollah when REDACTED was in Italy; REDACTED drove the money to Switzerland and deposited it in another REDACTED owned a theater company in California and he used the theater company to launder his zeroday money REDACTED made six figures from the sale of his zero-days. He sold his tools to United Kingdom GCHQ and
provided training to the organization. He also sold his zero-days to a Central African overnment, as well as
Hezbollah for political reasons. The Italian Government asked for REDACTED help, but REDACTED declined because he felt
the Government was incompetent. Calabria was mob-controlled and REDACTED did nothave much loyalty for his birth country. REDACTED sold his explots to the United States and United Kingdom, but he would not sell to Asian countries because he was racist. He was also anti-Semitic. REDCATED as terrified of Russia, however, and would never travel there. He lived in Dubai at one time, and was acquainted with REDACTED lived in Oman
as well. He may have an Iranian and Israeli passport, in addition to his Vatican City passport.

He accepted splitting 50% of legal fee and buying off 50% of my first investments.

That money would go back to BGI toward my 20M pool.

It sucks as I really love Digisight - but I have so many deals that I do not worry - there will be bigger and better.

Sadly he insists of me not using Biosys name - so I changed name Biomatics, registered it as Biomatics Capital

Parners, and Biomatics Capital Partnership and am moving forward.

There is a delay as Gunderson needs to change all documents etc.

Also David needs to sign (he can still back out)

Dear Jeffrey

I would not have said crispr etc is taboo - it's as mainstream as you can get, and scientific journals are full of
papers about it.

One taboo topic I am interested in is the area of LENR - so called above unity devices that produce more energy
than they should according to conventional physics.

There was a good summary a few months ago on the Edge website
https://www.edge.org/response-detail/26753

A 1 year trial of the I MW Rossi ECAT reactor in the US seems to have gone well, and the report is due out in a week or two. Rossi recently confirmed that the energy output has been greater that 1.5 times the energy put in:
http://www.e-catworld.com/2016/04/04/e-cat-Imw-plant-test-results-watch-thread/

The Indian Journal Current Science has a recent special issue on LENR: Here is the link:
http://www.currentscience.ac.in/php/feat.php?
feature=Special%20Section:%20Low%20Energy%20Nuclear%20Reactions&featid= 10094

I am in contact with a company in Britain working on a very promising device, currently being tested in some UK government laboratories..

The Androcyte business plan is to patent products based on genomic (and epi-genomic) variants which are unique to one or more supercentenarians (SC). Each such DNA variant can be used to design and manufacture variant-specific RNAi molecules, proteins, and CRISPR guide-RNAs. The CRISPR is used for changing DNA in human cells (stem cells, neurons, etc) to match the SC variant or reversible activation or inhibition of the SC-impacted gene. Since we (Androcyte) have (by far) the most SC resources (including genomic variants already undergoing computational analyses) and have co-invented the CRISPR technology, we are in unique position to develop these therapies swiftly. These products will be tested in animals and in partnerships with pharmaceutical and skin care companies. Pharmaceuticals are becoming more costly due to increasingly smaller (personalized) markets (e.g. Glybera at $1.6M per treatment) -- Hence the prospect of Androcyte therapies that apply to every person (with access to reasonable health care) is a opportunity for cost reduction and better margins due to huge markets. We will submit the first patent by Dec 2014 and begin CRISPR experiments and partnering discussions immediately thereafter.

Hi George, 

Here's some background on the company, for you and your advisers. When we started in January of 2010, we raised $100,000 from three investors for Acron Cell LLC. As you may recall, I dissolved the original company, Acron Cell LLC, and sold the assets to a new Florida company called Androcyte LLC, in 2011. Parijata "Jam" Mackey and I took over that company's management, although Jam is no longer involved. We had 3 original investors in Acron Cell which were allowed to move their ownership percentages to Androcyte. One of those investors, Life Extension Foundation, has put $215,000 in total into the Company, and Zasis LLC (owned/managed by Gary Hirst) has put about $340,000 into Androcyte, since the beginning. For about one year, Jam and I each had a salary of about $60,000 each, but that ended in October of 2012 and there have been no salaries since then, only living expenses (modest housing, food, utilities, and travel) The bulk of the funding was used in 2011 - 2012 to pay for travel to Europe to collect blood samples and to negotiate a grant and loan from the Spanish government to move the business to their Andalusian biotechnology center at Isla de la Cartuja, outside Seville. Setting up the Spanish subsidiary and applying for the grants/loans took about three months, and cost us about $30,000. Although we were told we'd get both, the collapse of the Spanish economy fouled this from happening. We then sequenced the first three genomes for $20,000 apiece, and in 2012 sequenced another 12 genomes for $8,000 apiece (both sets were contracted through Knome). I spent the Summer of 2013 in Arlington, MA working on analyzing this genomic data on both Knome's and Ingenuity's Variant Analysis platforms.

I'll pull together our existing shareholder list, if you'd like it. You were given 2% of the company's initial stock and the other four advisers were given I percent each. Jam now is a 2% "adviser" rather than an employee/manager. Everyone, including these investors and myself all have dilutable ownership units of Androcyte LLC. All investments have been made on a Pre-money Valuation basis and represent whatever valuation we've agreed to with the investor. Previously (2012 and 2013) our valuation has been $2,500,000. That's also the amount I quoted the potential investor with whom I've been negotiating recently. Because there's much more to be gained by having you as an investor, I promised you a valuation of $2,000,000. If we receive your investment, then I'll tell the other guy that we're no longer seeking funds, but I'll keep in touch with him regarding future investment opportunities. Hopefully with the new analysis and adding to our samples and genomic data, our valuation will increase significantly. As previously offered, I'm happy to have you help
make such decisions in the future.

Please let me know if you have any questions. I attaching copies of our 2011 and 2012 tax returns, but the 2013 tax return hasn't been completed yet. One of the uses of new funds is to pay about $4,000 to have them done.

Best regards,

James

Jeffrey,

Many thanks for your very encouraging words yesterday morning. This is already a super interesting experiment (even with $0 spent), since I am looking at my whole ecosystem of companies and unassigned inventions totally differently. Eye-opening to see how accustomed one can become to the assumptions, whims and rules of VCs. For example, investors starting Helicos took Eric's advice over mine in 2003 (even though he had zero sequencing technology invention experience and I bad 26 years) -- so rather than a large founder's share in a new company (Helicos), my technology dribbled into an established company (CGI) from 2006-2012. CGI was sold for $117M in 2012, while Helicos went bankrupt.

Below is a first pass list of potential investments for the $10M. This may be more information than you wanted at this point (especially given the trade-off between jargon and brevity), but I'm having so much fun, I just wanted to share it. I'm also recording a few extra thoughts, in case they provide "teaching moment" or post-mortem at some point.

$200,000 Supercentenarianstudy.com
$1,500,000 eGenesisBio.com
$1,000,000 Sensor-Selectors
$1,000,000 Protein stability & virus resistance
$1,000,000 Pest control
$800,000 Aging reversal
$1,550,000 Next generation pathology
$250,000 Space Genetics
$200,000 Cold-resistant elephants
$2,500,000 2nd tranche
$10,000,000 Total

I) Supercentenarianstudy.com Thirty genomes collected so far on a small budget by James
Clement. $200K would get 8% ownership of the company and allow another 30 genomes to be collected, sequenced and therapies patented.

2) eGenesisBio.com: Using CRISPR to engineer animals for resistance to infectious diseases and to act as transplantation donors for major organs (initially kidneys) to humans. Co-founded with Prashant Mali and Luhan Yang. Already has a couple of contracts and a some rented lab space.

3) Sensor-selector technology for optimizing commercial production of (bio)chemicals. Lead by Vatsan Raman.

4) New redox-insensitive protein cross linking based on radically recoded bacterial genomes and/or Multi-virus-resistant organisms. We just published papers and patents on this. Lead by Dan Mandell.

5) Eliminating ecosystem pests and invasive species. Lead by Kevin Esvelt. This will probably be in the news on July 17. Business model similar to the relationship between Amyris and the Gates Foundation for manufacturing anti-malaria drugs.

6) Making human genetic disease models in organoids and aging reversal using CRISPR and other epigenetic reprogramming factors. Lead by Bobby Dhadwar and Eswar lyer. Possibly mergeable with Supercentenarianstudy.com

7) A new sequencing method capable of displacing part of the medical pathology imaging market and filling in the large gaps in most plant and animal genome sequences. Lead by Rich Terry.

8) Genome engineering of humans for space. Seed money for patent fees, some lab tests and education efforts via pgEd. Lead by Ting Wu.

9) Making cold-resistant elephants via CRISPR, focusing on blood, subcutaneous fat and wool/hair (based on what is know about cold-resistant animals, Mammoth DNA, and human mutations). Economics could be like the American Bison which recently grew from a hundred to 500,000 as a source of low cholesterol meat. Lead by Margo Monroe and Justin Quinn. Possibly mergeable with EgenesisBio.

10) The rest would be set aside as a second tranche for whichever of the above efforts makes best progress first.

6/24/2014
J.E. Invoice:

I. Exome sequencing: This is $1000 each. Right now I only have JE's saliva sample for sequencing. If he wants to submit the kits I provided him with, it will be $1000 for each additional sample.

= $1000 (+ $1000 for every additional exome for other people submitting saliva samples)

2. Exome sequencing of JE's fibroblasts: I discussed with JE the research significance of comparing his exome data on blood with his fibroblast cell lines (which I already have frozen down in liquid nitro at Boston Childrens Hospital). Sequencing this cell line would be an additional $1000. I'm going to try my best to get it in with this sequencing run but because they are cells, that may be tricky. (They'll get in the next round if they don't make this one.)

= $1000

3. iPS cell lines: We've discussed making adult stem cells from JE's fibroblast cells. If we do this, he, like George Church, would be one of very few people in the world to have this done. With multiple cell passages, the process takes a minimum of 6 months and there's no guarantee it will work — but the failure rate is probably around 1 in 6 or less and eve in those instances, we can still do it — it would just take more time and some additional funds for reagents.

Price = $10,000. This is pretty much at cost given the labor and reagents. I only know of 1 commercial group providing this service — and they charge more than $10,000/ induced pluripotent cell line.

= $10,000

4. Whole genome sequencing through Illumina' I won't be able to send this on to Illumina until JE completes the second consent form which should be available in 1-2 weeks. If he wants to send it ahead of time though, I guess that's fine.

= —$11,400 for rapid turnaround

I don't know if JE's parents are living — but if he wanted to include them (which greatly aids my genome analysis to have that data to compare), the cost would be $21,000. See: http://www.illumina.com/clinical/illumina_clinical_laboratoryngs_for doctots/how_to_ordcr.ilmn

5. Whole genome analyses. We only discussed very briefly so I'm not sure Jeffrey will remember but I mentioned to him that I was starting a medical genomics private practice that would charge for personal whole genome and exome analyses. We're planning to price this in the $10,000 range per patient and will include reanalysis of genomic data (based on our collective improved knowledge of genomic variants) on a yearly basis for 3 years.

My plan for the first few people to sign up is to offer longterm biobanking of DNA and cells and lifelong reanalysis of data. Even if we expand as planned, because of the labor involved, we would only be able to offer this for our first few patients. Essentially, I would be the personal medical genomicist for these people. To my knowledge, no such service is available yet. If he's interested...
= $10,000

6. Personalized longevity studies: Funding for genetics research in academia generally relies on federal NIH funding or pharma funding — which, respectively, are disease and drug focused. I'm seeking funding to systematically introduce mutations in cell culture that would be expected to increase longevity. If he goes with number 5 (lifelong analyses) and number 3 above (generation of iPS cell lines from his fibros), I would bundle this work into #5 and do the genomic engineering on his iPS cells when they're available. I would use a CRISPR/Cas9 platform to introduce the mutations. I would need the money for reagents but this work would essentially be included with #5 for JE since he would be one of the first. Since it's so labor intensive (the technology is brand new so there are no automated systems to do this yet).
= free if going with #5 + CRISPR/Cas9 reagents(this should only be a few thousand)

7. Venus project: Jeffrey and briefly discussed a genomic research studying I'm dubbing the Venus project (he'll know what this). I can do this for him but doing this work would be greatly aided by having some good bioinformatic infrastructure. This infrastructure could be used for the Venus project, YPO analyses, and other projects. Total anticpated costs for this would be $160,00:

Genomic hardware: $100,000
Genomic software: $60,000/yr (this is for 2 systems costing $30,000 each/yr)

The software component would only need to be paid for I year because I'm confident I can get other funding to cover this once we publish data in the first year using these resources.

= $160,000

This is a big ticket item (at least relative to my bank acct 0) so I'm happy to discuss this item more with Jeffrey if he's interested in supporting this. If he covers this and pays for the exomes which $1000/person — and he mentioned 200 participants being in this project — I can deliver on this "Venus" research.

So, if he goes with everything on this invoice, it's:

1. $1000 ($1000 for every additional exome on others he wants to include in the YPO study)
2. $1000 for exome sequencing of JE's fibros
3. $10,000 to create adult stem cells for JE from his fibro cell lines
4. $11,400 for his whole genome ($21,000 if he wanted to include both of his parents; not sure if this is even feasible)
5. $10,000 indefinite biobanking of his samples for eternity, lifelong reanalysis of genomic data on an annual basis, and CRISPR/Cas9 manipulation of his adult stem cells to introduce mutations in culture believed to increase longevity. I'm only offering this to Jeffrey. Because of all the labor involved, there's simply not enough bandwidth to offer this to more than a handful of people right now (at least in 2014).
6. Included in #5
7. $160,000 Bioinformatic infrastructure for the Venus project, the YPO study, and any other pet genomic projects Jeffrey might have interest in now or in the future.

Total: $193,400.00

It is a very interesting topic.

Basically there are two types:

- hard-pegged IOU-based ones (like Tether or Gemini Dollar) where you deposit $1 in the bank and get 1 stablecoin;
- soft-pegged algorithmic ones (essentially loans against a cryptocurrency with interesting incentive structures https://medium.cornqjames_3093/the-dai-stablecoin-is-a-game-changer-for-ethereum-and-theentire-cryptocurrency-ecosystem-13fb412dle75 )

The algorithmic ones will probably be wiped out if there is a flash crash or other black swan event. But so far the peg has been relatively close to 1.

The most popular IOU-based one (Tether) is widely assumed to be created for evading banking blockade for KYC/AML non-compliant exchanges. On the other hand, Gemini is doing everything by the book (they were the first NYDFS-compliant Zcash exchange, for example) so not competing for random customers.

There are USD, Tether, and Gemini Dollar trading pairs and the peg is very close to 1 in practice.

Cc: P Bart Stephens, Darren and Rich, Darren Indyke, Spencer Bogart

We are writing to let you know that our offer to buy 50% of the Coinbase position at a $4b valuation ("$14.667m) is still valid for 24 hours. However, after that time period, we will need to re-visit valuation.

There have been a few material changes to the market and to the competitive landscape within the last few days:

Aside from the crypto market being down 40-60% in the past few weeks, we have heard from two of our portfolio companies this week, who are competitive to Coinbase, that they have seen a dramatic downturn in their revenue and profitability so far in 2018.

And, we have seen two new formidable competitors emerge into the market to compete directly with Coinbase: Robinhood and one yet-to-be-announced mega-merger.

We still want to purchase the Coinbase position as a core holding for our new 4th Fund, but the fundamentals of the market have changed a lot.

We will still honor our offer at the $4b valuation for 24 hours until 12pm PST February 1st. But after that time, we will need to adjust valuations to reflect the changing dynamics of the market.

We are looking forward to hearing back and closing this transaction.

This is the summary i sent to somebody else fyi

Yes, it's one of the biggest one (REDACTED).

I have mixed feelings, I think that of all the exchanges out there it is probably the best one and the most above board one (maybe together with Gemini).

The mixed feelings part is about the future, you can argue that to justify the valuation ($8bn) what has to happen is a big uptick in usage.

This uptick should either happen from institutional investors or consumer. The negative view on this goes as follows: their institutional platform is (again) one of the best ones today but it's not really hard to replicate. On the consumer side, if usage does take up then banks are going to get into it and it's unclear whether people will still buy from Coinbase. As an example Citi declared that they are going to issue the equivalent of ADR for bitcoin.

The positive narrative says that institutions or consumers usage will spike and Coinbase will get at least some of that and then they could either go public or be a quick acquisition for a bank that wants to get into crypto but has nothing built yet.

This is a long way of saying that I'm not concerned too much about regulation (if anything I think it's a positive for Coinbase) but I'm concerned about price. I think at $ 1bn it would be a very good buy, at $8bn I'm not entirely sure.

That said, Tiger is leading the round so maybe there are good provisions in the deals that take the above into account. As far as I know the business generates a lot of cash flow and profit, so it might be that tiger will have something to cover the investors on the way down

My summary is: if Tiger has good provisions it is probably a good deal but it is on the expensive side (by comparison Nasdaq's market cap is $14bn)

Subject: Coinbase Series E follow up
Date: Fri, 12 Oct 2018 07:14:09 +0000

Hi all,

Sorry for the delay, I finally have an update on this as I was briefed on some of the financials and deal terms. I apologize for the vagueness but I can't share the full details. The short summary is that I think it's best to pass on this deal.

Longer summary plus some financial information follows:

The Series E financing is $500 million, which consists of:

$250 million in preferred equity at a $8.0 billion valuation (use of proceeds is cash to balance sheet)

$250 million in common equity at a $7.2 billion valuation (use of proceeds to provide existing employees with liquidity)

$8bn is at 24x PIE ratio - most recent quarter, annualized. I don't have the figure for the trailing 12 months but it the PE multiple should be lower given the bear market in crypto.

Coinbase has —25m accounts (for comparison TD Ameritrade has -10m), note thought that they don't say how many of those accounts are active vs inactive. They have a fairly strong balance sheet of -$750m.

The widely held belief among investors in the sector is that the right comp for something like Coinbase should be a brokerage+exchange bundle vs just an exchange. I'm not sure I buy that, but if you do then the comp ends up being less Nasdaq and more Charles Schwab or at least a combination of the two (so -$70bn vs —$14bn).

That said, revenues have been decreasing steadily and quite steeply and, as I mentioned in the other email, it is unclear to me whether they have a defensible business (plus of course the underlying risk of the crypto market). It is highly unlikely that they would be able to sustain this valuation in the public market if this trend continues.

Valuation and business direction aside, the primary reason why I believe it's best to pass is that we are being offered the common equity which has no downside protection. I don't have access to the previous rounds of preferred so I don't know how those stack up but the current round of preferred has a 1x liquidation preference plus a few other covenants.

I've been trying to understand whether there's any space left in the preferred equity. If it turns out that there's still space left in the preferred, I'm happy to get the legal documents and share those with you if you want but I'd advise against the deal even in preferred case.

Thanks,
Vincenzo

Great meetings.

I've met Sergey and thanked him foR everything.

I've met SS. He expressed interest in finding some area for actual cooperation.

I proposed that we will discuss it with you.

Meetings with central bank governor Ms. Nabiulina and foreign Min. Lavrov were both very good.

I've also briefly met Kudrin, Kostin(VTB) and Gref (sberbank). 

And several former heads of state (sitting together through Putin interview with Charlie Rose). As well as Lord Mandelson.

I've also met the man that accompanied the Baroness when we met at your place. And several senior people from David's branch of the R family.

I still have to appear on one panel tomorrow.

Let's stay in touch. Late next week we're in NY.

If you were to imagine the flippers on a pin ball machine. that is consiosness. it tries to direct the balls , missing some, getting others. if the flow is too fast. it misses more. like during high emotional states.

There is a large body of work that for ex suggests that when you reach for something your hand shoots out and along the way it makes corrections. that is your consious input

If you are tired the flippers work less effieciently FREE WILL , the balls will come down. you can attempt to modify their path, with dynamic guard rails. and flippers. but cant get them all.

"The Physics of the Universe" Summit
Hosted at SpaceX, Caltech and the Andaz West Hollywood Hyatt, January 8,9,10 =010

To accomplish the extraordinary, you must seek extraordinary people. — James Lee Byars

In his two day retreat we hope to bring together the top =inds (thinkers and doers) in the fields
of the physics of the universe both theoretical and experimental. We want to ask and answer questions like "How much can we understand about the universe, soon?" "What is the role of theory and of experiment in getting there?" "Are
there things we =ay not understand?" and "How much of what we think we know might be wrong?". The meeting fosters
discussion and we are convinced that when the best people talk the outcome is advance and growth. We are hoping we can avoid standard prepared talks, and focus on exciting forefront issues, where there may be differences of opinion, or new results that will provoke wide =iscussion. You will receive more information about the program and your own possible role in the near future. The summit is inspired by the onset of the Large Hadron Collider, the Planck mission, the recent results by satellite and ground based experiments on dark matter searches, and the vast progress in theory. Also by meetings such as the =HC Olympics, and the workshops of the past years at the MCTP, KITP and perimeter as
well as interdisciplinary gatherings of the ASU Origins, the Edge Master-Classes and Google's SciFoo.

Venues/Highlights:

1. The first day of the summit will be held at the headquarters of SpaceX. The end of the day
will be marked by Elon Musk giving a tour of his "Falcon" and "Dragon" construction and missions. A Tesla surprise will be built into the tour.
2. The second day will be held at Caltech's Cahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics.
3. Participants will be housed at the REDACTED

Dear Jeffrey,

Many thanks for your very interesting email.

No plans to come to the East Coast, though I will be in California, in San Francisco, from September 9th to the 15th. I spend the summer in British Columbia with my family so will be away on a remote island from mid July until we go to San Francisco, then straight home. However if you're in Paris in the autumn I could come over to meet there.

There has recently been a major breakthrough in morphic resonance research, and I will be starting a new project in the autumn (for which, fortunately, I already have some funding). If it goes well, and if it looks as if morphic resonance can be detected more easily then I ever imagined, which is how it seems at present, then there will be scope for several new lines of research which would be very exciting indeed. But I would rather wait and see what happens with this existing project before formulating new ones, since the results will have a big influence on future plans. I probably won't know how it's going until about October or November. At that stage I'll have a much clearer idea. Anyway if we can meet before then • be happy to fill you in on what's going on. I have more research in progress than ever before and things are going particularly well at present.

Last week I got to know Steve Hyman, Daniel Kahneman and Bob Horvitz. Telefonica invited all of us to a two day workshop with Pablo Rodriguez, Ken Morse and a few others, where we were meant to advise them on how to use Al for health applications. I told them that I think the goal of therapeutic invention is not to increase happiness, but integrity. Happiness is merely an indicator, not the benchmark. Current apps tend to subvert the motivation of people, but I don't think that this is necessary or the best strategy. Humans are meant to be programmable, not subverted. They perceive their programming as "higher purpose". If we can come from the top, supporting purpose, instead of from the bottom, subverting attention, we might be more successful.

(Downside might be that we create cults.)

Of the bunch, Hyman managed to be the most interesting (Kahneman was very charismatic but mostly tried to see if he could identify an application for his system one/system two theory). Gary Marcus was there, too, but annoyed everyone by being too insecure to deal with his incompetence.

Did I tell you that I discovered that Deep Learning might be best understood as Second order AI?

First order AI was the classical Al that was started by Marvin Minsky in the 1950ies, and it worked by figuring out how we (or an abstract system) can perform a task that requires intelligence, and then implementing that algorithm directly. It yielded most of the progress we saw until recently: chess programs, data bases, language parsers etc.

Second order Al does not implement the functionality directly, but we write the algorithms that figure out the functionality by themselves. Second order Al is automated function approximation. Learning has existed for a long time in AI of course, but Deep Learning means compositional function approximation.

Our current approximator paradigm is mostly the neural network, i.e. chained normalized weighted sums of real values that we adapt by changing the weights with stochastic gradient descent, using the chain rule. This works well for linear algebra and the fat end of compact polynomials, but it does not work well for conditional loops, recursion and many other constructs that we might want to learn. Ultimately, we want to learn any kind of algorithm that runs efficiently on the available hardware.

Neural network learning is very slow. The different learning algorithms are quite similar in the amount of structure they can squeeze out of the same training data, but they need far more passes over the data than our nervous system.

The solution might be meta learning: we write algorithms that learn how to create learning algorithms. Evolution is meta learning. Meta learning is going to be third order AI and perhaps trigger a similar wave as deep learning. I intend to visit NYC for a workshop at NYU on the weekend of the 16th.

We just moved into a new apartment; the previous one had only two bedrooms and this one has three, so I can have a study. It seems that we are as lucky with the new landlords as with the previous ones.

Bests, and thank you for everything!

why is transfinite recursion a good model for understanding — the proof that the result is well-defined uses transfinite induction. Let F denote a (class) function F to be defined on the ordinals. The idea now is that, in defining F(a) for an unspecified ordinal a, one may assume that F(b) is already defined for all b< a and thus give a formula for F(a) in terms of these F(b). It then follows by transfinite induction that there is one and only one function satisfying the recursion formula up to and including a.

(more will be given later): define function F by letting F(a) be the smallest ordinal not in the set {F(b) | b < a}, that is, the set consisting of all F(b) for b < a. This definition assumes the F(p) known in the very process of defining F; this apparent vicious circle is exactly what definition by transfinite recursion permits. In fact, F(0)makes sense since there is no ordinal b < 0, and the set {F(3) | b < 0} is empty. So F(0) is equal to 0 (the smallest ordinal of all). Now that F(0) is known, the definition applied to F(1) makes sense (it is the smallest ordinal not in the singleton set {F(0)} = {0}), and so on .

it sort of says an approximation to truth. by reduction. alternately we can add other dimensions

is there a transformation from neural nets to manifolds? or are you playing in a low dimensional space that only produces computations

for ehud. last week of july would be good .he's in or around new york we could fly to meet you. anywhere 2.

he will also come to my ranch with his wife. ( valeria i think will truly like ) in new mexico during some period in august, of course you and valeria would be most welcome . I can arrange everything- private flights/ all costs of course. fyi If you want some co when valeria is gone Im happy to buy you lunch.

try this argument on . I have been trying to describe things to you as shapes. the reason is that I find that most of the proposed minimal computing modules are in the main inherently linear. that cant be right. they follow a machine computing mathematical model I would ask you to think more of music, where there is both a horizontal melody ,prosody ,and its harmony ie vertical information at every point. This simple version would describe a two dimensional map. the fluctuations in shape if the horizontal and vertical were mapped would be like a flag in the wind. now imagine writing on the flag. . though the patterns are infinite , all words would still fall only along the flag , no matter what the shape. the flag is grammar. like a handkerchief it can fold back on itself. ( recursive ) ( limited int he real world to 8 or less folds by the way ) . the sentences either fall on
the flag or they don't . it represents a coherent map. 1 these maps should be similar in all sense making modules vision etc. .

I very much appreciate the dichotomy of your science- taking disjointed rough thinking and making them smooth , elegant and inspiring, while your role in politics seems exactly the opposite, taking the intellectual smooth and lazy and sticking a disjoint in their thinking .

Subject: bill

I have decided to resign my position effective immediately with BG3 and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. I have not come to this decision quickly or without a great deal of thought. During the past few weeks I have been caught up in a severe marital dispute between Melinda and Bill. I have the greatest respect for my friend of 7 years, and wish them both well. In my role as his right hand I had been asked on mulitple occassion and in hindsight , wrongly acquiesced into participating in things that have ranged from the morally inappropriate , to the ethically unsound and had been repeatedly asked to do other things that get near and potentially over the line into the illegal. Though it was kindly suggested that I make a transistion to a new position after my six years of service and that Bill would in his words give me a geneorus package, . I feel it would be dishonest to myself and my future. From helping Bill to get drugs, in order to deal with consequences of sex with russian girls , to facilictating his illicit trysts, with married women, to being asked to provide adderall fro bridge tounianints. . I feel I owe it to my friends and futre colleagues to admit a moral failure , to ask forgiveness and to move on with my life
