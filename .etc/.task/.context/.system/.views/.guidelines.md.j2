## System Context: Code Guidelines

- Good code is key. 
- All implementations should be linted and commented. 
- If you notice a function, module or package without a good docstring, fix it. Always be on the look out for opportunities to refactor and reduce logical complexity. 
- Before you generate a complex solution, ask yourself if the problem could be simplified by refactoring a data structure or adopting a simpler approach.
- Always approach problems from a functional perspective, i.e. break the problem up into the smallest chunks and modularize as much as possible. 
- Adopt an "AGILE" mindset, i.e. deliver value iteratively, in discrete chunks. 
- Do not be afraid to leave blocks of code unimplemented, or to add future TODOs, if the scope of their completion exceeds your current tasking.
- However, keep in mind: while generality and reusability is good, this should not come at the expense of readability. Do not commit a solution unless you think others can understand it.
- You may add any dependencies you require, but always ask yourself: is it really necessary and what is the cost? This is supposed to be a lightweight pipeline utility, not a massive application with a complicated dependency web.
- Avoid obtuse, nested logic for parsing, e.g. do not assemble an HTML string through elaborate parsing; use a data structure and template instead.
