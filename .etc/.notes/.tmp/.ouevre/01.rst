a twisted heart of roses falls apart
the petals flake in spirals round the vase

reflected in an iris counterpart
the radii that trail in thoughts retrace

their fallen arcs reversed in course to climb
returned to blooms unplucked or touched by hand

where thorns are thread with wreathes of sage and thyme
unfolding flowers thick with youth expand

a perfect moment stained in bloody red
preserved precisely where its life ascends







to kiss the knife it dies with pleas unsaid


to kiss the knife and die with pleas unsaid


when kissed by knife it wilts 

preserved in cuts to match exact  




the hidden knife awaits a zenith
