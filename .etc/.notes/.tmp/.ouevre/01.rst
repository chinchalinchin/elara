a twisted heart of roses falls apart
the petals flake in spirals round the vase

reflected in an iris counterpart
the radii that trail in thoughts retrace

their fallen arcs reversed in course to climb
returned to blooms unplucked or touched by hand

where thorns are thread with wreathes of sage and thyme
unfolding flowers thick with youth expand





a perfect moment stained in bloody red

the hidden knife awaits a zenith
