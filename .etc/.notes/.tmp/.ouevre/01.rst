a twisted heart of roses falls apart;
the petals flake in spirals round the vase.
reflected in an iris counterpart,
the radii that trail in thoughts retrace

their fallen arcs reversed in course to climb,
return to blooms unplucked or touched by hand.
when thorns were thread with wreathes of sage and thyme
unfolding flowers thick with youth expand
