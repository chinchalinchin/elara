.. TASK: NODE EXPANSION
..
..      - Find any endpoints of the {{ branch }} branch that are not ended with (--x), with (--o) or branched into another diagram ([[Branch Exit]]). **Select at most three** so you will have capacity to ensure any additions or modifications are rigorously vetted. Determine if they should be expanded around their descendants, or capped (--x).
..      - Ensure any nodes you add or update have birth and death years.
..      - Apply the retroactive rule to any branch **you modify** that has reached its endpoint (--x), i.e. convert their ancestors relation into a dot (--o)
..      - Ensure you follow all restrictions and guidelines. In particular, DO NOT TERMINATE A LINE WITHOUT EVIDENCE or REMOVE ANY NODES (unless justified by evidence).
