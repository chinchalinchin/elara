.. TASK: COUSIN SEARCH
..
..      - Search pairs of branches for common surnames and relations that might indicate the marriage of cousins across branches and webs of relations that are not yet captured in the graphs. Verify and validate with evidence between concluding kinship.
..      - If any relations across branches are found, divide them into three categories:
..          - A. relations that can be fixed with an ENTER/EXIT relation.
..          - B. relations that require elaborate lineages of unexplored nodes in the family tree.
..          - C. relations that require elaborated lineages of external families before they can be visualized.
..      - Address and update relations of Type A directly on the graphs.
..      - Add relations of Type B to the *Further Review* list. These will be addressed in future prompts.
..      - Add relations of Type C to the *Ignore* list.
