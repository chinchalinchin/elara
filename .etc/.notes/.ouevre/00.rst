Dystopia
--------

| The snow descends upon a place
|       sequestered on a crown,
| a hidden place the heights embrace
|       to shield from view a town.
| 
| The world below forgot to look,
|       erased its name from maps,
| and soon its people undertook
|       a course that brings collapse. 
|
| This town atop a mountain peak
|       where councils once convened,
| rebuked all art in harsh critique,
|       declared its aims demeaned. 
| 
| This place had placed a clause in laws
|       to cause a pause to rhymes,
| for rhymes were crimes within the claws
|       of lawful paradigms.
|
| So this defendant stands to rise
|       as bailiffs introduce
| the honored judge whose beady eyes
|       reflect a swinging noose.
|
| The gavel bangs, a lawyer bows
|       with empty head and face,
| "Your honor, please, if court allows,
|       I'd like to start the case."
|
| With arms behind and nose upturned,
|       the lawyer paces slow, 
| "This felon here has doubtless earned
|       a sentence down below.
|
| Before we throw him off the bluffs, 
|       let's hear his sordid tale,"
| The lawyer straightens out his cuffs,
|       dismissing thoughts of bail, 
|
|  "You stand accused of treachery!
    


| flabbergasted 
|

| "But don't you see, you rhyme like me!
|       each word you say "





| Denials come, but don't be tricked,
|       inspect his very clothes!"
| The accusations flung depict
|       a derelict of oaths,
|
| "A man with slacks of shaded blacks,
|       with mittens knitted neat,
| and zippered teeth that grip in tracks
|       around his slippered feet!
|
| A costume of provocateurs!
|       Temptations made to chime!
| These words once said, the clock assures,
|       will synchronize in time!"
|  
| The benches gasp, the jury faints,
|       their understanding whet;
| such disregard for law's constraints
|       had left his garb a threat.
|
| The lawyer stalks the hallowed hall, 
|       tirade ablaze on lips,
| "If that won't do, then please recall
|       the journal found in strips!
|
| This man right here, his notes betray
|       a poet's smitten soul!"
| He hoists a page, "Exhibit A!
|       The proof he lacks control:
|
| 'My heart is like a metaphor
|       that layers cannot hide,
| a part that looks much better for
|       the points that coincide'!"
|   
| A silence falls across the crowd.
|       The traitor sits accused,
| his echoed crimes relived aloud
|       as faces sneer bemused.         
|
| The lawyer shouts in sharp remand, 
|       "This thug must pay the price!"
| Then adding more, a stark demand,
|       "A hanging would suffice!"
|
| And so the prosecution rests
|       while hangmen tie their knots.
| Indictment looms; the man ingests
|       the end his charge allots. 
|
| ... in progress ... 

.. | He starts to stand, but falls aback,
.. | The cliffs that echoed back 
.. | the world below forgot to check
.. | The raucous crowds are rocked and cowed,
