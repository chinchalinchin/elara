General Rules
-------------

If ever in doubt as to the transliteration of a Philadelphian term into English, the following rules should be applied to arrive at an approximation.

1. The ``a`` Split

- **Rule**: a → ay-a (when it comes before an m, n, f, s, or th sound)
- **Explanation**: The short "a" sound, as in "cat," often becomes a two-part tense vowel.
- **Examples**: class → clay-ass, half → hay-af, pass → pay-ass.
- **Exceptions**: This rule also applies to the words mad, bad, and glad, but crucially, not to sad. This is why mad and sad do not rhyme.

2. The ``o`` Fronting

- **Rule**: Long o → e-o
- **Explanation**: The vowel in a word like "go" is "fronted," meaning it's produced more towards the front of the mouth.
- **Examples**: go → ge-o, no → ne-o.
- **Exceptions**: This does not apply when the vowel is followed by an 'l', so goal remains unchanged.

3. The ``ow`` Fronting

- **Rule**: ow/ou → e-ow
- **Explanation**: Similar to the long "o," the vowel sound in "down" is also fronted.
- **Examples**: down → de-own, mouth → me-owth.

4. The Raised ``aw``

- **Rule**: aw/off/augh → aw-uh
- **Explanation**: The vowel in "coffee" or "caught" is raised and pronounced as a diphthong (a two-part sound). This preserves the difference between words like cot and caught.
- **Examples**: coffee → caw-uh-fee, soft → saw-uhft, caught → caw-uht.

5. The ``on`` Shift

- **Rule**: on → awn
- **Explanation**: The word "on" is pronounced to rhyme with "dawn," not "don."
- **Example**: "Turn the lights awn."

6. The ``th``-Stopping

- **Rule**: The "th" sound (/θ/ and /ð/) at the beginning of a word is pronounced as a "t" or "d".
**Explanation**: The tongue stops the air by touching the ridge behind the teeth, instead of letting air pass through.
- **Examples**: this → dis, that → dat, three → tree.

7. The ``t``-Glottalization

- **Rule**: The "t" sound, especially before an "n" sound in the middle of a word, is replaced by a glottal stop (the sound in "uh-oh").
- **Explanation**: The sound is made by closing the vocal cords, not with the tongue.
- **Examples**: mountain → moun'in, button → buh'in, sentence -> sen'ence.

8. The ``L``-Vocalization

- **Rule**: The "l" sound at the end of a word or before a consonant often becomes a vowel-like sound, similar to "o" or "w".
- **Explanation**: Instead of the tongue-tip touching the roof of the mouth, the back of the tongue is raised.
- **Examples**: school → skew-oh, pool → pew-oh, towel → ta-oh.
