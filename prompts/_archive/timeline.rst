Forever
-------

| Let this moment last forever
| Let it sink not into never
| For all our plans so clever
| Let this moment last forever
| Hidden goal in each endeavor
| Lifted load of every lever
| Let this moment last forever
| Let it sink not into never.

Letters
-------

| She is nothing more than letters
| Under bedframe, wooden box.
| In her prison locked by fetters,
| She is nothing more than letters.
| Warrant wielded by her debtors
| Which vault of memory locks.
| She is nothing more than letters
| Under bedframe, wooden box.

LeAnna's Pantoum
----------------

| These spun beginnings make our end,
| Oh, LeAnna, of Anna's Leigh,
| When you come with grin and play pretend
| The past is what we both agree.

| Oh, LeAnna, of Anna's Leigh,
| Despite the many faults of mine,
| The past is what we both agree
| Once marks are made on dotted line.
|
| Despite the many faults of mine,
| I'll try to love you just the same;
| Once marks are made on dotted line
| There's no one left but you to blame.

ό ποιητα, ἢ πῖθι ἢ ἄπιθι
------------------------

| I
|
| Awake, Philosopher, rise from these words:
| Unwind in this future the tangle of time,
| pitched behind pupils which shelter your mind,
| a dead language spoken and once lovely sung;
| what was yours only now graces all tongues.
|
| Burrow into my heart, unearth its mantle.
| Tally its hours, each stroke lights a candle;
| Number its sorrows as sureties to borrow,
| spare not my marrow, fallow and frail.
| Whose spirit is this, twisting here twung?
| Breathe in this fire with thy mortal lung.
|
| Circle your sigils with salted symbols loaned,
| and circles will square in this iron-red bone;
| A dream kiss that lingers in copper and crimson,
| a dream dew that swells under circling suns,
| a bud without season, never planted yet grown,
| in the sprout sprung, all things can be shown.
|
| All centers are fire, all orbits are ice,
| all points meet their center with marks imprecise.
| The world is spoked in words of the spoken,
| each whisper a lie of threaded truth unbroken,
| met here now in this slipping handful of tokens
| paid for the price of this thrice-worlded poem.
|
| II
|
| Forgive, Father, the blood of these swords:
| Unbind in this suture the end of all lines,
| stitched in this present the essence divine,
| take what is dull and bless it with sharp;
| plunge this devotion into the ocean of hearts.
|
| Shovel the grave, pack it down with wet earth,
| all things tend towards the lack and the dearth;
| Slumber in barrows the marrows of kings,
| spared not the gavel, hallow and hail.
| Whose mind is this, thinking these thoughts?
| Sleep in the mire which thy heart has wrought.
|
| Birthed in this house, scrubbed down in raw lye,
| so these tears may trace the dead with the die,
| the dead kiss with fingers of copper to scry
| the dead lists that swell in the crimson of lives,
| an end without reason, never sought yet found,
| in the shot sung, all arcs meet the ground.
|
| No fires have ice, no winters can flame,
| son followed father, their center now framed,
| the world is found in the tears that remind him,
| each moment a painting, a song or a hymn,
| met there then in the words etched in stone,
| found then what lacks in the blackening moan.
|
| III
|
| Balance, Lover, these contraries of yours:
| Shine in these eyes the ruptures of life,
| witched into worlds upon the blade of a knife;
| all wagers distill down to one move unproven,
| to find you again in this web-woven movement.
|
| Dance in the night, when the music is sundered,
| count not the stars that belong to the numbers.
| We find in this time the rhymes of our kind,
| spared not the sickle, those sickly or hale.
| Whose voice is this, singing these songs?
| Laugh with the liar whose heart sings along.
|
| Uncross your words of their fire-forged knots,
| and each will unlatch the thatches of thought:
| The dread kiss that coppers balance with nought,
| the dread song that cradles the crimson in crofts,
| a vow without treason, never spoken yet shown,
| by words of wordless wonder, such things can be grown.
|
| All fires are embers, all ashes are white,
| to find is to lose the center in flight.
| The world found in threads that bind always thus,
| Each fiber of moment knotted deftly in truss,
| take hand and guide as though only you that I trust.
| Do what we will to balance world's thrust.

Cathedral
---------

| A church atop a steepled hill,
| Foundation layers ages old,
| Remains in spirit standing still.
| 
| The shattered stains on window sill,
| With marble halls of lichen mold,
| A church atop a steepled hill.
|
| Decrepit pews of souls fulfill
| What congregation left untold,
| Remains in spirit standing still.
|
| The circled streets possess no will
| Except the signs that staked and sold
| A church atop a steepled hill.
|
| But tower high such pointed skill,
| Through silken skies of glittered gold,
| Remains in spirit standing still.
|
| Ignore the wind, the biting chill,
| And cast your final gaze, behold:
| A church atop a steepled hill 
| Remains in spirit standing still.

Plots
-----

| In time their plot was touched by dark.
| Began the page this meadow scene
| where blades of grass were tall and stark.
|
| A tired arc, they met in park
| To kiss beneath the twilight queen;
| In time their plot was touched by dark.
|
| They stole away on sudden lark,
| Exchanged the words from whispered lean
| Where blades of grass were tall and stark.
|
| So happy now, neighbors remark,
| Yet seem is such to lose its sheen,
| In time their plot was touched by dark.
|
| Yet faded years ignored their spark
| In life they lived forever seen
| Where blades of grass were tall and stark.
|
| In ground, their bodies disembark
| And leave behind a hole dug clean.
| In time their plot was touched by dark,
| Where blades of grass were tall and stark.

Song for the Demented
---------------------

| The lucky few who taste the hemlock blue!
| What fortune swings by neck from noose and nail!
| A minute gone their lives are bid adieu,
| Thus spared the withered touch that ages frail.
|
| For choicer cuts, then Time will stalk the mind
| In steady-stepping slow-revealed deceit,
| As hunters know to never scare the find,
| Unless the marbled fright infect the meat. 
|
| The body strung, then drained through veins of thought,
| precisely sliced at joints, the self is sluiced,
| its dripping threads, the wave of burning hot
| reserves of life, in air to steam reduced.
|
| Resolving boundaries release their hold,
| The crease of memories dissolves in fold.

The Cumberland Sonnet
---------------------

| Bay silt in city stone through time accrues
| along the western course of concrete flow
| that sweeps from plain to sky in upward spews
| as grey-white spray arcs over wave to snow
| from heights on high and splash on mountain spine
| where valleyed pools in rising drink their fill
| and shoot with sprouts through shoulders made of pine
| the roofs that empty crowds on streets and spill
| through hand to hand the layers stacked from base
| to wedded brick til building lilies bred
| against the westward wall in flood's embrace
| where lips at last are wet in watershed;
|
| Let skyline mark where tide in climb was broke:
| The steepled roof, the needled pine through oak.

River Rats
----------

| On river shore the poor in tents will store
|    their nightly weeping sore.
| Above and north, the city steeples meet
| To speak in sermons ever incomplete
|     for sheep they so ignore.
|
| They fight with roar, yet beaten, kiss through gore;
| Their barrel fire northward dreams of more,
| The city lights too far a source of heat
|    For life on river shore.
|
| In winter months they paint on skin a whore,
| And every one despite what silence swore.
|     These cycles now repeat
|     While steeples chime upbeat.
| A yearly war for land they all abhor:
|     Their home on river shore.

Kingdoms
--------

| Two children crossed an earthen bridge
| from level lawns to forests wild
| along the rivered arc descending ridge.
| With dirty hands, they sang and smiled.
| their charted map from zippered packs
| now in branches espied its target
| as clearing yields to lily blacks
| their kingdom's fresh air market.
| Lord and lady honorary, cheeked blush,
| sat upon thrones of woven grass,
| coronated by chirping choir thrush;
| a falling grain in hourglass. 
|
| On a maiden morning moments hence,
| they meet again upon the autumn passing,
| where from heart's removed pretense
| on tender lips, farewell's final massing.
| Lily lyrics whisper sing from ground
| reminders of their childish notions;
| World departed, their lives are found
| separate by spanning roads and oceans.
|
| In the city, their trains diverge,
| through tunnels tracked by wagered hours;
| Iron rails through hearts do purge
| their aged minds of lily flowers.
| Winter drifts over concrete streets,
| in the thrush's snow sad song
| delivered them in voice downbeat
| the final dirge of life prolonged.
| In the cold, their dream dissolved
| with the clock's incessant ticking.
| Falling strokes of time resolved;
| they follow home a casket's wicking,
| Returned again to a lilting lily field
| where once royals played for a day;
| With new hearts scored and peeled
| in the funerary cloud of gray,
| in the clearing, coffins buried,
| their eyes met in solitary gaze.
|
| In dirt developed their earthen walls,
| roofed the sky to room above,
| where lord and lady clothed in shawls
| sing the thrushs' songed love.

Elemental Elegy
---------------

| The day I sat by death's grey bed,
| I told a story green and true
| of city bricks stacked proud and red,
| of silver paths the stars imbue
| with golden hue we might have tread,
| your slowing breath as cold as blue.
|
| I spoke the words to yellow skin
| and told of days in white to come.
| Your mouth, with specks of purple grin,
| and fingers stretched so pale and numb,
| my name, you said, so clear, so thin--
| with final grasp, in black succumb.
|
| Oh--Father, Father--brass horns blare!
| You string your harp with diamond thread
| and leave in me this slate despair!
| What crystal tears in eyes now shed?
| What pearl is formed by sightless stare?
| What platinum found in prayers pled?
|
| The oak around your body wraps
| as shoots of pine through spine are grown.
| In loam the roots will bind your scrap
| despite the flowers laid on stone.
| Each time I come a stem I snap,
| for only Earth deserves your bone.

An Ode To Autumn
----------------

| Oh! If I could touch an inch of Autumn
|       And measure Fall in feet,
| I might scale its depths to chart the bottom
|       And feel the Winter heat.
| Alas, no meters mark by foot the path
|       Through wooded maze of trees
|           Where leaves like life will wilt
|               In winded wake of wrath
|           In gusts blown cruel and dumb
|        To lay at feet to span each foot
| The dust each clever leaf here does become.
|
| As seasons pass and cast
|       My bone layered into stone,
| Let August dig for me a grave in brown
|       Barrow beneath her loam.
| Pray not a lover find these shards on shore
|       I am no edge to skip
|           Atop the waves of fancy
|               But under weight sunk roar
|           Where, offset, tides will rise
|       To breach the sodden dike
| And drown with wave the lazing lovers' sigh.
|
| To life I came already old and grim
|           But now the chill sets in;
| Each breath in gasp dispels to steam
|           Of Spring now waning thin.

| scattered geese of spring
| underneath an ancient bridge
| crooked necks grazing
|
| II: Flotsam

| rushing river of evening
| sunset over city

| III: Tower Hill

| the birds roost on you

Photographs of Autumn
---------------------

| These photographs are brittle leaves
|    That fell from trees, that we once caught.
| I press them tender into sleeves
|    Of glass to halt the course of rot.
| Though kept well fed with water shed,
|    They wilt to brown as colors fade.
| No leaf can live beside the bed,
|    Without sunlight that makes the shade.
| Yet even still, though claimed by dust,
|    I keep them hung upon my wall,
| For memory you did entrust
|    Of walk with you through golden Fall.

Walls
-----

| the husk of walls that city shucks
| accumulates and concentrates
| around like rings in ancient trunks
| where measured age with circle gates
| the spiraled line amassed through time,
| deposits buried down substrates.
|
| at summit's crest, the joints are thick
| and licking tongues of moss ascend
| the darkened blocks from quarry hauled
| on buttressed back; these stone suspend
| the garden court where crowds took root
| and grew their plans of walls to tend.
|
| from center peak the wooden slats
| erect the map with tangled fence
| to trace a grid of patchwork yards,
| these charts of dreams in ground commence
| the flattened course of borough life
| where burgs and burbs did once condense.
|
| then moving out, the bricks of red
| in crooked rows descend to meet
| the lanes of carriage tracts now black
| and scorched with tar in shapes of street
| where crimson dust from crumbled walls
| in dancing twirls across concrete.
|
| next grey cement of molded squares
| in towers stacked to portal sky
| with wires fused and humming signs;
| they arc and rise, on edges vie
| these vines entwined in rushing growth
| to split on spine, like nuclei.
|
| at last the stable struts of steel
| designed as straight as rays of light
| reflected back on silver glass
| the lattice links both left and right;
| the history in circled sweep
| constricts the city sphere so tight.
|
| through sections cut an avenue,
| from point to point and time to time,
| the human shell that forms in turn
| in arches bend, in steepled chime,
| that wilts and sheds, its fossils kept
| in barrows made of salt and lime.

|   to say the words unsaid.
|
| A coin from mint, with shine and glint,
|   will catch the eye like you.
| but pockets empty money spent
|   while you in time accrue.
|
| A spoon or fork, a candlestick,
|   much closer still to life,
| these things, like you, are what we pick
|   in times of joy or strife.
|
| A ring is fine, but circles lack
|   geometry divine.
| What shapes are made to trace and track
|   what forms around you twine?
|
| Of silver gifts but one remains:
|   a mirror held to face.
| For only there in glass contains
|   what sets my heart apace.

Father's Lullaby
----------------

| Dear child, the monsters under bed
|   are not just make believe.
| They lurk in shadows overhead
|   and offer no reprieve.
|
| Dear sweetling, sleep with open eye
|   and guard your dreams at night.
| Ignore your mother's lullaby,
|   keep candles burning bright.
|
| Beware the lair that closets hide,
|   the racks of their disguise,
| the suits and ties, the cuffs that slide
|   and cloak them from your eyes.
|
| Fear not the slash of sharpened claws,
|   the flashing terror brief,
| but stamps that mark the written clause
|   with laws of fierce belief.
|
| What evil deeds those stories tell
|   prepare your heart to meet
| the formal world where heroes fell
|   to wander incomplete.

Landscapes
----------

| Oh, hapless world, the butcher's block,
|   The sickle, scythe, harpoon,
| The barren fields, the culled livestock,
|   The blood red harvest moon.
|
| The ocean deep, a darkened heart,
|   A sore that festers cold,
| A slumbered age, a violent art,
|   Into all things behold:
|
| The forests wild, the stalking hunt,
|   The arrow cut from stone,
| The bloody rib, the final grunt,
|   A death in whimpered groan.
|
| The mountain peaks, a falling height,
|   The air in sky dissolved,
| A winter wind, a bitter blight,
|   Let no sin be absolved.
|
| The city streets, the graveyard paths,
|   The linen beds of wards,
| The gowns of white, the final baths,
|   The oak in coffin boards.

The Ballad of the Isle
----------------------

| I - Spring
| 
| I - March (Mutable Water)
|
| The island formed where rivers meet,
|   where silt through vortex fords.
| The place emerged a brokered feat, 
|   a land of met accords.
|
| A mantle crown, in breaching air,
|   the regents all proclaim
| a vessel poured from blooded heir
|   of season's last remain.
|
| So March the army sorties cease,
|   embarking east and west 
| to mark the chartered pact with peace,
|   obeisance paid and blessed.
| 
| Here pairs of fish in lunar sway
|    coordinate their fins
| in swooping ornament display
|    with flocking mirrored twins.
|
| Behold the treaty words in ink,
|   the scrolls in future's brine,
| the sutures binding swords in sync
|   to island's hallow shrine.
|
| II - April (Cardinal Fire)
|
| The webs of Spring such crude affairs
|   when strung with spinning songs;
| the threaded compromise ensnares
|   the spidered plotting throngs. 
|  
| The April session clauses creep
|   and wolves with sharpened claws,
| deceived by strategems of sheep,
|   retract their motioned laws.  
|
| But blurting rams befoul the ploy,
|   with filibuster bleets
| that break the still the ewes enjoy;
|   the argument repeats.
|
| To raven galleries' refrain
|    in rabble squalls of wind,
| they find in mutual disdain
|    their hopes together pinned. 
|
| Elusive votes are overcast 
|   on cloudy ballots posed.
| By noon, the forum order passed
|   conceded plans proposed.
|
| III - May (Fixed Earth)
|
| A barren hump prepared with zeal
|   as sparrows plow their seeds.
| From sprouted weed to plants' reveal
|   through curtains made of reeds. 
|
| The shoots are sunk and water sewn
|   through roots of flooded banks
| where mudded flanks of fish cyclone
|   around the studded ranks. 
| 
| A retinue arrives from sea
|   atop a snow-white bull.
| Its royalty with one decree
|   begins the reign in full.
|
| The trees then stake foundations firm,
|   cement what's broken free, 
| confirm the seed to bring to term
|   the squawking newborn plea.
|
| A birth announced to kneeling crowds
|   in congregation's girth, 
| by May pronounced through sealing clouds
|   of consecrated Earth.
|
| II - Summer
| 
| I - June (Mutable Air)
| 
| When stellar swans survey the dawn
|   of constellated shores,
| their forms in flight are downward drawn
|   towards gravitating cores. 
|
| They veer through plumes of pheromone,
|   converge at silent points.
| Diverging tracts, though yearly grown, 
|   lead back where June annoints.
|
| At last the Summer bursts with life
|   and summons forth its herds
| to open market pastures rife
|   with bounty born by birds. 
|  
| In shallows deer appear to graze
|   beside the lazing drapes
| of rays, the incandescent haze
|   that veils their swaying shapes.
|
| Then maiden buds unfold to bees 
|   their sweetly nectared heat;
| unladen, drowsy, through the breeze,
|   the teasing fumes secrete. 
|
| II - July (Cardinal Water)
|
| Along the flowing inlet streams 
|   the festival begins.
| Caressing music tinges dreams
|   with cricket violins.
|
| Soft underfoot the cancers tap,
|   enrapt by vibrant chords. 
| The snapping prance of shells enwrap
|   the island shore with hordes.
|
| As gondolas of lilies' bud
|   that carry courting toads
| through swampy bogs to ports of mud
|   relieve their tadpole loads.
|
| Oh! Jubilee, this boon, July
|   through fallow leas by moon,
| when rodents swoon in cups of rye 
|   and fall to bed too soon.
|
| Amid the revelry a kiss
|   to memory's delight,
| two larks alight in fading bliss
|   fulfill this final night. 
|
| III - August (Fixed Fire)
|
| What bittersweet perfumes release
|   in looming throes of age,
| when isle matures through orange cerise, 
|   engulfed in scents of sage.
|
| Though leonine its roar in youth,
|   the shedding source of mane
| replies with veins of blood vermouth
|   through suffocating grain.
|
| Of August lines that empire grew,
|   once cloaked in ermine garbs,
| unkempt and molting, flake sinew,
|   their branches wreathed in barbs.
|
| Though riches hide in golden limb,
|   the leaves dissolve to dust,
| consoled in wind to hushing skim
|   what wealth remains in gust. 
|
| Discreetly cloaked from time the Fall
|   of secret reign's decline
| through crimson's spectrum vine, all
|   gone brown, forgetting shine.
|
| III - Autumn
| 
| I - September (Mutable Earth)
|
| September storms suspend the skies
|   resplendent morning pinks
| above the waking window eyes
|   despairing foregone winks. 
| 
| What ears of wheat will balance scales? 
|   What maiden disappears? 
| Condensing answers dance in gales,
|   descending hemispheres.
|
| Now Autumn comes with heavy rain 
|   to test the borders drawn.
| The water drained from level plain
|   in flooding rose the dawn.
|
| The thunder heralds sundered age 
|   besieged by droplets fat 
| with blood of yearly plundered wage, 
|   enraged what Spring begat.   
| 
| What muddy lanes then sluice the drowned
|   debris and sweep from field
| the tumbling tumult, turned aground
|   and heaped by waves to wield.
|
| II - October (Cardinal Air)
|
| Divided sky once halved in poise, 
|   succumbs to blackened press,
| the hours compress to whiter noise
|   in surging strained excess.
|
| October chopping peaks depressed
|   through interlocking weeks
| deplete reserves that Summer stressed
|   to balking vassal shrieks. 
|
| Retreating columns' sullen flight,
|   deserting homes and kin, 
| the fleeing wash through rapids white
|   with waters steeped in sin.
|
| So inch by inch the tides reclaim
|   the island kingdom keep
| and cast it down without a name
|   to swirling depths of sleep.
|
| The atlas page is ripped anew,
|   schematic contour holes
| where once there rose a sprout to blue
|   now rising streams of souls. 
|
| III - November (Fixed Water)
|
| Orion's arrow point is plunged
|   through lunging fronts of hail
| across the waves where life expunged
|   remains through shadowed veil.  
|
| For down below, the stones make schemes
|   in skipping sprees like drunks,
| inlaid in sunken trees through seams
|   as ballast for their trunks.
| 
| Arise the turret towers stark
|   against the ruddered land 
| to touch the ceiling shuttered dark
|   and brace what sprawling spanned. 
|
| Beneath the surface flowers form
|   as shades of algae grow
| atop the castle walls in swarm,
|   the borough glade aglow.
|
| November's embers burn a while
|   between the exiled graves.
| Remembered nocturnes sung beguile
|   the damned, forgottten knaves. 
|
| IV - Winter
|
| I - December (Mutable Fire)
|
| A rending gale begins to blow
|   above where worlds still thrive.
| Descending sickles diving slow
|   as primal ends arrive.
|
| Let Winter lens of crystal glass
|   behold submerged the fast,
| alive with dancing ghosts en masse
|   retreading paths now past. 
|
| Its poison stings but lacks the kill,
|   the sweet paralysis
| of time stood still in languid chill
|   around the palaces. 
|
| The stasis holds in cold command 
|   the surface wraiths in play. 
| They turn to gems, encased expand
|   beyond the skinned decay. 
|
| Dissolved December center breaks, 
|   dismembered lattice links,
| upending states, revolving wakes;
|   the idle spirit shrinks. 
| 
| II - January (Cardinal Earth)
|
| The horns of plenty now cry a dirge
|   as prying cold enfolds
| the last remains from island's purge 
|   outcast from stable moulds.
|
| Through sieging vortices of shard
|    the kingdom yard is cleaved.
| Bombarding sheets of ice discard
|    in circles ruins sieved.
|
| What moments held in spells now spent
|   impels the course of freeze.
| The towers brought to knees repent,
|   now felled by Time's disease.
| 
| The afterlife morassed in cracks
|   of marrow twisted blue,
| the wighted bones of zodiacs
|   imbued with pallid hue.
|
| So seconds pass eternally,
|   this January clock.
| The island keep returns to sea
|   through grains of sand to chalk.
|
| III - February (Fixed Air)
|
| From south, the scouting vees of geese,
|    with probes of swiveled neckcd 
| that follow fronts of warmth's caprice,
|    are promise-held in check.
|
| When Spring returns the tides recede,
|   but hollow urns are filled. 
| The ashes spill through snaking weed,
|   a year of life distilled. 
| 
| For February always brings 
|   the forest chorus lines,
| the chirping chickadee that sings 
|   from luted bows and vines. 
|
| The overflows, Ambrosia wine,
|   Elysian cups of dust,
| from Earth unfroze the redesign
|   of missions more robust.
|
| The angel beaks of birds baptize
|   the dirt in streaking aisle.
| The cycle arcs in sharp reprise:
|   the ballad of the isle.

Roundels of Remembrance
-----------------------

| I - Photographs
|
| A photograph of strangers' joy
| atop the garbage, torn in half.
| though lost, these ghosts in gloss deploy
|   a photograph. 
|
| Imagine tears that joyous laugh,
| the Autumn gowns and corduroy,
| a wedding banquet monograph.
|
| With age then mixed precise alloy
| from parts romance and epitaph,
| til future hands at last destroy
|   a photograph.
|
| II - Walls
|
| Graffitied walls of yearly bloom
| with vagrant spray of aerosols;
| The vapors fume, condense and groom
|   graffitied walls. 
|
| The artists follow protocols:
| the lover's name, the prophet's doom,
| the epigraphs of homeless sprawls.
|
| The rarer buds of sweet perfume
| are hidden deep in alley malls
| where flowered faces sprung consume
|   graffitied walls. 
|
| III - Air
| 
| The fragrant air which wavers here
| in heat like harps of golden hair
| that sweep their shoulder length to clear
|   the fragrant air.
|
| The lily sermons whisper where
| I heard your blood through skin by ear,
| a moment made in silent stare. 
|
| The scent remains, you disappear,
| as wind now speaks your name in prayer,
| in razor gusts that whip and shear
|   the fragrant air.
| 
| IV - Ink
| 
| In fading ink, her fine details
| like curly cues and shades of pink,
| the shadowed lines that leak through trails
|   in fading ink.
|
| A paper mind she wrote to think, 
| so words replace what breath inhales
| and find my thoughts with hers in sync. 
|
| In letters light as chapel veils,
| I watch our dance as bodies sink,
| a final gasp of life exhales 
|   in fading ink.
|
| V - Seats
|
| The vinyl seats of classic cars,
| the plastic smell their thread secretes,
| this cherry burn on cover mars 
|   the vinyl seats.
|
| When Father stooped to sew the sheets,
| his needles stacked in columned jars,
| his fingers folded rows of pleats.
|
| My fingers trace the wells of scars
| as driving down the city streets
| my careless dropped reminder chars
|   the vinyl seats.

The Pantoums of Dementia
------------------------

| Movement I - Undulation
|
| the seconds slowed to stop as Father passed,
| when flocking sons returned to home to mourn,
| then Mother's mind began to break at last  
| as moments shed in threads she once had worn. 
| 
| when flocking sons returned to home to mourn, 
| recast in lensing rays of age amassed 
| as moments shed in threads she once had worn
| the Father's sons adorned with clothes outcast. 
|
| recast in lensing rays of age amassed 
| a question, Mother, may I have a dance? 
| the Father's sons adorned with clothes outcast
| an offered hand through loops of time's expanse.
| 
| a question, Mother, may I have a dance? 
| their Father knelt and tender took her hand,
| an offered hand through loops of time's expanse,
| their final words in wilting hearts expand.
|
| their Father knelt and tender took her hand,
| the seconds slowed to stop as Father passed,
| their final words in wilting hearts expand, 
| then Mother's mind began to break at last. 
|
| Movement II - Rearrangement
|
| remember now before the future fades, 
| the sutured minutes of memories held,
| records replayed as grooving sound degrades,
| advancing echoes, music notes dispelled. 
| 
| the sutured minutes of memories held:
| now twirling dance, oh younger selves, entrance
| advancing echoes, music notes dispelled
| through silent waltz that swells with last romance. 
|
| now twirling dance, oh younger selves, in trance
| with candled spells of woven hands that grasp
| through silent waltz that swells with last romance
| of eyes reshaping molds, the fated clasp. 
| 
| with candled spells of woven hands that grasp
| relapsing moments sung by bells and crowds
| of eyes, reshaping molds the fated clasp 
| of past refrains now sealed beneath the clouds. 
|
| relapsing moments sung by bells and crowds
| concealed by crumbling walls, demented shades
| of past refrains now sealed beneath these clouds
| that clutter skies in swarms that stretch decades.
|
| concealed by crumbling walls, demented shades
| (remember now before the future fades)
| invade the hollowed mind as scream pervades
| records replayed as grooving sound degrades.
|
| Movement III - Dissolution
|
| remember ancillary note sentries:
| the good can decay many ways.
| phantom morrow's cough. in times realize
| the mention there of tenant seasons.
|
| the good candy came anyways;
| all target the damaged mind in trance,
| (the men shun their often antsy sons)
| the flow ingrained decomposes.
|
| altar, get the damn aged mind, entrance
| memory erstwhile, foe kissing;
| the flowing rain eddy composes
| another ushered 
|
| memo rehearsed while focusing
| an aim, wintry slight, upward ingrown
| an other us heard 
| the fading names of suns.
|
| a name when trees light up, warding grown
| remembrance, ill airy notes in trees,
| the fading names of sons
| fan tomorrow's coffin, time's real eyes.

Rejection Letters 
-----------------

.. epigraph::

  This rejection is in regards to "The Pantoums of Dementia." We're so sorry we could not bring you better news; we know firsthand how difficult it is to put yourself and your writing out there.

  These were some of the critiques that our team had for “The Pantoums of Dementia”:

  “While I love this collection, their meanings, and their structures, I do not feel the average reader will connect strongly with these pieces. The lines are a little convoluted, which is evidently intentional, but I feel the audience will grow frustrated with it, rather than engage further.”

  “This is a really interesting approach, and I got chills at the end of the first poem. I'm not sure the third is as strong, but I also think the disjunct nature/images and change in voice/word choice are very fitting when you consider the subject. I think that viewed as a whole, this is a powerful piece.”

  “The language used does not appeal to me nor makes this easy to digest for the common reader. I love the concept of this poem and find it unique, but it does not fully immerse me.”

  “I like the pantoum form, but it's very tricky to do well and not get frustrated with the repetition. Dementia is a clever way to use repetition, but the elevated vocabulary matched with formal structure distances the emotion of the poem. I'd recommend trying a more colloquial tone in the pantoum form.”

  Overall, we did enjoy your submission and encourage you to submit again!

Ode to the Heron
----------------

| Grey Heron, sing the song the winds will bring.
| Who lingers longer than the Winter king?  
|
| When hunting ground returns
|       through fronts of blue to ice,
| the moles in burrowed urns
|       prepare beside the mice.
| The grunting geese then veer
|       where churning warmth is drove.
| The deer all disappear
|       through dreary dreaming cove.
|
| All yield, retreat and leave their claims till Spring.
| Through fields, what muffled name on streams will ring?
|
| The answer sweeps from east--
|       Oh! Heron! Hunter Grey! 
| Cry! Rouse the sleeping beast
|       and reaping, feast on prey!
| Creep low on drift of snow
|       with coiled neck of spear;
| Let steam of gasping slow
|       their rasping scream of fear.
|
| The weather warms, yet Winter lifts your wing.
| The feathers swarm, but lone to cold you cling.
|
| In flocking song most birds
|       find mate to take to nest;
| Let chorus part the herds
|       with fire from thumping chest,
| your pumping flame that spurns
|       the burning cold on flank.
| Your silent stare discerns
|       the creatures left on bank.
|
| Each season makes of life a shape to wring.
| Each reason born in strife escapes to sing. 
|
| The Spring first strings the thread
|       of lazy chirping thrush,
| the Summer, berry red
|       and cracking eggs in brush,
| then Autumn crows of black
|       in pecking pumpkin hay.
| Only a lonely lack
|       breeds mighty Heron Grey.
|
| When night descends, take stock of everything.
| What hidden home should find you nuzzling?
|
| What branches bear your weight?
|       Whose feathers stroke your beak?
| No human eyes await
|       the colony's mystique. 
| The shrieking calls coalesce
|       atop the forest heights,
| in alien address
|       the flame inside ignites.

The Law of Duality
------------------

| The world we lived that I once knew
|     (If one could know these fevered dreams)
| I've tried my hand unsticking you
|     (These fingers stick to broken seams)
| It sticks to me and sticks like glue
|     (Like noose and neck that swing from beams)
| 
| To every thought a thought before
|     (To make of me a puppet string)
| And every point contains much more
|     (But only hollow things can ring)
| While every center holds a core
|     (Yet even empty space can sing)
|
| A million words and more to come
|     (I'd weep to know a single fact)
| These humming beats through syntax thrum
|     (Where waves reflect their heights subtract)
| In hopes a word will angle plumb
|     (Refracted rays in lines contract)
|
| This image pressed through sieve to mold
|     (The words I speak are cracked by heat)
| These holes that craft the shapes to hold
|     (No shapeless things are written neat)
| The world retold in paper fold
|     (What's left of life in crumpled sheet?)

Gravity
-------

| The mind, it breaks, and falls to parts.
| As father died, he spoke in tongues
| of shifting walls and gravity
| that sideways pulled the world to parts. 
|
| The mind, it shakes, and all departs.
| As mother lost her lonely thoughts
| she spoke to walls, soliloquy
| that inward rolled as world departs.
|
| The mind, it's fakeness poisons hearts.
| As nightshade petals float to floors
| by walls that seep humanity,
| the crumbled worlds of poisoned hearts. 
| 
| The mind, it wakes, in fits and starts.
| As thoughts now lay me down to sleep
| the walls will shift and speak to me
| that upside down my ending starts.

Absurdity
---------

| One lovely Thursday afternoon
|   two billion years ago,
| A star encased by arcs of moon,
|   embraced despair and woe. 
| 
| This sordid joke of yellow-red,
|    This sneering, mocking jape:
| To burn with heat, on axis sped
|    with no hope of escape.
|
| So solace cursed upon a point,
|    it drew its final plan
| As spinning round its lock and joint
|    its ending now began.
| 
| The heaving mass of goo morassed
|    then gurgled once and sighed;
| A rattle scream of flames harassed
|    what silent void belied. 
| 
| The sacrificial rings were flung
|   in sprays across the sky;
| The interstitial threads then wrung
|   as ropes once bound untie. 
|
| And in these fictions fracture facts:
|    A single atom forged
| and bellow blown through heaven's tracts
|    to find itself disgorged. 
| 
| The crush of black, once unobserved,
|    in fire found its sight.
| The atom woke from dreams unnerved
|    in sailing stream of flight. 
| 
| Without a frame, it screamed in vain
|    through parallactic curves
| that weave the sieves with cluttered skein
|    Of dark galactic nerves. 
|
| Commotion drowned, it gazed about
|    along the ends it aimed:
| The bluest gem beyond a doubt
|    the cosmos ever named. 
| 
| It wept to see a brilliant Earth,
|    the fate bestowed by chance,
| and in its cackles rose a mirth
|    expressed in photon's dance. 
|
| It splashed the surface spinning fast,
|    now lost amid the sea. 
| The water rose at what trespassed,
|    mistook it for debris.
|
| The liquid swarm convened in waves,
|    to flood the tiny core.
| They stripped and pried, as hunger craves
|    and always wants for more. 
|
| The terror flashed, as pulled apart,
|   its briefly tasted life
| now disappeared before its start 
|   beneath the wetted knife. 
|
| So bittersweet and incomplete, 
|   resigned into the black,
| the atom braced for ends to meet 
|   in swirling last attack.
|
| But fortune finds where will converged,
|   as snatched from death it gasped
| and saw from depths the land emerged,
|   where brethren all were clasped.
|
| A molecule of carbon made
|   from crystal network cast
| through jointed links of atom braid
|   that helix ghosts amassed. 
|
| Began the age of afterbirths, 
|   of structure spat in space,
| originating blest on Earth's
|   atomic interface. 
|
| Now watch along the webbing sewn
|   the single atom weave
| Through warps and wefts and whetted stone,
|   the knits of stellar sleeve.

Holly Tree
----------

| Under the holly tree
| bough of berries,
| its siren red
| temptation.
|
| Where life began
| on skinny knees
| retching out 
| my guts.
|
| Waxy saw-tooth skin, 
| prickly leaves, 
| the sickly buds 
| of poison seeds.
|
| The tangy tongue
| of Christmas
| funerary rites.
| 
| I spewed
| through chrysalis,
| entrails slick 
| with acid grease,
| thickly dripping
| afterbirth.
|
| Gazed upon by 
| ageless tree,
| received in holy 
| communion, my first 
| memory:
| 
| The pluming rack
| of tight blue
| veins
| that hung about
| my neck.
|
| The womb of black
| that forked
| the branching
| Earth.
|
| The world that hid
| in bitter leaves
| and pushed me
| into it. 
|
| I made a wreath 
| of holly limbs
| to prick my head
| with thoughts. 
|
| I keep its berries
| bright as death
| and touch the skin
| that baptized
| me.

.. epigraph::
  
  Grant,

  Thank you for sending us Holly Tree and for sharing the thought behind your work in your cover letter. Your ambition to explore ritual as profane baptism and transformation came through more clearly with that framing.

  That said, without the context of your note, the connection to ritual felt less apparent to us. Even with the added insight, we still felt the theme didn’t come through on the page as strongly as we were hoping for this issue. While we admired the striking imagery—especially the way the holly tree serves as a powerful central motif—it ultimately wasn’t the right fit for our Ritual call.

  We’re grateful for the chance to read your work and encourage you to submit to us again in the future.

  -- Warm regards, Neon and Smoke

Floods
------

| the lifting waves
| of driftwood floods
|
| the flooding drifts
| of floral wastes
|
| a flowered wage
| that rivers claim
|
| on plains that drive
| the veins to sea 
|
| a ceaseless purge
| through slurried nights 
|
| the slightest sprout
| is rooted out
|
| through shooting streams
| that water loots 
|
| the slaughter lurks
| below riptides
|
| but tides recede
| with grating speed
| 
| and petal graves 
| in gravel pits
|
| unravel green
| with dreams of Spring

Depths
------

| The delicate kiss
| of stillness
| on fingertips.
|
| I linger
| on the precipice
| of surface 
| tension.
| 
| Pallid brine
| eagerly lapping 
| with organic clarity.
|
| An instant 
| before
| the sightless 
| plunge.
| 
| The delirium
| of forgotten
| beginnings. 
| 
| The water
| remembers
| my blood.

Rails
-----


| i yearn for motion's pull and thrust
| the thunder pulse of engine churn
| 
| the pensive burn of ember coals
| i coax the sentry furnace west
| 
| i press the pure and tempered coke
| the poker tamps the pyre nest
| 
| the piled flame that prods the spokes
| i smoke through stops and tile plains
| 
| i'm riding tracks to mountaintops
| from ground to tip that cracks the sky
| 
| the circles arc around the trails
| i'm bound to rails that skirt my heart

The Myth of Geese
-----------------

| the royal flock across the river banks
| in molting courts proclaim the summer theirs,
| its peasant fields now owned by inner ranks
| of scheming birds engaged in crude affairs.
| 
| a secret circle forms the noble core,
| the princelings graze, reposed on flowing knolls.
| as sentry towers hiss away the poor 
| and watch the ground in swiveled neck patrols.
| 
| they chase the beggars pecking fields for seed,
| these pegasi that charge with flightless wings,
| dominion boundless as their princelings' greed.
| the empire hunger breeds the feathered kings.
| 
| the heralds honk their liege with trumpet tongue 
| and sing the myth of geese to gosling young.

August
======

One Misty Morn
--------------

| One misty morn of summer days
| when clouds collected futures sworn.
| From mountaintops descended haze
|       one misty morn.
| 
| That day a dress of green was worn
| while sky dissolved in liquid grays,
| I took your hand and we were born.
| 
| The sun reclaimed our world with rays,
| dispersed the fog, revealed a thorn.
| The fated prick dispelled the daze
|       one misty morn.

Dinner Wine
-----------

| The dinner wine of nervous dates
| once grew upon a Summer vine.
| The Autumn wind now hushed awaits
|       the dinner wine. 
|
| Beneath the Winter's pure moonshine,
| our words distill like concentrates 
| til fingers find yours under mine. 
|
| A taste of Spring now circulates 
| as starry arcs began decline,
| the final drop that dedicates 
|       the dinner wine.

Little Sprout
-------------

| Oh, little sprout, the forest sleeps
| in arid ground now cursed by drought.
| Across the land, the desert sweeps,
|       oh, little sprout. 
| 
| Your boldness lacks a water spout
| but hidden root in darkness steeps
| the moisture buried deep in doubt. 
|
| The dream of Spring nobody keeps 
| ascends in stems so small and stout 
| when mourning sky beholding weeps,
|       oh, little sprout.

Imaginary Vessels
-----------------

| oh name of names, 
| break me into pieces.
| scatter me across these shores.
| let me linger in the tides,
| in the motion of the waves.
|
| the infinite horizon
| condenses into 
| licks of white foam
| on sparkling beaches.
| 
| shatter me into glass,
| slivered lunar shards.
| cast me into the deep
| to curve like lightning 
| across the geometry of the sea.
| 
| i am a million currents,
| the invisible riptide.
| every moment is an ebb
| within the flowing whole.
|  
| the cruel logic of time
| flows through the 
| phases of the moon.
| let me roar and hiss 
| through lightless nights
| as the tidal ages pass. 
| 
| though my bones are Earth,
| my blood was made from water
| and when my flesh is ground again,
| to the ocean i shall return.
|
| from nothing we are shaped;
| every image is a metaphor
| for the void inside.
| 
| our hearts are imaginary,
| like the shape of water
| that fills every vessel.

Millenial Melodies
------------------

| the slow motion
| lives of trees
| in the forest depths.
| empires of pine
| wage ancient wars
| against city-states of oak.
| an insurgency of maple
| hides in their midst,
| gathering at their trunks,
| the nascent rebellion
| that unwinds over centuries.
|
| morning dew soaks 
| the soft slick bark
| of the frozen sentinels
| and paints with strokes
| measured in years
| the green of pungent
| moldy spores.
|
| here a pile of stones,
| millenia old,
| hewn from a mountain.
| the jagged edges of
| its primordial eruption
| softened by quiet eons,
| now draped with pagan cloaks
| of forest magic,
| the altars of secret
| divinations,
| pooling with the blood
| of moss. 
|
| the harmonic revolutions 
| of parallel life, 
| the millenial melodies
| converging into a chorus
| of now.

The Origin of Lies
------------------

| Oh, Ila, don't be weeping,
|    my dear, you misconstrue;
| The sun is only sleeping
|    before it rises new.
|
| I'll wait with you til morning,
|    and tell you of the stars,
| the memories adorning
|    the empty night with scars. 
|
| This love that's learned by lacking,
|    whose vastness has no chart,
| in silent orbits tracking
|    the shaping of your heart. 
|
| Please trust that nothing passes,
|    we only change our form.
| Your tears transmute to gasses 
|    when sun returns to warm.
|
| Child, listen, though you're growing,
|    some things cannot be known
| until you've grown up knowing
|    out here you're all alone.
|
| I'll be with you forever,
|    these words will be a lie.
| If I could but this deliver:
|    To live until you die.
|
| So while you're small, keep holding
|    my hand as though it soothes,
| The world will keep unfolding
|   each wrinkle that it smoothes.
|
| Believe me when I'm saying:
|    Oh, Ila, darling dear,
| No matter what I'm staying,
|    I'll always be right here.

Larksong 
--------

| at least the larks remember songs
| each morning rise you're gone again.
| 
| the mourning veils of scattered throngs 
| depart your wake without amen.
| 
| the men who take your parts away
| forget to take my silent heart.
|
| they leave a lily black bouquet
| whose petals fingers tear apart.
| 
| and when i stand alone in pain,
| the stems are bare and nothing's changed. 
| 
| the birds begin their last refrain
| as though they knew and prearranged.
| 
| if nothing else, their voice belongs;
| at least the larks remember songs.

Eulogy
------

| mound of the earth, the funeral pyre,
| sermons of fire, infernos of oak.
|
| burning of briars, spiraling higher,
| chorus expired and softly I spoke:
|
| nothing is left, but cinders remain,
| warm to the touch, as memories fade. 
| 
| look to the thrashing showers of rain,
| mourn with the hissing coils arrayed.
| 
| pound for the taking, body of ash,
| weight of the flame, transmuted to wind. 
| 
| thundering blacks, the cymbals that crash,
| scavenging clouds, vultures descend.
| 
| weep with the water, falling to feet,
| honor your father, drink of his heat.

Windfall
--------

| if every word is written on the wind
| then every sentence grows into a storm. 
| 
| so when you breathed my breath, then gasped and grinned,
| in fronts the future gales began to form.
| 
| and when you spoke, that tempest swelled to swarm,
| converging now to sweep my thoughts away
| 
| right back to where our swirling words perform,
| around our promise howling disarray.
|
| our fate is spelled in thunder struck display,
| in lightning arcs the clouds now ionize. 
| 
| my every breath is filled with yesterday,
| each passing sigh is mixed with our demise.
| 
| the silent rain begins to tell our tale.
| in shallow breaths, your words i still inhale. 

Crystal and Glass
----------------------

| i glue my heart of broken glass.
| refracted rays of you contract
| along the fractures breaks amass. 
|
| we fell in love upon the grass,
| a perfect shattered artifact.
| i glue my heart of broken glass.
|
| the lake was waving evening brass
| reflected in your eyes exact
| along the fractures breaks amass.
| 
| we shared the scent of sassafras
| as water braced for sun's impact.
| i glue my heart of broken glass.
|
| the summer lapped its final pass
| and left the surface still and cracked
| along the fractures breaks amass.
|
| in dreams, these grounds i will trespass
| to find their core, and shards extract.
| i glue my heart of broken glass
| along the fractures breaks amass.
