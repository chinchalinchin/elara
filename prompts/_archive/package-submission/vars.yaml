  wildscape. literary journal is an online literary & art magazine celebrating poetry, fiction, nonfiction, & art. We are a blend of whimsy & chaos, and are looking for pieces that have strong imagery, creative wordplay, indulgent metaphors, & mic drop endings. We want to question whether or not you're sane. We want to question whether or not we're sane. We welcome simultaneous submissions, & we nominate for both the Pushcart Prize & Best of the Net. We can't wait to see what you've got.
  
  ****PLEASE READ ALL GENRE-SPECIFIC AND GENERAL GUIDELINES BEFORE MAKING A SUBMISSION - We are a small team and following our guidelines helps us IMMENSELY. I know it's a lot of information, but if you are asking that we read and consider your work, we are asking that you take the time to read over what we need in order for us to keep this process as efficient as possible. Thank you! <3

  COST:
  -To submit work: free! We do not charge for general submissions. We do allow tips though (for which we are eternally grateful), and we do offer expedited responses for certain tip amounts:
  -Expedited Response in <48 hours: $5+
  -Expedited Response in <24 hours: $8+
  **Expedited Responses can be paid for as a tip on the tip jar page of the submission process. A $5+/$8+ tip will automatically initiate the expedited process.

  ***If Duosuma is not accessible to you for any reason, or if it's giving you trouble, feel free to submit to us via Google Forms, or via email instead at wildscapelit@gmail.com.
  -If you choose to submit via Google Forms, all main/important guidelines are within the Google Form, so no need to read anything below.
  -If you choose to submit via email: Attach your work to the email as a .doc/.docx for writing, and whatever works best for art. Please include the following in the body of the email: a short third-person bio (<75 words), your preferred pronouns, country in which you reside (city and/or state too if you'd like to share), and how you heard about us. This method of submitting will not affect when we get back to you, nor will it affect our decision regarding your work. We understand that email is much easier for some people, and respect your choice to submit work via email, no matter the reason.

  GENRE-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES (general guidelines are below the genre-specific guidelines):

  *POETRY*

  -Up to 5 poems

  -12pt font, times new roman

  -Upload only as .doc/.docx (NOT a PDF, unless the formatting of your poetry requires a PDF)

  -PLEASE submit all poems in ONE DOCUMENT. DO NOT submit one document per poem. Doing this will delay our response time, as your poems will then be split up between readers/editors.

  -Each poem must be two pages or shorter

  -Please start each poem on a new page and be sure that the titles for each poem are clearly marked (in italics, bold, underlined, whatever)

  -Please leave all identifying information (name, address, email address, etc.) off of your submission document itself (including the title). We prefer to read blind (i.e. not knowing who the author is).

  -Hard sells: rhyming poetry, overly-sexual poetry for the sake of being overly-sexual, horror, vulgarity for the sake of being vulgar (i.e. it must have a purpose or add something to the poem).

  -We strongly recommend checking out our most recent quarterly/regular issue to get an idea of what type of work we enjoy.

  .

  *FLASH FICTION/FLASH CREATIVE NONFICTION*

  -Up to 2 pieces

  -12pt font, times new roman, double spaced

  -Please keep each piece under 1,500 words

  -Upload only as .doc/.docx (NOT a PDF), with each story in its own document.

  -Please leave all identifying information (name, address, email address, etc.) off of your submission document itself (including the title). We prefer to read blind (i.e. not knowing who the author is).

  -We strongly recommend checking out our previous issues to get an idea of what type of work we enjoy.

  .

  .

  *ART*

  Please send up to ten pieces of art. We prefer the whimsical and the beautiful, the ethereal and the wild. We love abstract, as well as any and all mediums/techniques. Genre does not matter, but we tend to lean away from horror and nude photography. You are also welcome to submit your work to us via email at wildscapelit@gmail.com if that is easiest for you.

  GENERAL GUIDELINES & INFORMATION:

  -Third-Person Bio: Please keep your bio under 75 words.

  -Languages We Accept: We can only accept work written in predominantly English, though work with words/phrases in other languages is absolutely welcome. Translations are welcome, provided you have permission to use the original work and can provide the author's name of the original work.

  -Previous Contributors: We ask that contributors of the most recent regular issue skip one submission period before submitting work again, but this does not apply to art contributors, nor does it apply to contributors published in a themed issue.

  -Multiple Submissions: We ask that you do not submit work more than two times in any submission period (this goes for across genres as well). Please wait on a response to your first submission before making a second submission.

  -Cover Letters: A cover letter is NOT required and will not affect our decision, as we will not read it until after seeing your work. However, we always enjoy learning a little about you, and welcome any information you'd like to share with us about you and/or your work.

  -Simultaneous Submissions: Simultaneous submissions are more than welcome (and expected). In fact, we encourage them! All we ask is that you notify us ASAP if a piece has been accepted for publication elsewhere. You can withdraw the specific piece from your submission, leave us a note/message in Duosuma, or email us directly (wildscapelit@gmail.com) if you need to withdraw a submission or a piece of a submission.

  -Previously Published Work: We do not accept previously published work (we do NOT count social media posts as previously published, so send those in!). We will make exceptions for works that were published in print-only publications, or in publications that no longer exist (but please let us know in your cover letter if this is the case).

  -Compensation: Unfortunately, since we are a small team, a new indie magazine, and donâ€™t charge for submissions, we are unable to pay our contributors at this time (but we hope to in the future). We do, however, nominate for both the Pushcart Prize and Best of the Net, as well as Best New Poets, O. Henry Prize, and Best Small Fiction.

  -Response Time: We do our best to get back to you with a decision within 2-3 weeks, but depending on how busy we are, it may take up to a month. Please contact us if you have not heard back from us within 30 days.

  -WE DO NOT ACCEPT: Hateful words of any kind (if you need clarification on this, then we might not be for you). We believe that black lives matter, that the people of Palestine & Sudan & the Congo & Haiti & all other oppressed populations/nations deserve to be free, & that love is love is love. If you send work that enables the oppression of any marginalized people, you will be banned from making future submissions. We reserve the right to rescind acceptance/publication of your work if it is found that you are expressing hate towards any oppressed/marginalized groups. We also do not accept work that has been created using AI in any capacity.
