  The Body Archive

  We carry what’s been carved into us—scars, secrets, the strange souvenirs of survival. For our upcoming issue, we want stories, poems, and hybrids that unearth the horror of embodiment. Think haunted anatomy, sentient scars, inherited monstrosity. Is your skin a map or a mask? Show us where it hurts, and how it changes you.

  **Submissions are OPEN from August 2nd - October 15th @ 11:59 p.m. e.s.t.**

  Important Guidelines

  Microsoft Word Documents are no longer supported. Please use Google Doc links or PDFs.
  Please keep in mind word counts: 300-600 words for flash-fiction and non-fiction, 1000 words for short-story submissions.
  Submissions that do not follow the theme (listed above) will get an automatic rejection.
  Photography + Visual Art submissions: an artist's statement is VERY helpful to our reviewers.
  Submission Withdrawals: Please do not send these to the CDJ email; it might get missed. Do so via Duosuma instead.
  Check out our FAQ page if you have a question; it might be listed there. If not, do email us and we will do our best to assist you.
  Tip Jar

  Tips are optional but deeply appreciated! They help us cover hosting and design costs so we can keep creating this space for writers and artists. Thank you for your support!

  Poetry in any form or style. Your poetry submission may contain up to three to five (3-5) poems, may be submitted as one file, run fewer than 10 pages in length, and must be unpublished. Please start each poem on a new page on your document. Title your poems OR specify ‘Untitled’ at the top of the document. Simultaneous submissions are welcomed so long as you withdraw them when accepted elsewhere.
