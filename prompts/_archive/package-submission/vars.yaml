  January House is a meeting place for diverse expressions, urgent conversations, and the ever-evolving landscapes of contemporary literature and art. We invite you to join us in shaping a publication that honors both craft and curiosity, rooted in a belief that storytelling, in all its forms, matters.


  About
  At January House, we believe in the transformative power of language and image. Our purpose is to create a space where poetry, prose, and visual art can challenge, inspire, and connect — across boundaries of form, genre, and experience.

  We are committed to publishing work that reflects the wide spectrum of human voices. We welcome submissions from writers and artists of all backgrounds, identities, and levels of experience. Whether raw or refined, traditional or experimental, intimate or political, we seek work that speaks with authenticity and intention.

  Our pages are open to the quiet and the bold, the tender and the fierce. We are drawn to pieces that ask questions, take risks, and offer new ways of seeing the world and ourselves. We are especially interested in work that resists easy categorization and invites readers into a deeper engagement with language and art.

  Ultimately, January House is a meeting place — for diverse expressions, urgent conversations, and the ever-evolving landscapes of contemporary literature and art. We invite you to join us in shaping a publication that honors both craft and curiosity, rooted in a belief that storytelling, in all its forms, matters.
