  DASH Literary Journal
 

  DASH is back!
  After a hiatus, DASH is returning with our next expected publication in late spring of 2026.  

  Published annually, DASH Literary Journal is based out of the California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) Department of English, Comparative Literature, and Linguistics.  DASH is created through a class entitled English 515: Proofreading, Editing, & Journal Production. This unique aspect brings a team of editors together to curate the submissions that DASH receives, which allows each submission to receive more attention (typically 3-4 readers) than many literary journals. The team of editors also design all facets of the journal.  

  Open to general submissions since 2008, DASH has published national and international poetry, fiction, creative non-fiction, micro-literary criticism, hybrid texts, and artwork by authors and artists of all levels of experience, from first-time submitters through well-published creators.

  While the works themselves cover a diverse range of topics, themes, and styles, successful DASH submissions are brief, concentrated expressions of creativity, with an emphasis on brevity.

  Brandi Wells (bwells@fullerton.edu) is the Faculty Adviser. Please email them with any questions, but note that submissions must be made through the submission manager link listed below.  

  

  Our regular reading period is now open and closes March 1. Decisions will be made by May with a late spring publication.  

  Submissions will only be accepted through the submission site.
