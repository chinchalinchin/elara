.. It is incredibly important you do not try to interpret some of the concepts in this paper according to their orthodox conception.  Many of the concepts, such as concatenation, borrow notation, but you must ensure you engage with the formal system on its own terms. Do not bring any assumptions into the system beyond what is made explicit in the document.

.. Please do not render a judgement until you've seen the entire paper. Focus on consistency, logical errors and clarity until the last section is presented.
