General Rules
-------------

If ever in doubt as to the transliteration of a Philadelphian term into English, the following rules should be applied to arrive at an approximation.

1. Rule 1: The "A" Split

- **Rule**: a → ay-a (when it comes before an m, n, f, s, or th sound)
- **Explanation**: The short "a" sound, as in "cat," often becomes a two-part tense vowel.
- **Examples**: class → clay-ass, half → hay-af, pass → pay-ass.
- **Exceptions**: This rule also applies to the words mad, bad, and glad, but crucially, not to sad. This is why mad and sad do not rhyme.

2. Rule 2: The "O" Fronting

- **Rule**: Long o → e-o
- **Explanation**: The vowel in a word like "go" is "fronted," meaning it's produced more towards the front of the mouth.
- **Examples**: go → ge-o, no → ne-o.
- **Exceptions**: This does not apply when the vowel is followed by an 'l', so goal remains unchanged.

3. Rule 3: The "Ow" Fronting

- **Rule**: ow/ou → e-ow
- **Explanation**: Similar to the long "o," the vowel sound in "down" is also fronted.
- **Examples**: down → de-own, mouth → me-owth.

4. Rule 4: The Raised "Aw"

- **Rule**: aw/off/augh → aw-uh
- **Explanation**: The vowel in "coffee" or "caught" is raised and pronounced as a diphthong (a two-part sound). This preserves the difference between words like cot and caught.
- **Examples**: coffee → caw-uh-fee, soft → saw-uhft, caught → caw-uht.

5. Rule 5: The "On" Shift

- **Rule**: on → awn
- **Explanation**: The word "on" is pronounced to rhyme with "dawn," not "don."
- **Example**: "Turn the lights awn."
