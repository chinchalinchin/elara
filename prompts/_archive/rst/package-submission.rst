SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
The Garfield Lake Review is an annual literary and visual arts magazine established in 1971. Editorial selections, magazine design, and layout are all completed by The University of Olivet students in Michigan. We are primarily interested in publishing work from our college community, but we will consider work from talented writers and artists beyond the immediate community. We encourage writers and artists to review previous issues of the magazine before submitting work. 


This year's theme is “Grief and Recovery." Grief takes many forms. It can arrive suddenly or unfold slowly over time. It might be tied to the loss of a person, a place, yourself, or something less easily named. Recovery, too, is not a single path, but a rocky road, a reimagining of life after loss. For the 2026 issue, we invite work that explores the vast landscape of grief and/or recovery. Pieces may focus solely on the ache of absence, the disorientation of change, the sharp edges of sorrow. Or they may lean into the fragile, powerful, steps toward healing. Some may hold both grief and recovery in tension; others may rest entirely in one. We are not seeking neat conclusions. We are seeking truth; in whatever shape it takes. 

Submissions open September 7th, 2025.​

The submission deadline for the 2025 edition is September 27, 2025.

The 2026 Spring edition will be published in April of 2026. 

​

If you do not already have a Duotrope account, you will be prompted to create one when you click Submit. The account is free.

​

The print version of the magazine is available in April and is free for contributors upon request and for members of the college community; contributors outside of the continental U.S. will receive a digital copy or may pay shipping for a hard copy. All others may acquire a copy ($15) through emailing the advisor, Elizabeth Trueblood (ETrueblood@uolivet.edu).

**Public submissions close September 27th, 2025**

**University of Olivet submisisons close October 1st, 2025**

The Garfield Lake Review prides itself in accepting a wide selection of fiction, poetry, and visual arts from the Olivet community and beyond. Our theme this year is Grief and recovery.

Grief takes many forms. It can arrive suddenly or unfold slowly over time. It might be tied to the loss of a person, a place, yourself, or something less easily named. Recovery, too, is not a single path, but a rocky road, a reimagining of life after loss.

For the 2026 issue, we invite work that explores the vast landscape of grief and/or recovery. Pieces may focus solely on the ache of absence, the disorientation of change, the sharp edges of sorrow. Or they may lean into the fragile, powerful, steps toward healing. Some may hold both grief and recovery in tension; others may rest entirely in one. We are not seeking neat conclusions. We are seeking truth; in whatever shape it takes.

We accept art in any form that may be reproduced on a page. We are looking for work that is engaging and striking. Fiction, creative nonfiction, poetry, photography, and other art are all welcome. All submissions are reviewed anonymously, regardless of form, which ensures that no author will be judged by race, creed, sexual orientation, or political ideology.

Technical Details

Prose submissions should be double-spaced and not include your name in the body, header, footer, or file name.
We accept files in the following formats: docx, doc, and rtf. Submissions with strong visual components like comics or graphic narratives should be submitted as .jpg or .png files.
Please name your files with your submission's title (NOT your name) -- file names like "Story 1" make file management difficult. Prose submissions are limited to 3000 words. We do accept excerpts of longer work and may publish the longer piece on our website--please include and label the excerpt and the entire work in your submission.
Multiple and Simultaneous Submissions

Individuals may submit up to five pieces total, in any combination of media. If your pieces are the same genre, you may put them in the same submission. All pieces will be reviewed individually.
Our review time is short: we will make decisions by the beginning of December, so we ask that you wait until you hear back from us before submitting your work elsewhere. However, please let us know immediately if your work is no longer available.
The Garfield Lake Review is the annual literary and visual arts magazine produced by University of Olivet students, and it is a proud member of the University of Olivet Media Board. We produce a print journal and post an online edition on our website. Contributors in the continental U.S. may receive a complimentary copy and purchase additional copies. Other contributors may pay shipping and receive their copy.
