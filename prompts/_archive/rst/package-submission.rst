Solicitation
============

How’d we get started?
Funicular Magazine was founded by Jeremy Bibaud and Jason Lee Norman. The idea simultaneously, independently, and cosmically, came to the minds of its editors over a pint in 2018. We saw a literary fiction-sized hole in Edmonton, Alberta. Sure, at the time our arch-nemesis Glass Buffalo had cornered the market on this genre by winning award after award for their perfect and beautiful magazine, but in the famous words of Shania Twain—that don’t impress me much. Besides, one of our editors is a MacEwan University alum (Go Griffins or whatever!) so we can only go so far in our praise of a magazine published by Edmonton’s other university. We published our first issue in 2019 and we’ve been doing it three times a year since.

where’d We get that name?
Funicular was a placeholder until we thought of something better. In the end, we didn’t. Not because we’re lazy, but because the word is so damn fun to say. It felt appropriate too, as both editors have fond memories or ancestral ties to Lisbon, Portugal, where funiculars are as common as F-150s in Alberta. Coincidentally, Edmonton eventually built its very own funicular which made the name even more fitting.

Why are you always talking about knocking people out?
It’s just a tagline! Julio Cortázar said “the novel wins by points, the short story by knockout.” Our goal is to find fiction and poetry that lives up to this. If you don’t feel like you just had your bell rung after a short story or got punched in the gut after a poem, what’s the point? 

Up to 5 poems

Submissions
===========

Dinner Wine
-----------

| The dinner wine of nervous dates
| once grew upon a Summer vine.
| The Autumn wind now hushed awaits
|       the dinner wine. 
|
| Beneath the Winter's pure moonshine,
| our words distill like concentrates 
| til fingers find yours under mine. 
|
| A taste of Spring now circulates 
| as starry arcs began decline,
| the final drop that dedicates 
|       the dinner wine.

Little Sprout
-------------

| Oh, little sprout, the forest sleeps
| in arid ground now cursed by drought.
| Across the land, the desert sweeps,
|       oh, little sprout. 
| 
| Your boldness lacks a water spout
| but hidden root in darkness steeps
| the moisture buried deep in doubt. 
|
| The dream of Spring nobody keeps 
| ascends in stems so small and stout 
| when mourning sky beholding weeps,
|       oh, little sprout.

The Origin of Lies
------------------

| Oh, Ila, don't be weeping,
|    my dear, you misconstrue;
| The sun is only sleeping
|    before it rises new.
|
| I'll wait with you til morning,
|    and tell you of the stars,
| the memories adorning
|    the empty night with scars. 
|
| This love that's learned by lacking,
|    whose vastness has no chart,
| in silent orbits tracking
|    the shaping of your heart. 
|
| Please trust that nothing passes,
|    we only change our form.
| The morning dew amasses
|    on leaves the sun can't warm.
|
| Child, listen, though you're growing,
|    some things cannot be known
| until you've grown up knowing
|    out here you're all alone.
|
| I'll be with you forever,
|    these words will be a lie.
| If I could but this deliver:
|    To live until you die.
|
| So while you're small, keep holding
|    my hand as though it soothes,
| The world will keep unfolding
|   each wrinkle that it smoothes.
|
| Believe me when I'm saying:
|    Oh, Ila, darling dear,
| No matter what I'm staying,
|    I'll always be right here. 

Ode to Upholstery
-----------------

| the Sunday mornings hang in clouds of smoke
| above my head where thoughts of you reside
| recalling times my clumsy fingers broke
| some stitch or knit your fingers deftly tied,
| or when you'd measure out your thread
|       to fix the errors made
|           and sew it back anew,
| i knew when watching as you spread
|       the fiber that i frayed,
|           i never would be you.
|
| a box of decades stored in bobbin spools
| unwind within my open palm their loops,
| reversing ages into circled pools;
| a single tangled knot erupts and droops,
| undone so quick and dripping thick
|       through winding yards of years
|           you spun around the drum
| before the plunging needle prick,
|       this moment reappears
|           along the lengths i thumb.
|
| what cluttered racks of vinyl rolls to stack
| against the walls where once you puffed your pipe,
| the only imitation i could crack
| now burning in my teeth, a cherry ripe
| as molten metal cast in molds
|       before the water chills
|           and shapes the studs with steam
| to snaps you press through sheets and folds
|       of layered woven twills,
|           to hide the lonely seam.
|
| the intersecting threads of me through strands
| of silken plumes, they needle past my lips
| from dying gears that spin beneath your hands
| to weave the pattern drawn by fingertips
| upon the fabric draping down
|       in wrinkled folds of cloth
|           unrolled in hazy rooms,
| like ones you sketched with focused frown
|       and cut to clear the swath
|           of me that burns and fumes.
|
| these empty rooms of tools you left behind,
| as if some day i'd understand their use,
| instead infected specks of rust i grind
| with oiled stones on spinning spokes that loose 
| eroded flakes of showered flames
|       and spray the ground with red,
|           the dust of wasted time,
| each careful pass of sparks reclaims
|       the last remains you shed, 
|           the gleam that hides in grime.
