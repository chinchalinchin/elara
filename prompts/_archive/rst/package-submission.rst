Our Mission
The mission of The Hopkins Review is to publish today’s vital voices and visions in literature, culture, criticism, public-facing scholarship, and the arts. In 2022, we celebrated our 15th year of continuous publishing with a commitment to creative excellence and its dynamic, diverse, and inclusive present and future. The Hopkins Review is a partnership between two venerable literary entities, the Writing Seminars at Johns Hopkins University (the country’s second-oldest degree-granting creative writing program, est. 1947) and the Johns Hopkins University Press (the country’s oldest continuously running university press, est. 1878). Curated by editor in chief Dora Malech, fiction editor Danielle Evans, and an editorial staff of talented emerging writers honing their own craft in the Writing Seminars, The Hopkins Review endeavors to feature a unique blend of tradition and innovation reflective of both its deep roots and vibrant intergenerational team. We strive to bring the international, national, and local together under one cover, contributing to Johns Hopkins University’s broader mission of “knowledge for the world” by engaging international voices and conversations alongside our nation’s most exciting established and emerging writers and platforming the rich artistic and literary community of our home city of Baltimore on that same global stage. We believe in building a local, national, and international community of readers that connects and coheres around a shared love of literature and culture. Thank you for being a part of The Hopkins Review community.

Our History

When Professor Elliott Coleman established the Writing Seminars (first called the Department of Writing, Speech, and Drama) in 1947, it was only the second program of its kind in the country. Coleman saw publishing as part of his fledgling department’s mission and launched the first issue of The Hopkins Review that same year under his own editorship, making it the first university literary journal published by a degree-granting creative writing department. From 1947 to 1953, the journal featured creative titans like poet e. e. cummings and fiction writer John Barth (a 1951 Writing Seminars alumnus and later faculty member), whose first published short story appeared in the pages of The Hopkins Review. Despite its auspicious beginning, however, the journal ceased production in 1953, its great promise cut short by a simple lack of funding and full-time faculty. 

Dormant but not forgotten for over half a century, The Hopkins Review was revived by John T. Irwin, Decker Professor in The Writing Seminars, who announced in 2007 that he was reinstating a “New Series” of the journal—this time, as a joint venture between two of the university’s literary powerhouses, the Writing Seminars and the Johns Hopkins University Press. Since its founding in 1878 (just two years after the founding of the university itself), the JHU Press had served as a champion of the literary arts and public-facing humanities. Daniel Coit Gilman, the first president of Johns Hopkins University, saw publishing as integral to the university’s mission, averring, “It is one of the noblest duties of a university to advance knowledge and to diffuse it not merely among those who can attend the daily lectures but far and wide.” Sixty years after the founding of both the Writing Seminars department and its original literary journal, The Hopkins Review (New Series) would once again publicly showcase Johns Hopkins University’s long-standing and forward-thinking commitment to the creation and appreciation of great literature through a partnership between the nation’s oldest university press and one of its first creative writing programs. 

Despite their temporal distance, the new and old incarnations of The Hopkins Review share a mission of excellence in contemporary letters. Professor Emeritus John Barth bridged the 20th century Hopkins Review and the 21st, contributing to both the first and second issues of The Hopkins Review (New Series)in 2008, as he had contributed to the original journal decades earlier as an emerging writer. Other contributors to The Hopkins Review (New Series) have included literary and scholarly luminaries such as Donald Barthelme, Harold Bloom, Erica Dawson, Stephen Dixon, Denis Donoghue, Claudia Emerson, Tony Eprile, Marilyn Hacker, Vanessa Hua, Millard Kaufman, Frank Kermode, Richard A. Macksey, Jill McCorkle, Shane McCrae, Alice McDermott, Natalie Shapero, A. E. Stallings, Colm Tóibín, Helen Vendler, Claire Vaye Watkins, C. Dale Young, and many others. Recent and forthcoming issues include Stephanie Burt, Terrance Hayes, Heather McHugh, Paul Muldoon, Carl Phillips, Claudia Rankine, Adrienne Su, Afaa M. Weaver, and Alejandro Varela, among many other vital voices.

Announcing the relaunch of The Hopkins Review in 2007, Irwin said that he believed that a “top-ranking writing program needed . . . a literary quarterly.” True to his vision, The Hopkins Review is a quarterly review publishing fiction, poetry, and memoir; essays on literature, drama, film, the visual arts, music, and dance; interviews, folios of visual art, and translations; as well as reviews of books, performances, and exhibits. Susan McCallum-Smith of WYPR and Urbanite magazine called The Hopkins Review “a postmodern blend of intellectual heft and Vaudeville.” The Hopkins Review is a print publication that is also archived electronically in perpetuity through Project MUSE.  

New Series founding editor Professor John T. Irwin was succeeded by Professor David Yezzi as editor in 2015, and Associate Professor Dora Malech became the editor in chief in 2022. Irwin passed away in 2019, but his vision for The Hopkins Review endures. Of original department and journal founder Elliott Coleman, Professor Emeritus John Barth said, “I have admired Elliott Coleman’s short poems and his long poems; most of all I admire his longest-running poem: the Johns Hopkins Writing Seminars, over which his benignant spirit still very much presides.” In this sense, The Hopkins Review is Irwin’s poem, and Coleman’s too: an ongoing creative work.

The Council of Editors of Learned Journals honored The Hopkins Review’s 15th anniversary redesign with a Phoenix Award for Significant Editorial and Design Achievement, and individual works published in THR have been selected for or received special mention in anthologies that include Best American Poetry, Best American Short Stories, the Pushcart Prize anthology, Best Spiritual Literature, and Best Literary Translation. 

Submit up to five poems (no more than ten pages total). We also welcome poetry in translation; however, it is the translator's responsibility to have secured all necessary permissions, and any associated permissions fees are the responsibility of the translator. We do not consider previously published poetry. Translated poetry can be previously published in its original language or by other translators, but your submitted translation should be previously unpublished. 

Our submission fee is waived for subscribers. If you are interested in taking out a subscription to the Review, click here. If you subscribe, please email thehopkinsreview@gmail.com and request a fee-waived link for subscribers.  

If you have not yet published a debut book of poetry, please note that in your cover letter, so we can consider it for nomination for the Best New Poets anthology, if accepted. If you would be eligible for other specific post-publication awards, we encourage you to note your eligibility in your cover letter.  

For a sense of what we publish, we encourage you to subscribe, buy an issue, check out our open-access web features, or take a look at the year's sample print issue on Project MUSE.
