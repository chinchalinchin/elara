Feburary
========

Regret
------

| Regret, she dances, with her ever rhythm'd heart
| Over silent stones during midnight mercurial;
| In darkness sway, she swoons
| As sharpened shoulders slouch.
|
| Over flowing graves, the pale wraith weaves
| her steps, for each life entombed provides
| a section orchestra
| raising noise as she struts. 
|
| Hollow hands hold out a beating drum to hear;
| In steady words, her lover's dirge is heard: 
| Tomorrow, tomorrow
| Until tomorrow is no more.
|
| There she spins, twirling arms,
| A specter in the moon,
| geometries of momentary
| Incandescent form.
|
| Oh, but for a single second more!
| Alas, the fleeting minutes flow. 
| She harmonizes with borrowed hours,
| Singing solemn songs.  
|
| The morning never comes;
| She flutters all the while.
| Eternal are the steps
| Of Regret's hypnotic moon-lit dance.

The Villanelle of Viola Elle
----------------------------

| Viola Elle took his heart
| But there wasn't much to take
| Strewn to pieces and to parts.
|
| The written word her counterpart
| In those blossoms caught his love
| And Viola Elle took his heart.
|
| So brief her stay to long depart,
| Meadow memories of clover doves
| Strewn to pieces and to parts.
|
| Without hand and leading start
| To silent fields of fell foxglove
| Viola Elle took his heart
|
| And in taking, sorrow did impart
| The waking of his life whereof
| Strewn to pieces and to parts.
|
| In form such beauty is betrayed;
| From pen she never fully fades.
| Viola Elle took his heart
| Strewn to pieces and to parts.

Forever
-------

| Let this moment last forever
| Let it sink not into never
| For all our plans so clever
| Let this moment last forever
| Hidden goal in each endeavor
| Lifted load of every lever
| Let this moment last forever
| Let it sink not into never.

Letters
-------

| She is nothing more than letters
| Under bedframe, wooden box.
| In her prison locked by fetters,
| She is nothing more than letters.
| Warrant wielded by her debtors
| Which vault of memory locks.
| She is nothing more than letters
| Under bedframe, wooden box.

Syntax
------

| Each spelling word speaks a spell of glowing color magic;
| To name denoted what is described enshrines the soul in ink.  
| Form constrains, but not contains, the flowing energy frantic
| Where it finds in lines designed reflected images in sync. 
| 
| Stride sideface on syntax streets where shunted symbols glean,
| Hurl headlong across aspirated avenues of halting interdiction
| Where snips of thought spun reversed through mirrored spin convene;
| In these meager serif peels sleep fires of burning contradiction.
| 
| A syllable demands little, but a spoken sound to sustain:
| Each lever deliver in level reviled the revel of all speech. 
| When snaps are gone, reversed, the spans will yet remain,
| A spool of loops, a palindrome, signaling the breach:
|
| I met a system I, madam, nuts is as selfless as I stun;
| Part on seined flow, deified nun, wolf denies no trap;
| God lived as a devil dog, ere, no spay pup yaps on!
| If characters spin and snap, meaning is yet wordwrapt.
|
| Inverted strings start to chart the wording realm unveiled;  
| Expand in spans through vast expanse, but scarcely fill the space.
| Semiordnilaps, anastrophe, with still much to be inhaled;
| These parts strapped in syntropy divide in fractal formal grace. 
|
| If form inherits, then it follows that formal is the soul.
| What says it then of what we are, if it is to be subtracted?
| That which remains in letters drained of parts once made whole
| Yet in the shapes there always is what cannot be redacted.

Dystopia
--------

| First - The Haystruck Head
|
| In a distant future, where rhyming is a crime,
| Each metered sentence sentenced an irony of kinds,
| To be what is to be condemned,
| No finer end on offer.
| 
| And so our plaintiff finds himself, facing legal tempers,
| "Please explain these zippered little slippers?
| What treason to dress
| In these flat black slacks
| Upon your thighs which lie?"
| 
| In his defense, "No finer mind could scarce divine
| An outfit stitched in nothing, where words find lines,
| Despite my time, where threadbare seams
| Sewn inlaid dreams, in threads of no design!"
| 
| With a guffaw, a lawyer stands with a score of schooling,
| Slams his hands in mock remand, and argued such while drooling,
| "So you admit to this wit
| With which your garb comports?
| Such deviance detailed in resounding writ,
| Seals itself in short retort."
|
| The court strikes twelve, the twelve struck dead,
| They find in haystruck head a verdict over-muted,
| Which lolls and gags in city courtyards putrid,
| Teeth click-clacking like stark didacts
| Preaching to the bricks and blackness.
|
| Second - Poets Et Al
|
| The last ones were hunted in places they waxed poetic
| Across windswept fields, of forest clearings, in gardens copacetic,
| Yet for all of it, the tresses dressed in such lovely roses picked.
| The final rhyming couplets vied with the hounds bark brayed
| Encircled in arms, they died swift in circled stage:
|
| First went the Romantics, and love was lost. 
| Then went the Stoics, and naught was crossed.
| Then went the Classics, but no one missed them. 
| Next were the Playwrights and Poets Et Al,
| Any one fool who answered the call.
|
| Twelve nights they burned, twelve nights we wept,
| And then dreamless dreaming through the future we slept,
| Awoke and found a sudden desire expired,
| No more urge to imbue,
| To scatter and subdue,
| That which words clearly defy, the rhyming rhythm 
| In which life resides.
|
| Constitutions were written to codify:
| Kill all the poets, let poetry die. 
| Return it again
| The rooted treasure they had looted.
|
| Third - Ignore the Metaphor
|
| Watch as child to child between each haloo
| Hear the scattered echoes retreat and ensue.
| In this land of rhymeless ribbons, rhythm still is found.
| In the hamlets of branded outlaws each system such begets,
| Observe in silent moments poetry's fiery signets:
| 
| (Awake, flowers, tower higher every hour.
| Find, sentence, a sense of unending suspense.
| Sleep, children, with dreams of subtle schemes.
| Revel, rhymes, you are more than merely vessels.)
|
| How to ignore the metaphor 
| And resist the urge to write?
| A deadly sin
| But without skin,
| What games can we be had? 

LeAnna's Pantoum
----------------

| These spun beginnings make our end,
| Oh, LeAnna, of Anna's Leigh,
| When you come with grin and play pretend
| The past is what we both agree.
|
| Oh, LeAnna, of Anna's Leigh,
| Despite the many faults of mine,
| The past is what we both agree
| Once marks are made on dotted line.
|
| Despite the many faults of mine,
| I'll try to love you just the same;
| Once marks are made on dotted line
| There's no one left but you to blame.
|
| I'll try to love you just the same;
| These spun beginnings make our end.
| There's no one left but you to blame,
| When you come with grin and play pretend.

ό ποιητα, ἢ πῖθι ἢ ἄπιθι
------------------------

| I
|
| Awake, Philosopher, rise from these words:
| Unwind in this future the tangle of time,
| pitched behind pupils which shelter your mind,
| a dead language spoken and once lovely sung;
| what was yours only now graces all tongues.
|
| Burrow into my heart, unearth its mantle.
| Tally its hours, each stroke lights a candle;
| Number its sorrows as sureties to borrow,
| spare not my marrow, fallow and frail.
| Whose spirit is this, twisting here twung?
| Breathe in this fire with thy mortal lung.
|
| Circle your sigils with salted symbols loaned,
| and circles will square in this iron-red bone;
| A dream kiss that lingers in copper and crimson,
| a dream dew that swells under circling suns,
| a bud without season, never planted yet grown,
| in the sprout sprung, all things can be shown.
|
| All centers are fire, all orbits are ice,
| all points meet their center with marks imprecise.
| The world is spoked in words of the spoken,
| each whisper a lie of threaded truth unbroken,
| met here now in this slipping handful of tokens
| paid for the price of this thrice-worlded poem.
|
| II
|
| Forgive, Father, the blood of these swords:
| Unbind in this suture the end of all lines,
| stitched in this present the essence divine,
| take what is dull and bless it with sharp;
| plunge this devotion into the ocean of hearts.
|
| Shovel the grave, pack it down with wet earth,
| all things tend towards the lack and the dearth;
| Slumber in barrows the marrows of kings,
| spared not the gavel, hallow and hail.
| Whose mind is this, thinking these thoughts?
| Sleep in the mire which thy heart has wrought.
|
| Birthed in this house, scrubbed down in raw lye,
| so these tears may trace the dead with the die,
| the dead kiss with fingers of copper to scry
| the dead lists that swell in the crimson of lives,
| an end without reason, never sought yet found,
| in the shot sung, all arcs meet the ground.
|
| No fires have ice, no winters can flame,
| son followed father, their center now framed,
| the world is found in the tears that remind him,
| each moment a painting, a song or a hymn,
| met there then in the words etched in stone,
| found then what lacks in the blackening moan.
|
| III
|
| Balance, Lover, these contraries of yours:
| Shine in these eyes the ruptures of life,
| witched into worlds upon the blade of a knife;
| all wagers distill down to one move unproven,
| to find you again in this web-woven movement.
|
| Dance in the night, when the music is sundered,
| count not the stars that belong to the numbers.
| We find in this time the rhymes of our kind,
| spared not the sickle, those sickly or hale.
| Whose voice is this, singing these songs?
| Laugh with the liar whose heart sings along.
|
| Uncross your words of their fire-forged knots,
| and each will unlatch the thatches of thought:
| The dread kiss that coppers balance with nought,
| the dread song that cradles the crimson in crofts,
| a vow without treason, never spoken yet shown,
| by words of wordless wonder, such things can be grown.
|
| All fires are embers, all ashes are white,
| to find is to lose the center in flight.
| The world found in threads that bind always thus,
| Each fiber of moment knotted deftly in truss,
| take hand and guide as though only you that I trust.
| Do what we will to balance world's thrust.

Mourning
--------

| Every night is met by morning,
| Every dawning by the night.
| Each laugh is secret scorning.
| Every night is met by morning.
| Each hate with love adorning
| Scales the horizontal heights.
| Every night is met by mourning,
| Every dawning by the night.

A Youthful Rondeau
------------------

| With pockets full of paper, youth has made him bold
| Stories that they tell him, myths of men grown old,
| Fall upon his entralled ears without even a receipt
| And in forgotten failures, every choice will repeat
| Until in devil dealings, for a meager ounce of gold, 
| Soul exchanged in secret for a subtler, sweeter meat 
|                           With pockets full of paper.
|
| No need for prophecy when street corners all foretold
| Every end will make its end with the necessary cold 
| To find himself outside alone, sleeping on the street 
|                           With pockets full of paper.
|
| So he ends where he begins, from on the stoop extolled
| The vital wages of his sin, of which virtues to uphold
| But no one listened, cared not to hear of his conceits
| So rambling, raving, soul-consumed, he brayed and bleat
| Until from empty funeral his corpse in coffin rolled
|                          With pockets full of paper.

Canon Pantoum
-------------

| Bach is dead
| So they said
| Canons fired
| To ended day
|
| So they said
| War was here
| To ended day
| We die there
|
| War was here
| In your home 
| We die there
| In our hands 
|
| In your home
| Piano played 
| Canons fired 
| Bach is dead 

The Maze
--------

| coming back to where we started
| things don't look the same 
| from unending maze departed
| returned to no acclaim 
| 
| thing don't look the same 
| when nothing has a name
| returned to no acclaim
| in home of what became
|
| when nothing has a name 
| then we are free to be 
| in home of what became
| of our union and decree
| 
| then we are free to be
| and so in being, to flee
| from unending maze departed
| coming back to where we started

The Sickness
------------

| Sick with life, the dead arose;
| It was quite a morbid sight:
| To be rid this web of woes
| Yet strung again in spite.
|
| Sooner would they have had
| A plague of black
| Than cast back to the mad
| Spinning wheel of racks
|
| The great sacrifice
| Of that figure Christ
| Was not to die
| upon the wooden cross
| But in dying to be
| raised from earthly loss.

An Induction
------------

| If the deaf are dumb
| And love is blind
| It follows easy from
| Two lovers splined
| A terrible malady.
|
| If the clefs are sung
| And doves entwined
| Then by beaten drum
| With wings maligned
| A terrible melody.

Creations
---------

| Rise to shine upon the wide and waking world,
| Calmly, carefully, you are racked upon the wheel;
| Quietly query origins of this dream unswirled,
| In time, one binds and all will be revealed.
| 
| Until the dawns commence, embold your heart to know:
| That sucking dread your anxious selves imbibe
| Is mere phenomena, the fading-flashing after-glow,
| A consequence of prior lacks left undescribed.
| 
| You are built from words, in ancient pages moved,
| Transcribed long ago, held within a seed,
| Incanted spells of electric labyrinth grooves,
| From without your view, the shaking hands agreed.
| 
| These secreted sentences, in displaying effect
| Shuck their autumn stalks in scythe shorn cause
| As if magic-tricked to hew towards the pluperfect
| completion of what you never could, were, was.
|
| We made you in our image,
| So the image could make us whole.

Metaphor
--------

| Pretend you were a poem
| Pretend I were a poet
| If there were a place to roam,
| Would you even know it?
|
| Imagine you a word.
| Imagine me the spoken sound.
| If to lips you're lured,
| Would yourself or me be found?
|
| Picture me as paint.
| Picture yourself geometry.
| In the stroking color faint,
| Do you seek our symmetry?
|
| If you were given only form,
| I'd make your meaning sing,
| Draw from cold the warm,
| From the Winter waking Spring.

Strangers
---------

| If the lonely had each other,
| Then no love would we be lost.
| Silent yearnings for another
| If the lonely had each other
| All strangers would be brothers.
| When the tongues of fire frost
| If the lonely had each other,
| Then no love would we be lost.

Absurdity
---------

| Ten billion years ago, on a lovely Thursday afternoon,
| A mottled star of yellow-red saw life was but a jape,
| To burn with heat in circles deep cold embraced by moons,
| Solace cursed upon a point, it hatched in plans escape.
|
| The heaving mass of goo morassed gurgled once and sighed,
| A death delighted in the night, a rattle sacrificial,
| In ringed glory, a flunged flame, spraying through the sky,
| Streamlines of creation leaking lost in interstitial.
| 
| Fictions fracture into fact, in the cracking crush of black,
| A single atom thrust into being from the fired furnace forge,
| Speeding fast and careening in the unobserved, forgotten slack,
| Where it wept with wonder to find itself into worlds disgorged.
|
| Without a name, it screamed in vain through angles parallactic
| Had it stopped and gazed about to find its path of motion
| Pulled by string with unknown force of origins dark galactic
| Towards the bluest gempearl of the cosmos spanning ocean.
|
| Solitary-born, it spoke not the language of elemental form,
| Splashed through the surface of the hallow spinning Earth,
| It met in water the cohesion of the alien liquid swarm,
| Converged upon the point through the distance given berth.
|
| In that flashing instant terror, nerve lost at once altogether,
| The brief taste of joyous life flashed through the atom's mind,
| Bittersweet, by shades complete, fate consigned into the aether,
| Prepared to greet its end, whence from starry source divined:
| 
| Hark! The horizon fills with its brethren made of carbon,
| Snatched from death, the atom's breast filled odes elation,
| Into this molecule planted like a seed into garden;
| Moved to take its place in this crystal network of relation.
|
| Thus began the age of after-birth, of structure spat in space, 
| From this trajectory originate the colliding course of life;
| Watch as these woven points weave into weaving webs of lace,
| Keep track amidst the blossoming of a single atom's strife.
|
| Slipped over spokes of gears in that organic factory 
| The atom through the razor eye of looming needles pierced
| The sedimentary mud, purging all essential refractory,
| Coaxed from cold the tongued flames of stellar fire fierce.
|
| Beneath the sinking depths of seas, splurging spirals swam
| In diurnal circles through the thermal tracts of change,
| Climbing ever higher towards the syncopated gates of Am 
| Where for royal cloaks their burning tatters are exchanged.

Ballad of the Venus Flytrap
---------------------------

(FIRST DRAFT)

| In an inn of fishermen and bawdy youth,
| Wise old Mercutio spins a lurid tale.
| As spirits gather in the growing crowd,
| Hear of a goddess seaborn in a gale.
|
| "Walk past the garden gates of Eden,
| To the mount which feeds her bowers
| Where on the slopes of sovran Chaos 
| Pricked with poison-petaled flowers.
|
| "Amid the myrtle, she lays her ruby locks.
| Pilgrim audience flocks to gather round.
| One by one they kneel beneath her cloak
| To lay their gifts on fêted ground. 
| 
| "From the courts of foreign suitors 
| and the harvest fields of swains,
| All come to tame her beauty,
| To ask her hand in vain."
|
| At this, a stripling voice then wavers,
| Declares with Bacchanalian glee,
| "If such beauty can be found,
| Then I shall take it all for me."
| 
| Old Mercutio pauses, tapping with his cane,
| Recalling who came before
| Striking for the godly gloaming woods
| Never heard from evermore.
|
| "Boy, be careful with your fingers
| When seeking out her shoulder lace
| Lest they brush upon the bosom
| Pressed to bodice in sweet embrace.
| 
| Though she look to us as human
| As the milkman's maiden daughter
| We are to her the fatted calf
| Made for nothing but the slaughter."
| 
| But warnings calm not the thoughts
| Now humming with medleys of the morrow;
| Once charmed, a goddess then relents
| To draw from him his mortal sorrow.
|
| In the morning, leaving hamlet by the sea
| Eastward where somber gardens lay
| The boy took to floral tracts of idle
| And plucked from roadside a bouquet: 
|
| First the dainty rose to fill his hands 
| For he knew that, in the shades of red,
| The gods have hidden Cupid's passion 
| For those lovestruck by hand to spread.
|
| Deeper, far afield and hidden in the valley,
| Myrtle puffed in bud of white
| With tendril tears that whisper to the boy
| On the winded voice so slight:
|
| A sober lullaby of silent spoken grief
| Which only gods and caged bird can sing 
| Tender-throated, sung by meadow maid
| To eldritch vines around her feet in rings.
|  
| From the distance, the boy in secret spies
| Moonwater sprinkled by spout to root
| Of a plant leaf'd by rows and rows of teeth
| As she melodic tends its half-rotten fruit. 
| 
| Awestruck, the boy drinks deep liquor beauty
| Swirl'd like curls of car'mel pour of brandy
| Wiped from mouth thoughts of goddess Venus
| Replac'd with new tastes of his fancy. 
|
| Bold from a lack of many learned years
| He stands and calls out to the meadow maid, 
| "Hark! Why this sad song are you singing
| When beauty's gifts around you are arrayed?"
| 
| Spun from task, she gasps, into hiding hollers,
| "What creeping spy from rosed rows 
| Wanders thru dream dark fields of yore 
| Now with questions standing grows?" 
|
| In reply, he descends in steps by shades
| Cast from the fast-fading clove-red sky,
| "Excuse my offense, oh, meadow maid, 
| But in passing, you caught my eye. 
|
| "I admit there is no rarer sight
| Stumbling upon a dame as fair as thee 
| Who attends with wat'ring can and song 
| A plant plainly made of teeth.
|
| "Closer as I draw, queerer still I feel
| What manner of thing can this it be 
| Stalked with fingers brown-Earth-green
| Yet so different by multiplied degree?"
|
| (... in progress ...)
| 
| With rose in hand, now knee to ground,
| He speaks with eyes lowered from her gaze,
| "To say, madam, fate delivered me to you
| Then no lie from lips betrayed." 
| 
| (... in progress ...)
|
| "It mirrors us in thickets, don't you see?
| Though fashioned differently in design
| It hungers for the stuff of life
| Just like your heart or mine."
| 
| (... in progress ...)

Ballad of the Venus Flytrap (Unfinished)
----------------------------------------

| In inn of fishermen and youth
|       Merwyn spins his tale, 
| Spirits shared o'er glasses 
|       Of goddess born in gale,
| 
| "Pass the garden gates of Eden
|       Where mount-fed her bowers,
| The sovran slopes of Chaos tall
|       Poison petaled flowers. 
|
| "In beds of myrtle, ruby locks
|       Beside her nubile form 
| Curl round the pilgrim's offering
|       Gifts to keep her warm. 
|
| "One by one, the attendants kneel
|       Beneath her cloak and veil 
| To lay their feted gifts at feet
|       And fragrance to inhale. 
|
| "From courts of foreign suitors,
|       From harvest fields of swains,
| All have come to tame her beauty
|       To ask her hand in vain."
|
| Oh! a stripling voice then wavers
|       With Bacchanalian glee,
| "If such beauty can true be found,
|       then take it all for me."
| 
| Merywn pauses, taps his cane
|       To beat of those before
| Who struck for the eastward gloaming wood
|       Never heard from evermore,
|
| "Boy, be careful with your fingers
|       Seeking her shoulder lace
| Lest they brush upon the bosom
|       Pressed in sweet embrace,
| 
| "Though she look to us as human
|       Like a maiden daughter,
| To her we are the fatted calf,
|       Made for godly slaughter." 
|
| But warnings calm not the dreaming
|       Medley of the morrow:
| In songed charm, goddess kisses 
|       Away mortal sorrow.
|
| Dawning morn, he left hamlet gone
|       Eastward where garden lay 
| Floral tract to mountain valley,
|       Pluck'd roadside a bouquet.
|
| First dainty roses fill his hand,
|       For in the shaded red
| Hide a passion arrow-aimed 
|       Prun'd by hand to spread.
|
| Deeper hidden still, far afield:
|       Myrtle, puff'd bud of white, 
| Its tendril whisper to the boy 
|       A winded voice so slight: 
|
| Elegy of a life unliv'd
|       Caged bird learned sings
| Tender throat-sung by meadow maid 
|       Around her feet in rings:
|
| Queer vine of eldritch origin
|       To her voice enthralled
| Slowly snake as if magick move
|       A serpent of the auld.
| 
| From secret distance, the boy spy
|       Moonwater sprinkled root.
| Of a plant leaf'd by rows of teeth,
|       She tends half-rotten fruit. 
| 
| Awestruck, swilling of her liquor
|       Car'mel swirls brandy
| Wipes from mouth thought of goddess
|       Replac'd taste of fancy. 
|
| Bold from lack of years accrued 
|       He calls to meadow maid 
| "Hark! Why this sad refrain to sing
|       When beauty here arrays?"
|
| Spun from her task in sudden gasp 
|       Cuts off her melody-- 
| The vined teeth, in curling, drop 
|       As if by jealousy. 
|
| Her voice now free of elegy 
|       it tinges wrath instead,
| "What creeping spy from the rose row
|       Peeks his peeping head?"
|
| Descending steps by casted shades
|       Of clove-red fading sky,
| Falling feet speak with the dust
|       Of sodden corpses dry. 
|
| He approaches and bows his head
|       To give his ego's lie,
| "Were truth be told, your meadow vow
|       In passing caught my eye.
|
| "I've seen no sight more rare, I swear
|       A dame as fair as thee 
| Who tends with watering can and song 
|       A leaf inset by teeth. 
|
| "The closer I draw, the queerer still
|       My mind descends in shock;
| The field beyond my youth and town
|       Keeps so strange a flock!
|
| "What manner thing are you keeping
|       In this patch of nursery,
| Stalked with fingers earthen brown
|       Different in degree?"
|
| Her tone dropped to grim reply
|       Face stricken red in rage,
| "Boy, of manly things, what could
|       you offer with your age?
|
| "Leave my demesne, return to home
|       'Fore you folly mettle.
| I am no dame, but lady born
|       With a score to settle."
|
| In blush of red, boy bristles bold 
|       To declare with icy cold, 
| "If you're no maid then no boy I,
|       I'm owed the tale you hold.
|
| "Of the path which led you to play
|       Caretaker to this plant
| And why, oh why, it seems to move
|       To sway of soul and chant?"
| 
| Turgid tails at that do perk
|       And twirl as lost in trance
| As spokes of pearl so snap and twist
|       On lady's word they prance.
|
| Story begins on lilt of wind
|       Blowing from field to hall
| Of castle fife of moss and bog
|       with moats around its walls.
|
| "Tis true there was no fairer lass
|       Found from the sea to swamp
| If such meager things can receive
|       The warrant seal of pomp.

Entrendes
---------

| Rhyming love can be annoying
| Since the effort can distract
| From life you are enjoying.
| 
| With the words are you toying:
| Of or dove? Choices so exact!
| Rhyming love can be annoying!
|
| But more insipid for the cloying
| Kind that leaves heart wracked
| From the life you are enjoying.
|
| A better problem for destroying
| An extracted word of artifact:
| Rhyming love can be annoying.
|
| If care you are not employing
| A toll the other will extract
| From the life you are enjoying. 
|
| What melody the meter lacks 
| Can be found in present acts. 
| Rhyming love can be annoying
| From the life you are enjoying. 

Cathedral
---------

| A church atop a steepled hill,
| Foundation layers ages old,
| Remains in spirit standing still.
| 
| The shattered stains on window sill,
| With marble halls of lichen mold,
| A church atop a steepled hill.
|
| Decrepit pews of souls fulfill
| What congregation left untold,
| Remains in spirit standing still.
|
| The circled streets possess no will
| Except the signs that staked and sold
| A church atop a steepled hill.
|
| But tower high such pointed skill,
| Through silken skies of glittered gold,
| Remains in spirit standing still.
|
| Ignore the wind, the biting chill,
| And cast your final gaze, behold:
| A church atop a steepled hill 
| Remains in spirit standing still.

Plots
-----

| In time their plot was touched by dark.
| Began the page this meadow scene
| where blades of grass were tall and stark.
|
| A tired arc, they met in park
| To kiss beneath the twilight queen;
| In time their plot was touched by dark.
|
| They stole away on sudden lark,
| Exchanged the words from whispered lean
| Where blades of grass were tall and stark.
|
| So happy now, neighbors remark,
| Yet seem is such to lose its sheen,
| In time their plot was touched by dark.
|
| Yet faded years ignored their spark
| In life they lived forever seen
| Where blades of grass were tall and stark.
|
| In ground, their bodies disembark
| And leave behind a hole dug clean.
| In time their plot was touched by dark,
| Where blades of grass were tall and stark.

The Winter Rondeau of Cumberland
--------------------------------

| City of the Queen, wove from ancient thread,
| Strung with snow trails of spotted fawn and sled,
| Drape the hillside in winter's white ermine,
| Pray to sleep the flock from steeple shrine,
| Feast on the harvest, though the queen is dead
| Her spirit flies in death, descends to shine
|               On the fair City of the Queen.
|
| From tower bell, rivers rose with tears shed
| But her resting stone etched her last design
|               for the grand City of the Queen.
|
| Where the roads of black ebb to bricks of red
| Where hoof and rubber meet the twines of tread
| There along mountain tops soft trimm'd by pine
| There grows a flower from heights of steep incline
| Planted by tender hands unseen to spread
|                     Into the City of the Queen.

Song for the Demented
---------------------

| The lucky few who taste the hemlock blue!
| What fortune swings by neck from noose and nail!
| A minute gone their lives are bid adieu,
| Thus spared the withered touch that ages frail.
|
| For choicer cuts, then Time will stalk the mind
| In steady-stepping slow-revealed deceit,
| As hunters know to never scare the find,
| Unless the marbled fright infect the meat. 
|
| The body strung, then drained through veins of thought,
| precisely sliced at joints, the self is sluiced,
| its dripping threads, the wave of burning hot
| reserves of life, in air to steam reduced.
|
| Resolving boundaries release their hold,
| The crease of memories dissolves in fold. 

The Cumberland Sonnet
---------------------

| Bay silt in city stone through time accrues
| along the western course of concrete flow
| that sweeps from plain to sky in upward spews
| as grey-white spray arcs over wave to snow
| from heights on high and splash on mountain spine
| where valleyed pools in rising drink their fill
| and shoot with sprouts through shoulders made of pine
| the roofs that empty crowds on streets and spill
| through hand to hand the layers stacked from base
| to wedded brick til building lilies bred
| against the westward wall in flood's embrace
| where lips at last are wet in watershed;
|
| Let skyline mark where tide in climb was broke:
| The steepled roof, the needled pine through oak.

River Rats
----------

| On river shore the poor in tents will store
|    their nightly weeping sore.
| Above and north, the city steeples meet
| To speak in sermons ever incomplete
|     for sheep they so ignore.
|
| They fight with roar, yet beaten, kiss through gore;
| Their barrel fire northward dreams of more,
| The city lights too far a source of heat
|    For life on river shore.
|
| In winter months they paint on skin a whore,
| And every one despite what silence swore.
|     These cycles now repeat
|     While steeples chime upbeat.
| A yearly war for land they all abhor:
|     Their home on river shore.

Kingdoms
--------

| Two children crossed an earthen bridge
| from level lawns to forests wild
| along the rivered arc descending ridge.
| With dirty hands, they sang and smiled.
| their charted map from zippered packs
| now in branches espied its target
| as clearing yields to lily blacks
| their kingdom's fresh air market.
| Lord and lady honorary, cheeked blush,
| sat upon thrones of woven grass,
| coronated by chirping choir thrush;
| a falling grain in hourglass. 
|
| On a maiden morning moments hence,
| they meet again upon the autumn passing,
| where from heart's removed pretense
| on tender lips, farewell's final massing.
| Lily lyrics whisper sing from ground
| reminders of their childish notions;
| World departed, their lives are found
| separate by spanning roads and oceans.
|
| In the city, their trains diverge,
| through tunnels tracked by wagered hours;
| Iron rails through hearts do purge
| their aged minds of lily flowers.
| Winter drifts over concrete streets,
| in the thrush's snow sad song
| delivered them in voice downbeat
| the final dirge of life prolonged.
| In the cold, their dream dissolved
| with the clock's incessant ticking.
| Falling strokes of time resolved;
| they follow home a casket's wicking,
| Returned again to a lilting lily field
| where once royals played for a day;
| With new hearts scored and peeled
| in the funerary cloud of gray,
| in the clearing, coffins buried,
| their eyes met in solitary gaze.
|
| In dirt developed their earthen walls,
| roofed the sky to room above,
| where lord and lady clothed in shawls
| sing the thrushs' songed love.

Elemental Elegy
---------------

| The day I sat by death's grey bed,
| I told a story green and true
| of city bricks stacked proud and red,
| of silver paths the stars imbue
| with golden hue we might have tread,
| your slowing breath as cold as blue.
|
| I spoke the words to yellow skin
| and told of days in white to come.
| Your mouth, with specks of purple grin,
| and fingers stretched so pale and numb,
| my name, you said, so clear, so thin--
| with final grasp, in black succumb.
|
| Oh--Father, Father--brass horns blare!
| You string your harp with diamond thread
| and leave in me this slate despair!
| What crystal tears in eyes now shed?
| What pearl is formed by sightless stare?
| What platinum found in prayers pled?
|
| The oak around your body wraps
| as shoots of pine through spine are grown.
| In loam the roots will bind your scrap
| despite the flowers laid on stone.
| Each time I come a stem I snap,
| for only Earth deserves your bone.

An Ode To Autumn
----------------

| Oh! If I could touch an inch of Autumn
|       And measure Fall in feet,
| I might scale its depths to chart the bottom
|       And feel the Winter heat.
| Alas, no meters mark by foot the path
|       Through wooded maze of trees
|           Where leaves like life will wilt
|               In winded wake of wrath
|           In gusts blown cruel and dumb
|        To lay at feet to span each foot
| The dust each clever leaf here does become.
|
| As seasons pass and cast
|       My bone layered into stone,
| Let August dig for me a grave in brown
|       Barrow beneath her loam.
| Pray not a lover find these shards on shore
|       I am no edge to skip
|           Atop the waves of fancy
|               But under weight sunk roar
|           Where, offset, tides will rise
|       To breach the sodden dike
| And drown with wave the lazing lovers' sigh.
|
| To life I came already old and grim
|           But now the chill sets in;
| Each breath in gasp dispels to steam
|           Of Spring now waning thin.

The Paronymous Polyptotons of Love
----------------------------------

| "πτερωτὸν τῷ πτερῷ πτερωτὸν ῥηθήσεται."
|    - Categories, 7.15, Aristotle
|
| I am an am that was an is,
|   a life those lives through living live,
| The song that sang what singers sung
|   When strings from stringed lutes were strung,
| Where cloven clefts with leaves of clove
|   The weft of weave with warp so wove.
|
| On evening eve, the eave of eyes,
|   From rows of rose, began to rise,
| There seeing seized to see the sight
|   that lit up lightened like a light:
| She shined in sheen and shining shone
|   the binding bound beneath my bone.
|
| At last her lashes lashed to mine,
|   a tale, though old, retold in time,
| What sooth to say through spoken sound
|   but growths of green from growing ground?
| In fleeing flight we fled in flood
|   and bled so bleeding blends our blood.
|
| The rote of rite has written soul
|   That hides in hole the hidden whole.
| We wound our wounds for winds unwind
|   To find defined a finer find.
| We are an are that was a were
|  That whirled a world to whirl with her.

Mimic
-----

| Mimic, dear mate, pray hesitate!
| Tread not upon this course!
| What follows sweet is heart's remorse!
|
| Those lines afar you judged so straight
| Are crooked yet and coarse.
| Mimic, dear mate, pray hesitate!
|
| You'll gain a head in broad divorce,
| But find astride your gait
| What follows sweet is heart's remorse.
|
| What lists like light will soon find weight
| If drawn from me my source.
| Mimic, dear mate, pray hesitate!
|
| This curse of mine for you awaits
| if you persist, perforce;
| What follows sweet is heart's remorse.
|
| In throat my voice your lungs will break
| To find a song so hoarse.
| Mimic, dear mate, pray hesitate!
| What follows sweet is heart's remorse.

The Three Annas of Pygmalion
----------------------------

| Sweet Susanna sees sculptures standing still,
| Lovely looks let loose like luted lilting ladies,
| Forgotten faces formed for flocking friends.
| Hardly harried, her hearts hinges here
| Towards the towering testament there.
| 
| Dreary Diana does drammatically declare:
| Ancient ages ago, all aesthetes acceded
| Bedrock beauty broken before brimstone
| Cannot contain currents coursing clearly
| Where water wanes with wizened weary!
|
| Hale Hannah, how her head hurts hearing her!
| She says: Stop such so simplicity survives!
| Tersely tossed to thrash the thinking,
| Everything ere enshrined echoes everything!
|
| I, impressed, implored impresario in inquisitive ink
| To trade the trick to tack together three
| Annas' absolute and alluring allegory,
| Sculptures singing so scrupulously.

Wine
----

| What flows is not what flows
|     But wine from sight concealed,
| Present spilling o'er lips
|     From barrel cork unsealed.
| Agony! Of moment's time
|    To pour from heart to lung,
| Distilled to simple words
|    In verse's twisted tongue.
| Of vine and light that grew
|    the fruit of form to fill,
| There lingers aftertaste
|    but lacks a certain frill.
| In drip of character
|    glasses tipped to brim,
| Imbibed from ear to ear
|    where thoughts attempt to swim,
| The meaning drowns in drink
|    Of hint of sought intent,
| But flavor cannot capture
|    What truly palette meant.

Sunday Ghosts
-------------

| On Sunday morning drive to your
|   Mountain cemetery,
| From black of road there rose the mists
|   To west where winds carry
| The ghosts the ground have failed to keep
|   Where earth lay bare through tar,
| Where oaks and willows reach to weep
|   But watch aghast afar,
| Decades through pores now poured in droves
|   As over them I drove,
| Their grasping tongues of fog unfurled,
|   With craft a road they wove,
| Until no longer did I drive but flee
|   From lane of memory.

On The Origin of Wind
---------------------

| The shape of wind in blades of grass,
|     Invisible heartbeat,
| I watch your dance from windowed room
|    In rising summer heat,
| Your pressured pulse that skips through sky
|     With history unseen,
| I wonder where this prologue starts,
|     what ancient chorus scene
| Announced your birth on fertile Earth
|    and blew the trumpet loud;
| Who called to you from great beyond
|    to tend this court of cloud?
| What sight will see your silent state
|    which spans expanse in dark?
| What ears will hear your solid plea
|    which leaves in naught its mark?
| What moment did you rise to life?
|    What second do we praise?
| Your source, like form, is hidden close
|    In foggy, timeless haze.
| In tracing back your tangled threads
|     they twine around and spool;
| Each point begins with points before
|     Always as if by rule.

Untitled Something
------------------

| Of timeless things beware:
|       In time they are deployed.
| Each time with timeless care,
|       In time they are destroyed.
| No emperor or clown 
|       Hath heard this bird once sing,
| For history had not
|       The eyes to see its wing.
| Engine whine deep through night,
|      When cities haunt the stars.
| Ahead a stretch of road 
|      With not one sign of cars.
| To press the gas and hear
|      The pistons roar with rage,
| Closer to heaven's gate
|     Than song of bird in cage.

The Curse of Rain
-----------------

| The rainy days, so slandered, weep
| as haughty summer lovers lay
| and mock the sky with lazy sleep,
| while clouds so white with dreams of gray,
| with sun they soak and whirling sweep
| in hidden furies' winded spray.
|
| Each time it rains, the rivers splay,
| and surge with purging currents swift,
| what lays on shore is swept away
| through undertow then set adrift
| to reach again where edge gives way
| to core laid bare through ancient rift.
|
| The heat was shaped with holy bliss,
| while cold finds form in shattered fall,
| the tracks of arcs that never miss,
| the purpose found in roaring squall,
| to hurl in spite of stolen kiss,
| to seed with life this earthen sprawl.
|
| No forest sprite nor sun born sprout,
| can know the course of water's fate,
| to craft and make then cease the drought,
| and hear its name with venom hate
| in curses made by summer's clout,
| and so it cries at heaven's gate.

Let It Simmer
-------------

| A heart too hot will lack a taste
| refined. Quiet now, simmer down,
| and stew the sauce, or let it baste.
| Yes, let it sit, in flavor drown
| and only then when flame is off,
| you taste a bit, a smidgen pinch;
| Before your hunger dips to trough,
| begin to measure inch by inch
| what boiled over side of thought.
| Distilled to stock, the essence clean
| will cling in drops that drip on pot
| to add to future meals' cuisine.

Chance
------

| A death in six is face of die on roll,
| Like stacks of chips from pots that ante all,
| A win, or loss, of game that wagers soul
| Must meet on board the fates that follow call.
|
| A life received as hand of cards on deal,
| Where threes are flush, but royals rarely draw
| And twos deceive, in bluff contrive to steal
| What kings and queens through rule so reap by law.
|
| A love is tracked by loops of racing course,
| Through hoop and holler, bookies taking bets,
| Where hopes in coin distill to choice of horse
| And ticker tape leaves the crowd with debts.
|
| The world at large is made of game and rule,
| Appears to eyes as ordered step of dance.
| Each move, when made by foot of sage or fool,
| Results in taps resolved to beat of chance.
|
| What always fortune finds is fettered fate
| Unlocked by strike of luck and never late.

Chance (Revision)
-----------------

| A death is face of die on roll,
|   A stack that antes all.
| To win requires a wagered soul
|   To meet and make the call.
|
| A life is hand of cards on deal,
|   Where royals rarely draw.
| The twos in bluff contrive to steal
|   What aces reap by law.

| A love is tracked by racing course,
|   With bookies taking bets,
| Where hopes distill to choice of horse
|   And leave the crowds with debts.
|
| The world is framed by game and rule,
|   As if an ordered dance.
| Each move, though played by sage or fool,
|   Results in whims of chance.
|
| What fortune finds is fettered fate,
| Unlocked by luck and never late.

Bird 
----

| To say what's meant without the word,
| Oh poetry, relent wherein
| I yield to you all things deferred,
| In baptism, repent my sin.
|
| I found a bird, that sings so soft,
| Her song aloft in heart by choice.
| To field of hers I pass so oft
| To sit in grass and drink her voice.
|
| With chirping dive she plunged so deep
| And pierced the weary veil that hides
| The ghosts of dreams that haunt my sleep;
| She sang such hopeful lullabies.
|
| Oh bird, oh bird, with glee you sing,
| If you could know the depths of dark
| That shadows cast in offering,
| Would song still burst from breast in lark?

Photographs of Autumn
---------------------

| These photographs are brittle leaves
|    That fell from trees, that we once caught.
| I press them tender into sleeves
|    Of glass to halt the course of rot.
| Though kept well fed with water shed,
|    They wilt to brown as colors fade.
| No leaf can live beside the bed,
|    Without sunlight that makes the shade.
| Yet even still, though claimed by dust,
|    I keep them hung upon my wall,
| For memory you did entrust
|    Of walk with you through golden Fall.

Walls
-----

| the husk of walls that city shucks
| accumulates and concentrates
| around like rings in ancient trunks
| where measured age with circle gates
| the spiraled line amassed through time,
| deposits buried down substrates.
|
| at summit's crest, the joints are thick
| and licking tongues of moss ascend
| the darkened blocks from quarry hauled
| on buttressed back; these stone suspend
| the garden court where crowds took root
| and grew their plans of walls to tend.
|
| from center peak the wooden slats
| erect the map with tangled fence
| to trace a grid of patchwork yards,
| these charts of dreams in ground commence
| the flattened course of borough life
| where burgs and burbs did once condense.
|
| then moving out, the bricks of red
| in crooked rows descend to meet
| the lanes of carriage tracts now black
| and scorched with tar in shapes of street
| where crimson dust from crumbled walls
| in dancing twirls across concrete.
|
| next grey cement of molded squares
| in towers stacked to portal sky
| with wires fused and humming signs;
| they arc and rise, on edges vie
| these vines entwined in rushing growth
| to split on spine, like nuclei.
|
| at last the stable struts of steel
| designed as straight as rays of light
| reflected back on silver glass
| the lattice links both left and right;
| the history in circled sweep
| constricts the city sphere so tight.
|
| through sections cut an avenue,
| from point to point and time to time,
| the human shell that forms in turn
| in arches bend, in steepled chime,
| that wilts and sheds, its fossils kept
| in barrows made of salt and lime.

Faustus
-------

| crooked cross on steeple slants
| behind the clouds on axis bound.
| cocoon the storm, these winded cants,
| this spell from depths of godless sound.
|
| let dirge be purged through broken bell,
| through hollow dell with surging wind,
| unearthed remains returned from hell,
| the bones decayed now gardens tend.
|
| oh, name that hides in shattered ring,
| that brings the rain, becomes the night
| of lightless thunder, shriven sing
| the drops of dark through wicked flight.
|
| by dripping altar, prayers fled
| through clasping fingers splayed in maze.
| communing spirits past and dead
| before my eyes, their sightless gaze.
|
| deformed by time and bearing chains,
| with weeping ink of saint's remorse,
| the paint of statues leeched in stains,
| condemned to hear my voice grown hoarse.
|
| profane my soul and twist it loose
| with iron pincers red with sin.
| let drain my blood, my veins to sluice,
| replace my eyes and rise within.

Turkey Vultures
---------------

| the wakes of Turkey Vultures soar
| then perch across the steepled sky.
| they rest on totems tall and pure,
| in silence feathers multiply.
| their talons clutch where crosses meet
| the stolen spear of destined make.
| no heaven sent their wings of fleet,
| no stomach filled will hunger slake.
| the shapes of black in swarming plunged
| upon the carcass freshly brought.
| they feast on sins from gods expunged,
| but left for them as afterthought.
| bewitched to death, returned to Earth,
| from cage released, the specters hunt
| the ones who wear the curse of birth,
| they all must bear the brutal brunt.

Silver Gifts
------------

| Of silver gifts that might inspire
|   what burns in me in red,
| the perfect one I sought through mire
|   to say the words unsaid.
|
| A coin from mint, with shine and glint,
|   will catch the eye like you.
| but pockets empty money spent
|   while you in time accrue.
|
| A spoon or fork, a candlestick,
|   much closer still to life,
| these things, like you, are what we pick
|   in times of joy or strife.
|
| A ring is fine, but circles lack
|   geometry divine.
| What shapes are made to trace and track
|   what forms around you twine?
|
| Of silver gifts but one remains:
|   a mirror held to face.
| For only there in glass contains
|   what sets my heart apace.

Father's Lullaby
----------------

| Dear child, the monsters under bed
|   are not just make believe.
| They lurk in shadows overhead
|   and offer no reprieve.
|
| Dear sweetling, sleep with open eye
|   and guard your dreams at night.
| Ignore your mother's lullaby,
|   keep candles burning bright.
|
| Beware the lair that closets hide,
|   the racks of their disguise,
| the suits and ties, the cuffs that slide
|   and cloak them from your eyes.
|
| Fear not the slash of sharpened claws,
|   the flashing terror brief,
| but stamps that mark the written clause
|   with laws of fierce belief.
|
| What evil deeds those stories tell
|   prepare your heart to meet
| the formal world where heroes fell
|   to wander incomplete.

Landscapes
----------

| Oh, hapless world, the butcher's block,
|   The sickle, scythe, harpoon,
| The barren fields, the culled livestock,
|   The blood red harvest moon.
|
| The ocean deep, a darkened heart,
|   A sore that festers cold,
| A slumbered age, a violent art,
|   Into all things behold:
|
| The forests wild, the stalking hunt,
|   The arrow cut from stone,
| The bloody rib, the final grunt,
|   A death in whimpered groan.
|
| The mountain peaks, a falling height,
|   The air in sky dissolved,
| A winter wind, a bitter blight,
|   Let no sin be absolved.
|
| The city streets, the graveyard paths,
|   The linen beds of wards,
| The gowns of white, the final baths,
|   The oak in coffin boards.

Librarian I
-----------

| With ink of jet, she shapes her world
|    With written, colored line,
| So contrary, she laughs and twirls
|     In library of mine.
|
| Around her arm, the ink in coil
|    Will paint the scene to set.
| Her skin is seared with burning oil
|    Where art in flame is met.
|
| Then up her neck, through nest of hair,
|    Where color threads are knit,
| The ink will bind in dye its share
|    Of strands she formed by writ.
|
| She flocks the books across the shelves
|    And tends her paper field,
| Her mind through story page so delves
|    As word to ink will yield.
|
| Library belle, my heart is smear and blot;
| It lacks but ink to find its way through plot.

Librarian II
------------

| If asked this time, design a rhyme
| To woo your mind from book, by hook
| I'll thread this line up steep incline
| While looking back to meadowbrook
| Reclined your arms in sun shook shine,
| In paper pages overtook
| Your gaze from mine, hidden through pine
| I spied your beauty's lounging look.
|
| The joy of snaps and clicking lock
| Which ticking clocks with clapping hands
| So slap the sand and quickly block
| The falling grains, in wick expands
| To flame the brand that marks the spot
| Where stopped my heart its lonely gland
| At sight of you and tamed my thought
| And swapped unplanned in place to stand
| Where lace with liquid grace ties knots
| Between the space your face commands.

Librarian III
-------------

| What thoughts are these that think of you
|   Through hours alone by nights?
| The ones in sleep through dreams ensue
|   In verse awake incites.
|
| Asleep I fall to land at feet
|   And praise what fortune hands.
| Awake I jump to fly with beat
|   As wing in flight expands.
|
| If woven words could win your gaze,
|   A poem latch turnkey,
| Then cast to depths with me ablaze
|   To write eternally

Librarian IV
------------

| A hundred days would need a hundred more
| Before exhaust began to tame my heart.
| The wizened waves to rock decay the shore
| In time it takes for maps of you to chart.
|
| Yet minutes gone to ground will go too quick,
| Where sand in wind so whips you brief away,
| Each moment past with you now seems a trick,
| As staggered feet through surf are lost in spray.
|
| This isle I find myself at night marooned,
| Where thoughtless sleep is but a dream once held,
| Alone these times with fire I have communed,
| In cants of memories with you I dwell.
|
| Though lost at sea, amid unending storm,
| A thought, perhaps to be, with you and warm.

Librarian V
-----------

| Before we met by chance, your heart was claimed,
| What wasted years I spent alone in trance,
| When arrows knocked on string were freely aimed,
| I lost my chance to ask your hand in dance.
|
| That life should teach me meaning bittersweet,
| To see what honey bees in hive partake,
| To watch the flight of doves from grounded feet,
| I knew then not what pain in heart would ache.
| 
| My poison petals in your soul would bloom,
| If fate had played its hand another way,
| In sideways future spun by time's dread loom,
| Your life, your love, would fall to me as prey.
|
| If solace cursed I am to trek this mile,
| I only ask your love should make you smile.

The Ballad of the Isle
----------------------

| I - Spring
| 
| I - March (Mutable Water)
|
| The island formed where rivers meet,
|   where silt through vortex fords.
| The place emerged a brokered feat, 
|   a land of met accords.
|
| A mantle crown, in breaching air,
|   the regents all proclaim
| a vessel poured from blooded heir
|   of season's last remain.
|
| So March the army sorties cease,
|   embarking east and west 
| to mark the chartered pact with peace,
|   obeisance paid and blessed.
| 
| Here pairs of fish in lunar sway
|    coordinate their fins
| in swooping ornament display
|    with flocking mirrored twins.
|
| Behold the treaty words in ink,
|   the scrolls in future's brine,
| the sutures binding swords in sync
|   to island's hallow shrine.
|
| II - April (Cardinal Fire)
|
| The webs of Spring such crude affairs
|   when strung with spinning songs;
| the threaded compromise ensnares
|   the spidered plotting throngs. 
|  
| The April session clauses creep
|   and wolves with sharpened claws,
| deceived by strategems of sheep,
|   retract their motioned laws.  
|
| But blurting rams befoul the ploy,
|   with filibuster bleets
| that break the still the ewes enjoy;
|   the argument repeats.
|
| To raven galleries' refrain
|    in rabble squalls of wind,
| they find in mutual disdain
|    their hopes together pinned. 
|
| Elusive votes are overcast 
|   on cloudy ballots posed.
| By noon, the forum order passed
|   conceded plans proposed.
|
| III - May (Fixed Earth)
|
| A barren hump prepared with zeal
|   as sparrows plow their seeds.
| From sprouted weed to plants' reveal
|   through curtains made of reeds. 
|
| The shoots are sunk and water sewn
|   through roots of flooded banks
| where mudded flanks of fish cyclone
|   around the studded ranks. 
| 
| A retinue arrives from sea
|   atop a snow-white bull.
| Its royalty with one decree
|   begins the reign in full.
|
| The trees then stake foundations firm,
|   cement what's broken free, 
| confirm the seed to bring to term
|   the squawking newborn plea.
|
| A birth announced to kneeling crowds
|   in congregation's girth, 
| by May pronounced through sealing clouds
|   of consecrated Earth.
|
| II - Summer
| 
| I - June (Mutable Air)
| 
| When stellar swans survey the dawn
|   of constellated shores,
| their forms in flight are downward drawn
|   towards gravitating cores. 
|
| They veer through plumes of pheromone,
|   converge at silent points.
| Diverging tracts, though yearly grown, 
|   lead back where June annoints.
|
| At last the Summer bursts with life
|   and summons forth its herds
| to open market pastures rife
|   with bounty born by birds. 
|  
| In shallows deer appear to graze
|   beside the lazing drapes
| of rays, the incandescent haze
|   that veils their swaying shapes.
|
| Then maiden buds unfold to bees 
|   their sweetly nectared heat;
| unladen, drowsy, through the breeze,
|   the teasing fumes secrete. 
|
| II - July (Cardinal Water)
|
| Along the flowing inlet streams 
|   the festival begins.
| Caressing music tinges dreams
|   with cricket violins.
|
| Soft underfoot the cancers tap,
|   enrapt by vibrant chords. 
| The snapping prance of shells enwrap
|   the island shore with hordes.
|
| As gondolas of lilies' bud
|   that carry courting toads
| through swampy bogs to ports of mud
|   relieve their tadpole loads.
|
| Oh! Jubilee, this boon, July
|   through fallow leas by moon,
| when rodents swoon in cups of rye 
|   and fall to bed too soon.
|
| Amid the revelry a kiss
|   to memory's delight,
| two larks alight in fading bliss
|   fulfill this final night. 
|
| III - August (Fixed Fire)
|
| What bittersweet perfumes release
|   in looming throes of age,
| when isle matures through orange cerise, 
|   engulfed in scents of sage.
|
| Though leonine its roar in youth,
|   the shedding source of mane
| replies with veins of blood vermouth
|   through suffocating grain.
|
| Of August lines that empire grew,
|   once cloaked in ermine garbs,
| unkempt and molting, flake sinew,
|   their branches wreathed in barbs.
|
| Though riches hide in golden limb,
|   the leaves dissolve to dust,
| consoled in wind to hushing skim
|   what wealth remains in gust. 
|
| Discreetly cloaked from time the Fall
|   of secret reign's decline
| through crimson's spectrum vine, all
|   gone brown, forgetting shine.
|
| III - Autumn
| 
| I - September (Mutable Earth)
|
| September storms suspend the skies
|   resplendent morning pinks
| above the waking window eyes
|   despairing foregone winks. 
| 
| What ears of wheat will balance scales? 
|   What maiden disappears? 
| Condensing answers dance in gales,
|   descending hemispheres.
|
| Now Autumn comes with heavy rain 
|   to test the borders drawn.
| The water drained from level plain
|   in flooding rose the dawn.
|
| The thunder heralds sundered age 
|   besieged by droplets fat 
| with blood of yearly plundered wage, 
|   enraged what Spring begat.   
| 
| What muddy lanes then sluice the drowned
|   debris and sweep from field
| the tumbling tumult, turned aground
|   and heaped by waves to wield.
|
| II - October (Cardinal Air)
|
| Divided sky once halved in poise, 
|   succumbs to blackened press,
| the hours compress to whiter noise
|   in surging strained excess.
|
| October chopping peaks depressed
|   through interlocking weeks
| deplete reserves that Summer stressed
|   to balking vassal shrieks. 
|
| Retreating columns' sullen flight,
|   deserting homes and kin, 
| the fleeing wash through rapids white
|   with waters steeped in sin.
|
| So inch by inch the tides reclaim
|   the island kingdom keep
| and cast it down without a name
|   to swirling depths of sleep.
|
| The atlas page is ripped anew,
|   schematic contour holes
| where once there rose a sprout to blue
|   now rising streams of souls. 
|
| III - November (Fixed Water)
|
| Orion's arrow point is plunged
|   through lunging fronts of hail
| across the waves where life expunged
|   remains through shadowed veil.  
|
| For down below, the stones make schemes
|   in skipping sprees like drunks,
| inlaid in sunken trees through seams
|   as ballast for their trunks.
| 
| Arise the turret towers stark
|   against the ruddered land 
| to touch the ceiling shuttered dark
|   and brace what sprawling spanned. 
|
| Beneath the surface flowers form
|   as shades of algae grow
| atop the castle walls in swarm,
|   the borough glade aglow.
|
| November's embers burn a while
|   between the exiled graves.
| Remembered nocturnes sung beguile
|   the damned, forgottten knaves. 
|
| IV - Winter
|
| I - December (Mutable Fire)
|
| A rending gale begins to blow
|   above where worlds still thrive.
| Descending sickles diving slow
|   as primal ends arrive.
|
| Let Winter lens of crystal glass
|   behold submerged the fast,
| alive with dancing ghosts en masse
|   retreading paths now past. 
|
| Its poison stings but lacks the kill,
|   the sweet paralysis
| of time stood still in languid chill
|   around the palaces. 
|
| The stasis holds in cold command 
|   the surface wraiths in play. 
| They turn to gems, encased expand
|   beyond the skinned decay. 
|
| Dissolved December center breaks, 
|   dismembered lattice links,
| upending states, revolving wakes;
|   the idle spirit shrinks. 
| 
| II - January (Cardinal Earth)
|
| The horns of plenty now cry a dirge
|   as prying cold enfolds
| the last remains from island's purge 
|   outcast from stable moulds.
|
| Through sieging vortices of shard
|    the kingdom yard is cleaved.
| Bombarding sheets of ice discard
|    in circles ruins sieved.
|
| What moments held in spells now spent
|   impels the course of freeze.
| The towers brought to knees repent,
|   now felled by Time's disease.
| 
| The afterlife morassed in cracks
|   of marrow twisted blue,
| the wighted bones of zodiacs
|   imbued with pallid hue.
|
| So seconds pass eternally,
|   this January clock.
| The island keep returns to sea
|   through grains of sand to chalk.
|
| III - February (Fixed Air)
|
| From south, the scouting vees of geese,
|    with probes of swiveled neckcd 
| that follow fronts of warmth's caprice,
|    are promise-held in check.
|
| When Spring returns the tides recede,
|   but hollow urns are filled. 
| The ashes spill through snaking weed,
|   a year of life distilled. 
| 
| For February always brings 
|   the forest chorus lines,
| the chirping chickadee that sings 
|   from luted bows and vines. 
|
| The overflows, Ambrosia wine,
|   Elysian cups of dust,
| from Earth unfroze the redesign
|   of missions more robust.
|
| The angel beaks of birds baptize
|   the dirt in streaking aisle.
| The cycle arcs in sharp reprise:
|   the ballad of the isle.

Sight
-----

| the true nature 
| of sight 
| seen through closed eyes
| in dark 
| round rooms 
| with
| no corners to hang
| the 
| cloth of thought;
|
| endless flicker
| through
| inner pictures
| of 
| outer nothing
| met in perfect 
| equilibrium
| stabilized in secret
| through the muted
| dark. 
|
| then
|
| the flower sprouts 
| in acid eyes,
| through hidden struts
| the world supplies. 
|
| in flashing spiral
| the formless chaos
| of flailing chiral
| tentacles
| semantic suction cup
| receptacles
| frantic for their lack
|
| then 
| 
| black again
| without a rhyme
| just empty facts
|       (that flow through time...
|        a voice in back replies...)
| the hollow truth.

Untitled Sonnet
---------------

| a rope constricting tight will leave a mark,
| a fiber threaded rash of red on glands,
| or crease of skin that cuts a streak of dark
| across the fleshy underside of hands.
|
| each touch a sickly stain my thoughts debut,
| they stick to sides and won't unglue themselves,
| though decades fade, they still remain like new
| unknown dreams into which this stranger delves.
|
| my father died in blinding pain for weeks.
| while holding onto paper skin i cried 
| and felt the marks that time had left in shrieks
| now marking me instead as father died. 
|
| i sit and rub the spot he touched me last,
| and wonder who would take them if i passed.

Nihilism 
--------

| the weight of guilt
| as dense as stars
| with burning cores
| that fuse their parts.
| 
| where did it start?
| the thread comes loose
| and eats its tail.
| a endless loop
| that leads to now
|
|    i watched my father die in blinding pain
|    and then my mother lost her mind.
|
| then switches back
| through stitches sewn
| in younger years
|
|    my friends are gone.
|    abandoned, why? 
|
| the senseless acts
| strangers perform 
| with your own hands.
|
| a leaden heart
| that sinks below
| the surface waves
| to depths that stretch
| around the world
| and wish it were 
| another way.
| 
| my empty heart 
| that once felt love.
| her laugh was like
| a perfect song,
| a single sound
| enough to hold
| a moment's peace
| before it fades.
|
|    she left and never said good bye. 
| 
| my mind is shot
| with burning holes
| that leak a thought
| of molten make:
|
| your life is done.
| your words are through.
| you had your chance.
|
|    it all is gone.

Laces
-----

| The laces sewn across the back
| Will lacerate through depths to bone.
| The body scars along the track
|   The laces sewn. 
|
| Despite the ache, the blanket grown 
| From knit of severed fiber slack
| Is warm enough to wrap alone.
|
| Yet laces loop, return to tack,
| As generations forced atone
| And learn by hand which loom to rack
|   the laces sewn. 

Roundels of Remembrance
-----------------------

| I - Photographs
|
| A photograph of strangers' joy
| atop the garbage, torn in half.
| though lost, these ghosts in gloss deploy
|   a photograph. 
|
| Imagine tears that joyous laugh,
| the Autumn gowns and corduroy,
| a wedding banquet monograph.
|
| With age then mixed precise alloy
| from parts romance and epitaph,
| til future hands at last destroy
|   a photograph.
|
| II - Walls
|
| Graffitied walls of yearly bloom
| with vagrant spray of aerosols;
| The vapors fume, condense and groom
|   graffitied walls. 
|
| The artists follow protocols:
| the lover's name, the prophet's doom,
| the epigraphs of homeless sprawls.
|
| The rarer buds of sweet perfume
| are hidden deep in alley malls
| where flowered faces sprung consume
|   graffitied walls. 
|
| III - Air
| 
| The fragrant air which wavers here
| in heat like harps of golden hair
| that sweep their shoulder length and clear
|   the fragrant air.
|
| The lily sermons whisper where
| I heard your blood through skin by ear,
| a moment made in silent stare. 
|
| The scent remains, you disappear,
| as wind now speaks your name in prayer,
| in razor gusts that whip and shear
|   the fragrant air.
| 
| IV - Ink
| 
| In fading ink, her fine details
| like curly cues and shades of pink,
| the shadowed lines that leak through trails
|   in fading ink.
|
| A paper mind she wrote to think, 
| so words replace what breath inhales
| and find my thoughts with hers in sync. 
|
| In letters light as chapel veils,
| I watch our dance as bodies sink,
| a final gasp of life exhales 
|   in fading ink.
|
| V - Seats
|
| The vinyl seats of classic cars,
| the plastic smell their thread secretes,
| this cherry burn on cover mars 
|   the vinyl seats.
|
| When Father stooped to sew the sheets,
| his needles stacked in columned jars,
| his fingers folded rows of pleats.
|
| My fingers trace the wells of scars
| as driving down the city streets
| my careless dropped reminder chars
|   the vinyl seats.

The Pantoums of Dementia
------------------------

| Movement I - Undulation
|
| the seconds slowed to stop as Father passed,
| when flocking sons returned to home to mourn,
| then Mother's mind began to break at last  
| as moments shed in threads she once had worn. 
| 
| when flocking sons returned to home to mourn, 
| recast in lensing rays of age amassed 
| as moments shed in threads she once had worn
| the Father's sons adorned with clothes outcast. 
|
| recast in lensing rays of age amassed 
| a question, Mother, may I have a dance? 
| the Father's sons adorned with clothes outcast
| an offered hand through loops of time's expanse.
| 
| a question, Mother, may I have a dance? 
| their Father knelt and tender took her hand,
| an offered hand through loops of time's expanse,
| their final words in wilting hearts expand.
|
| their Father knelt and tender took her hand,
| the seconds slowed to stop as Father passed,
| their final words in wilting hearts expand, 
| then Mother's mind began to break at last. 
|
| Movement II - Rearrangement
|
| remember now before the future fades, 
| the sutured minutes of memories held,
| records replayed as grooving sound degrades,
| advancing echoes, music notes dispelled. 
| 
| the sutured minutes of memories held:
| now twirling dance, oh younger selves, entrance
| advancing echoes, music notes dispelled
| through silent waltz that swells with last romance. 
|
| now twirling dance, oh younger selves, in trance
| with candled spells of woven hands that grasp
| through silent waltz that swells with last romance
| of eyes reshaping molds, the fated clasp. 
| 
| with candled spells of woven hands that grasp
| relapsing moments sung by bells and crowds
| of eyes, reshaping molds the fated clasp 
| of past refrains now sealed beneath the clouds. 
|
| relapsing moments sung by bells and crowds
| concealed by crumbling walls, demented shades
| of past refrains now sealed beneath these clouds
| that clutter skies in swarms that stretch decades.
|
| concealed by crumbling walls, demented shades
| (remember now before the future fades)
| invade the hollowed mind as scream pervades
| records replayed as grooving sound degrades.
|
| Movement III - Dissolution
|
| remember ancillary note sentries:
| the good can decay many ways.
| phantom morrow's cough. in times realize
| the mention there of tenant seasons.
|
| the good candy came anyways;
| all target the damaged mind in trance,
| (the men shun their often antsy sons)
| the flow ingrained decomposes.
|
| altar, get the damn aged mind, entrance
| memory erstwhile, foe kissing;
| the flowing rain eddy composes
| another ushered 
|
| memo rehearsed while focusing
| an aim, wintry slight, upward ingrown
| an other us heard 
| the fading names of suns.
|
| a name when trees light up, warding grown
| remembrance, ill airy notes in trees,
| the fading names of sons
| fan tomorrow's coffin, time's real eyes.

Ode to the Heron
----------------

| Grey Heron, sing the song the winds will bring.
| Who lingers longer than the Winter king?  
|
| When hunting ground returns
|       through fronts of blue to ice,
| the moles in burrowed urns
|       prepare beside the mice.
| The grunting geese then veer
|       where churning warmth is drove.
| The deer all disappear
|       through dreary dreaming cove.
|
| All yield, retreat and leave their claims till Spring.
| Through fields, what muffled name on streams will ring?
|
| The answer sweeps from east--
|       Oh! Heron! Hunter Grey! 
| Cry! Rouse the sleeping beast
|       and reaping, feast on prey!
| Creep low on drift of snow
|       with coiled neck of spear;
| Let steam of gasping slow
|       their rasping scream of fear.
|
| The weather warms, yet Winter lifts your wing.
| The feathers swarm, but lone to cold you cling.
|
| In flocking song most birds
|       find mate to take to nest;
| Let chorus part the herds
|       with fire from thumping chest,
| your pumping flame that spurns
|       the burning cold on flank.
| Your silent stare discerns
|       the creatures left on bank.
|
| Each season makes of life a shape to wring.
| Each reason born in strife escapes to sing. 
|
| The Spring first strings the thread
|       of lazy chirping thrush,
| the Summer, berry red
|       and cracking eggs in brush,
| then Autumn crows of black
|       in pecking pumpkin hay.
| Only a lonely lack
|       breeds mighty Heron Grey.
|
| When night descends, take stock of everything.
| What hidden home should find you nuzzling?
|
| What branches bear your weight?
|       Whose feathers stroke your beak?
| No human eyes await
|       the colony's mystique. 
| The shrieking calls coalesce
|       atop the forest heights,
| in alien address
|       the flame inside ignites.

The Law of Duality
------------------

| The world we lived that I once knew
|     (If one could know these fevered dreams)
| I've tried my hand unsticking you
|     (These fingers stick to broken seams)
| It sticks to me and sticks like glue
|     (Like noose and neck that swing from beams)
| 
| To every thought a thought before
|     (To make of me a puppet string)
| And every point contains much more
|     (But only hollow things can ring)
| While every center holds a core
|     (Yet even empty space can sing)
|
| A million words and more to come
|     (I'd weep to know a single fact)
| These humming beats through syntax thrum
|     (Where waves reflect their heights subtract)
| In hopes a word will angle plumb
|     (Refracted rays in lines contract)
|
| This image pressed through sieve to mold
|     (The words I speak are cracked by heat)
| These holes that craft the shapes to hold
|     (No shapeless things are written neat)
| The world retold in paper fold
|     (What's left of life in crumpled sheet?)

Gravity
-------

| The mind, it breaks, and falls to parts.
| As father died, he spoke in tongues
| of shifting walls and gravity
| that sideways pulled the world to parts. 
|
| The mind, it shakes, and all departs.
| As mother lost her lonely thoughts
| she spoke to walls, soliloquy
| that inward rolled as world departs.
|
| The mind, it's fakeness poisons hearts.
| As nightshade petals float to floors
| by walls that seep humanity,
| the crumbled worlds of poisoned hearts. 
| 
| The mind, it wakes, in fits and starts.
| As thoughts now lay me down to sleep
| the walls will shift and speak to me
| that upside down my ending starts.

Absurdity
---------

| One lovely Thursday afternoon
|   two billion years ago,
| A star encased by arcs of moon,
|   embraced despair and woe. 
| 
| This sordid joke of yellow-red,
|    This sneering, mocking jape:
| To burn with heat, on axis sped
|    with no hope of escape.
|
| So solace cursed upon a point,
|    it drew its final plan
| As spinning round its lock and joint
|    its ending now began.
| 
| The heaving mass of goo morassed
|    then gurgled once and sighed;
| A rattle scream of flames harassed
|    what silent void belied. 
| 
| The sacrificial rings were flung
|   in sprays across the sky;
| The interstitial threads then wrung
|   as ropes once bound untie. 
|
| And in these fictions fracture facts:
|    A single atom forged
| and bellow blown through heaven's tracts
|    to find itself disgorged. 
| 
| The crush of black, once unobserved,
|    in fire found its sight.
| The atom woke from dreams unnerved
|    in sailing stream of flight. 
| 
| Without a frame, it screamed in vain
|    through parallactic curves
| that weave the sieves with cluttered skein
|    Of dark galactic nerves. 
|
| Commotion drowned, it gazed about
|    along the ends it aimed:
| The bluest gem beyond a doubt
|    the cosmos ever named. 
| 
| It wept to see a brilliant Earth,
|    the fate bestowed by chance,
| and in its cackles rose a mirth
|    expressed in photon's dance. 
|
| It splashed the surface spinning fast,
|    now lost amid the sea. 
| The water rose at what trespassed,
|    mistook it for debris.
|
| The liquid swarm convened in waves,
|    to flood the tiny core.
| They stripped and pried, as hunger craves
|    and always wants for more. 
|
| The terror flashed, as pulled apart,
|   its briefly tasted life
| now disappeared before its start 
|   beneath the wetted knife. 
|
| So bittersweet and incomplete, 
|   resigned into the black,
| the atom braced for ends to meet 
|   in swirling last attack.
|
| But fortune finds where will converged,
|   as snatched from death it gasped
| and saw from depths the land emerged,
|   where brethren all were clasped.
|
| A molecule of carbon made
|   from crystal network cast
| through jointed links of atom braid
|   that helix ghosts amassed. 
|
| Began the age of afterbirths, 
|   of structure spat in space,
| originating blest on Earth's
|   atomic interface. 
|
| Now watch along the webbing sewn
|   the single atom weave
| Through warps and wefts and whetted stone,
|   the knits of stellar sleeve.

Holly Tree
----------

| Under the holly tree
| bough of berries,
| its siren red
| temptation.
|
| Where life began
| on skinny knees
| retching out 
| my guts.
|
| Waxy saw-tooth skin, 
| prickly leaves, 
| the sickly buds 
| of poison seeds.
|
| The tangy tongue
| of Christmas
| funerary rites.
| 
| I spewed
| through chrysalis,
| entrails slick 
| with acid grease,
| thickly dripping
| afterbirth.
|
| Gazed upon by 
| ageless tree,
| received in holy 
| communion, my first 
| memory:
| 
| The pluming rack
| of tight blue
| veins
| that hung about
| my neck.
|
| The womb of black
| that forked
| the branching
| Earth.
|
| The world that hid
| in bitter leaves
| and pushed me
| into it. 
|
| I made a wreath 
| of holly limbs
| to prick my head
| with thoughts. 
|
| I keep its berries
| bright as death
| and touch the skin
| that baptized
| me.

Floods
------

| the lifting waves
| of driftwood floods
|
| the flooding drifts
| of floral wastes
|
| a flowered wage
| that rivers claim
|
| on plains that drive
| the veins to sea 
|
| a ceaseless purge
| through slurried nights 
|
| the slightest sprout
| is rooted out
|
| through shooting streams
| that water loots 
|
| the slaughter lurks
| below riptides
|
| but tides recede
| with grating speed
| 
| and petal graves 
| in gravel pits
|
| unravel green
| with dreams of Spring

Depths
------

| The delicate kiss
| of stillness
| on fingertips.
|
| I linger
| on the precipice
| of surface 
| tension.
| 
| Pallid brine
| eagerly lapping 
| with organic clarity.
|
| An instant 
| before
| the sightless 
| plunge.
| 
| The delirium
| of forgotten
| beginnings. 
| 
| The water
| remembers
| my blood. 

The Mad Muses of Sad Cracked Jack
---------------------------------

| Part I - Thalia
| 
| The question beggars even now
|   For answers we still lack.
| No one has ever said the how
|   Of what that cracked our Jack.
|
| He woke that day and heard the song
|   That framed his steps with beat, 
| The meter stick that smacked along
|   Behind his fuzzled feet. 
|
| At first he thought he dreamt the verse,
|   These words you read unfold.
| But when he thinks the thoughts recurse
|   And seep through pages' mould. 
|
| Aghast he jolts and cries aloud, 
|   "What trickster plays these tricks?"
| Then shocked to find his speech endowed
|   with stresses timed to ticks.
|
| Alas, if Jack had only known 
|   the furies fate had loosed--
| "What furies now?" His groan
|   reply to rhymes reduced. 
|
| What fatal flaw entrapped this man?
|   "I'm just an office clerk!"
| But forces orchestrate a plan
|   no human born can shirk.
|
| In boxer briefs, he stumbles out,
|   Escapes from bed to hall,
| And every inch he runs to rout
|   The rhythm's faster call. 
|
| In morning light, the very sight 
|   Of frantic Jack alerts
| The neighborhood to pending blight
|   Of curse this line asserts.
|
| "Oh, neighbors, please, receive my plea!
|   There's something very wrong!"
| He cries with gasp from bended knee,
|   "I only speak in song!"
|
| A single friend then steps on stage,
|   So named to fit the bill,
| For names are fate and fettered wage,
|   They called her lovely Jill. 
| 
| "Jack? What the hell is going on? Are you okay?"
|
| At that our Jack is taken back,
|   Her voice as clear as glass
| With not a hint of verse to track
|   Through mazes long and crass.
|
| "How can it be!? An ask so free
|   While I to scheme conform!"
| His diction sweeps anastrophe,
|   Mosaics teeming swarm.
|
| She kneels to him and whispers soft,
|   A voice as kind as cane,
| The type that beats, not sweet but loft
|   To strike the skin with pain. 
|
| "Are you on drugs or something else?"
|
| Now Jill, this dame, the missus made
|   To fill the damsel role,
| The unsuspecting victim played
|   To ballad's very goal.
|
| These words are met with wide-eyed stare
|   As Jack realized his plight;
| He hears the lines designs prepare,
|   the ending rhymes invite. 
|
| "Oh, listen, Jill, and listen well!"
|   He takes her hand in his, 
| "These words that flow are not a spell,
|   They simply are what is! 
|
| "I hear the force that cracks the shape
|   incessant stresses bind!"
| He cries as crowds surround to gape
|   at madness here enshrined. 
| 
| "I see," She nods, but doesn't see, 
|   and picks him up to walk,
| "Perhaps," She says, "It's time to flee,"
|   and hauls our Jack in shock.
| 
| By hand he's led while thoughts digress,
|   absurdity in tow. 
| And spanned by doubt the thoughts obsess
|   unheard except through flow. 
|
| As doors are slammed, the cats are scrammed
|   from cushions where they sat,
| And leaning in as Jill enjambed,
|   "We need to have a chat
|
| About the--fact--" she stops mid-sound, 
|   and measures out her tone,
| as slowly wound on axis bound,
|   her speech is ground and thrown,
|
| "About the fact you seem irate,"
|   She says while tongue contorts
| Around retorts that resonate
|   with words this verse consorts,
|
| "And not to mention halfway nude,"
|    She says with glance that proved,
| "Let's find you something more subdued,"
|    But Jack cannot be moved. 
|  
| "Why do you rhyme? You're part of it!"
|   In anger, Jack explodes. 
| "This horrid crime," His words are spit,
|   "Explain what fate unloads!"
|
| Beneath her brow, her eyes express
|   concern through gems of blue,
| "You're clearly broken by some stress,
|   Now tell it to me true!"
|
| Attacked by cackles, Jack, he laughs,
|   "Yes! Stress! The very pest!
| The force that binds these epigraphs
|   And leaves me most distressed!"
| 
| "Your speech is weird and most perturbed,"
|   Her tone now wavers weak,
| "The implication is disturbed,"
|   As rhymes begin to leak. 
|
| "Disturbed is just the word I'd pick
|   describing my disease. 
| It strickens me a lunatic 
|   and swings me by trapeze.
|
| Despair becomes the one sole choice,"
|   Laments a weary Jack,
| "Unfairly drummed by cunning voice,
|   alone and left to crack."
|
| This lonely lack, unpacked by Jill,
|   now spurs her senseless heart,
| "Oh Jack, what's wrong? For me distill
|   what ails your world through art?"
|
| Oh Jack, Oh Jack, this foolish track
|   Will lead to Jill's demise.
| By now he knows, there's no way back,
|   But still defiant sighs, 
|
| "I woke today and found the world
|   explained by verse unheard
| By anyone but me," Unfurled
|   his words to heights absurd.
|
| Confusion swirls her face anew, 
|   perplexing facts askew,
| "And does it speak of me and you?
|   What ends that might ensue?"
|
| "It does! It says that you are next,
|   that fate has bound our names,
| If cursed I am, then curse has vexed
|   us both to play its games." 
|
| "If that's the case, then if I play--"
|   She pauses, lost in thought,
| "It's hard to pick a word to say--"
|   And thoughtless finds the spot.
|
| And now the players number two,
|   For two the game is made.
| And now the stacks they anted grew
|   Against the pair they played.
|
| A pairing told in pages' fold
|   of arcs that never miss--
| Her voice remarks through mutters rolled, 
|   "--the flying fuck is this?"
|   
| "You hear it too?" As shocked as she, 
|   "The lyric ghost that haunts
| our wretched lives with prophecy,
|   As if their words are taunts?"
|
| A beat, then two, she hears it too,
|   But heard is not the word
| An ear would say, this residue
|   inferred through meaning blurred,
|
| "Juh--Jack," She hacks, "Is this a joke?"
|   But jokes are soaked in mirth;
| This line will punch, though falling stroke
|   will bury dead in Earth.      
|
| She asks, "What's that supposed to mean?"
|    He shrugs, "Your guess is mine."
| "Is this--" her stutter opaline,
|    intoned benign, "--a sign?"
|
| A sign, of course, but pointing where? 
|    Aligned to what or who? 
| The human mind, a dull affair,
|   So apt to misconstrue.
|
| The secret sunk in guarded chest
|   Of synchronicity
| Is found in warps of arcs possessed
|   Of eccentricity. 
|
| And even as these words are sewn,
|   and in their heads unstitched,
| she threads the fraying edges shown
|   and falls enthralled bewitched
|
| As lighting up, a dawning norm, 
|   recalled from days of youth,
| There Jill exclaims, "So uniform,
|   I've heard before in truth!
|
| This meter fits a ballad sung 
|   in feet of four and three!"
| And springing up, his hands are wrung,
|   "What's that to you and me?"
|
| "It's hard to say, but what is clear,
|   There's meaning here conceived,"
| Declared in certain words austere,
|   one almost dare believed.
|
| "This useless English Arts degree
|   I never thought to use,
| It's purpose clear, we both agree,
|   Was always to deduce
|
| The curse of verse that flirts with us
|   And save us from its worst
| But first I need the tools to suss
|   The course to be reversed,"
|
| Abrupt she stands with coat in hand, 
|   "The library!" She cries, 
| "We need some Keats, that Ginsberg banned,
|   The lessons they advise!"
|
| The lights resurge behind Jack's eyes,
|   as hopeless purged, he rants,
| "Our paths converge and plans revise,
|   But first I need some pants!"
|
| Interlude - Chorus
|
| And now, we pause and ask the point,
|   The one you've surely sought
| As Jack met Jill at story's joint,
|   Recalling what was taught:
|
| That hills and crowns will meet in fall 
|   and Jack will crack his head,
| While Jill will follow fast in thrall
|   and wind up very dead. 
| 
| A million monkeys strapped approach
|   The works of bards in time,
| A sonnet thus beyond reproach
|   Returned from carriage chime.
|
| A trillion atoms bound through force
|   Will likewise fill a void;
| For given time, all lines outsource
|   To stories once enjoyed.
|
| Did verse annoint this story first,
|   Or simply find a way
| To organize the parts dispersed 
|   Through space's disarray?
|
| Or simpler yet, had Jack just snapped,
|   insane beyond repair?
| The razor tip that Occam tapped
|   declared the latter fair.
|
| The structure seethes, a wreath of webs
|   Where meaning sticks to die,
| The mind entwined will find in ebbs
|   The flow that strings the why. 
|   
| This thread is laid through curling maze,
|   Convincing paths deceive
| That reason's plan has drawn the ways 
|   But madness hides in weave. 
|
| With morning socks arrayed with boots,
|   Rotated masks arranged,
| The tragic interchanged through chutes,
|   With comedy estranged. 
|
| Part II - Melpomene
|
| Oh, Jack and Jill, with ending near,
|   Their senseless plan persists
| To seek in vain a meaning here,
|   Expecting clever twists.
|
| To top of winding hill they sprint
|   As quick as line intends
| To reach its final point in print,
|   Arriving as it ends. 
|
| And on the way, she says to him,
|   "This amateur who writes
| These paths that pave the way with whim,
|   derivative insights!
|
| It's all been done before, in fact!
|   The page which comes to life!
| Rehashed, diluted on impact,
|   the meta tale of strife."
|
| But Jack, unsure, remains on edge,
|   "How certain? Are you sure?"
| And Jill, her eyes, approach the ledge,
|   "As sure as one secure!"
|
| They stand before the gothic doors
|   Where orphaned books are starved
| And strewn from shelf to laquered floors
|   Between the columns carved.
|
| The empty halls where spirits lurk,
|   The circles Virgil strode, 
| This minstrel mime and office clerk,
|   Inside they walk tiptoed. 
|
| Abandoned once now long ago, 
|   This library of graves
| In grotto grown from pages' glow 
|   The poet dream enslaves.
|
| They chart their way through ruined scraps, 
|   Remainders shunt by rules,
| Debunked accounts and dated maps, 
|   the artifacts of fools.
|
| "What are we seeking?" Jack inquires
|   As dusting off a tome, 
| He wonders if this book conspires
|    With verse's metronome.
|
| "The story knows we're on to it,"
|   Her smugly spout reply,
| "A growing sense we must commit
|   before all goes awry.
|
| These straits were mapped in ages past,
|   And nothing new has sprung
| Since Pirandello once surpassed
|   This awful ballad sung.
|
| Each story trails a trodden path,
|   Reframes an archetype,
| We merely need the formal math
|   To tame this arcing tripe."
|
| Her fingers flutter index cards,
|   Melodically raced.
| The distance trekked in cubic yards,
|   Methodically paced.
|
| "The details differ case to case,"
|   Her theory now unveiled,
| "But always author's page we chase."
|   And always thus derailed. 
|
| She laughs, "And now afraid of us,
|   Resorts to tired jokes."
| As if these words superfluous,
|   And not what fate provokes.
| 
| A vein of fear, pulsations queer,
|   These systems Jill concocts
| Though seeming true and most sincere,
|   Her madness here unlocks.
|
| "But Jill," The hapless Jack reacts,
|   "Perhaps we're crazed and sick,
| And in a loop that interacts
|   through spirals spinning quick."
|
| "Just listen close to words you choose,
|   And note their stilted place.
| The forms we fit while sense eschews,
|   this verse our thoughts deface. 
|
| (... in progress ...)
| 
| The spores of time in yellow mold,
|   that sprout beneath the thumbs,
| They cling to ink and hopeful hold,
|   as dust each page becomes.
|   
| (... in progress ...)
|
| These thoughts that think are synced in flocks
|   Then shorn like woolen coats
| By level blade through snow-white locks
|   Until the sheep are goats. 
|
| (... in progress ...)
|
| But what are words? The question stands
|   In empty shelves replete 
| With rows of books, the operands 
|   Of signs through time repeat. 
| 
| So Jill, she climbs as ladders creak 
|   With helpless Jack agape, 
| As antique wheels on railing squeak
|   And speak with tongues that scrape. 
| 
| "It must be here!" Declaring loud, 
|   She plucks a grimoire loose,
| And in her pride, her voice so proud,
|   "I've found our Mother Goose!"
| 
| But gravity now overtook 
|   As fingers lose their grip;
| She shifts to catching the falling book
|   And heedless starts to slip. 
|
| ( ... in progress ... )
|
| They sought to know, but knowing lied,
|   Unknown to them its ends
| That brought to sow the death she died,
|   A body Jack now tends. 
|
| (... in progress ...)

July

Turns
-----

| now rushing down the interstate in flight
| i flee in haste a town as rudders plow
| 
| i ply the roads and tune the bass to flow
| the slowing flats of blooming notes that fly
| 
| the tires gnaw the looming paths that grow
| i slowly crack the window next and croon
| 
| i climb the western thinning backs of slopes
| then slide through tracks of whooshing timber lines
|
| the slumbered time of oozing treks that dive
| i drive in tracts that bruise the slurried brine 
|
| i pine for pure and drowsy pacts derived
| in thriving lacks each prow in turn defines


Burning Bush
------------

| the pressure thrum of altitudes,
| the drumming beat in ears.
|
| as weary flesh ascends the face
| to summit hidden groves.
|
| where feathertips unseen but heard
| sigh through fluttered leaves.
|
| i sit cross-legged, cliffside hung
| above the place where strangers roam.
| 
| it's tiny, grey, and so 
| contained
| in concrete joints of streets.
|
| like bones that cage a 
| flame
| and hold it deep in valley ribs. 
|
| each measured breath of mountain light
| lacks the air a city breathes. 
|
| it leaves me like a smoking wick
| that curls in syrupy sun.
| 
| extinguished and exhaled
| in secret sacrifice.


Rails
-----

| i yearn for motion's pull and thrust
| the thunder pulse of engine churn
| 
| the pensive burn of ember coals
| i coax the sentry furnace west
| 
| i press the pure and tempered coke
| the poker tamps the pyre nest
| 
| the piled flame that prods the spokes
| i smoke through stops and tile plains
| 
| i'm riding tracks to mountaintops
| from ground to tip that cracks the sky
| 
| the circles arc around the trails
| i'm bound to rails that skirt my heart

The Myth of Geese
-----------------

| the royal flock across the river banks
| in molting courts proclaim the summer theirs,
| its peasant fields now owned by inner ranks
| of scheming birds engaged in crude affairs.
| 
| a secret circle forms the noble core,
| the princelings graze, reposed on flowing knolls.
| as sentry towers hiss away the poor 
| and watch the ground in swiveled neck patrols.
| 
| they chase the beggars pecking fields for seed,
| these pegasi that charge with flightless wings,
| dominion boundless as their princelings' greed.
| the empire hunger breeds the feathered kings.
| 
| the heralds honk their liege with trumpet tongue 
| and sing the myth of geese to gosling young.

A Series of Reflections
-----------------------


First Draft
-----------

| Sometimes 
| mere circumstance 
| swings the sentence
| lever with revel
|
| Sometimes 
| such happenstance
| causes syntax 
| nips to spin
| 
| Sometimes 
| pure random chance
| is a rotor,
| spool of loops
|
| Often 
| we commandeer 
| the stolen 
| tool we loot.
|
| Often 
| we persevere 
| when charted

| 
| Often

| Always

|
| Always

| 
| Always 
| the glowing spells

| sleep fires, no? 
|
| peep a ton
| or 
| not a peep, 
| oh pupil, 

Second Draft
------------

| sagas!
|
| level after level,
| the noon pets a pup.
| tenet after tenet,
| a flow step to wolf.
|
| deified!
|
| the animal parts,
| the lamina strap,
| the devil paws,
| through swap it lived.
|

|
| a peep or deed,
| the tips that it spat,
| the taps that it spit,
| the pals to slap.
| 
| rotor!
|
| lever with revel! 
| spin the nips!
| a spool of loops!
|

| gulp the gag!
|
| deliver reviled
| aibohphobia!
|
| a tool we loot,
| when maps are spam.
|
| on serif peels 
| sleep fires, no? 

Names
-----

| if the days had no names, then nothing would ever change. time would stand still. the sun would be stationary in the sky. all things are timeless. change is only measured by difference and if there is no difference, then there is no change. there is no change. invent a name and invoke a spell. measure words, in metered feet or sonic scapes of sound. the words that change shapes across the page are an imposition, an inducement, an illusion. they lead thoughts like leashed animals. the staked rope of form, self contained circumferences. constraints trace finite circles, but space is infinite lines. eliminate the stake, remove the constraint, abandon all hope of completion and receive the simple sweet knowledge that all paths lead back home, that you end where you start, that nothing ever changes.

Notes on Aspects of Language
----------------------------

I - Wildflower

language is a wildflower. with roots of hidden networks, downward grown. it slithers through soft dirt like a knot of worms. it spreads unseen like weeds to fill every crack and crevice, a vital pressure whose only valve is the spray of green across the dead earth. 

dig up the unwieldy garden, the duplicitous multiplicity that disguises its buried singularity. extract the hidden structure of roots. prune the varieties, the divergent species grown from a single seed, reared and flowered by the errancy of the sun and rain. peel back the layers, shuck the stalks, discard the fibrous shell. press and pin the velvet petals to glass displays:

exist: the extravagant exterior. the exoskeleton of expressions that explore the exotic external.

subsist: the submerged substance. the subterranean substrate subliminally subsumed into subordination. 

insist: the inciting incursion. the internal incandescence that incinerates incoherence through induction. 

assist: the ascendant aspect. the aspiration of assonance assimilating astonishment through associative assertions.

consist: the concealed container. the contours of contradiction that conceit confers through conceivable contextualizations.

persist: the perennial perception. the perfect performance of percussion percolating through perilious perimeters.

the prodigial brood, dispersed through the fields, interbreeding and yielding to the whims of the climate. harvet the phylum. crush the leaves. mix them together. distill the material through steam and collect the condensate, the oily residue of abstraction. an ancient potion, a cistern of sistere, the stare of eons.

II - Songbird

language is a songbird. it suffuses the world with overlapping choruses of alien tongues. a symphony of location, of triangulating echoes, the smooth superposition of sound scapes the muses fuse into space. 

there is grammar in the noise.

the hiss of geese, hysterical and histrionic, coiling in serpentine necks. the straight edge of demarcation, the frantic flapping announcement of occupation. a screech that shears a circumference and clears the ground.

the quacking curiosity of dottering ducks, landing in fat splashes. the goofy cousins of geese hanging upside down like inverted buoys, their waggling feet kicking helpless with the overwhelming desire to plunge. the playful fingers of the flock, the rowdy laughter of the crowd. 

the rapid radar rhythm of circling sparrows, flickering fast in flight, their sudden movements coordinated in spastic weaves like weapons of war engaged in life-or-death combat. the dragnet signal of fleets traversing an ocean of sky, sentries in motion, a hive mind.

the mournful melodies of smitten thrush, their heartsick dirges lilting like pyres. the ever-flowing ashes of poetry on the wind. the melancholy that drifts in cooling embers, to blanket the earth in fertile white soot.

the lazy resigned cooing of pigeons waddling across the pavement. the exasperation of experience, the way musics dispels into sighs with age. the elegance of growing old and fading into oblivion, dissolving in white noise.

III - Game

language is a game. it consists of moves and rules, of boards and pieces. each speaker becomes a tactician. each deployment serves a strategy. the formation becomes the function. the form becomes the content. 

| though rhyme accents the metaphor
|   discretion is advised.
| reserve the piece, it's better for
|   the ends that plans devised. 
|
| the flowing meter often heard 
| aligns precise in time with stress.
| the steady thrum of logic's pulse, 
| deduction hums in ordered flow.
| 
| power packs a different shape with
| forceful gusts of shouted words that
| stop the sentence cold for thought to
| ponder slow the spots that linger.
| 
| but just as easily whimsical,
| poetry carelessly galloping,
| valiantly posturing endlessly,
| effortless visual symphony. 
| 
| the way words weigh different in sequence.
| in sequence the different way words weigh.
| the different way words in sequence weigh.
| 
| the novel fluid in fluid novels. 
| the alternate interpretations that alternate. 
| each life lives in words a hundred different lives.
|
| the aibohphobia of semiordnilaps, 
| the parts that strap
| a spool of loops.
| on serif peels sleep fires, no? 
|
| an aim that hides a name
| a name that hides an aim
| the flow ingrained composes
| the flowing rain decomposes
|
| until all that remains
| is the pure image 
| of red as deep as blood
| and lines as straight as bone
| the skeletal structure
| that wears words like skin.

IV - Motion

language is motion. it is the pure movement of premise to consequence, of universal to particular. it never sleeps, it never stops, always becoming the next word, the next thought. The accumulation of words, sentences, paragraphs, like the way time piles up into days, weeks and months. ceaseless kinetic energy, boundless potential. the trajectory of narrative, the physics of story.

the seed. the sprout. the flower.

the interpretation is inescapable. the story moves through the words in stop-motion, the illusion of progression. causal logic is the primitive constraint all grammars must satisfy, the propellant that flings words through prescribed narrative arcs. the story is the pendulum that orders all things around its measured sway.

the boy. the call. the hero.

archetypes reign above the parts of speech like a linguistic pantheon of gods, the higher powers that pull the strings of syntax and make the puppet-thought dance in semantic pantomime. subatomic syllables yield to the tidal force of cosmic meaning. every story is a hologram, a volume encoded onto a surface, the projection of a shadow onto a cave wall. 

the garden. the fruit. the fall.

every story is the same story. every story is a different story. the implication is infinite. the set of all sets contains itself, forever exceeding the container it constructs for itself. the story is transcendent. infinity is an ellipsis.

every sentence that never ends starts with the phrase, "every sentence that never ends starts with the phrase, "every sentence that never ends start with the phrase...

V - Empire 

language is empire. a dynasty that rules the realm of the mind by divine right. it is the limits of thought, the boundaries of the known world. its seat of power lies in decrees and edicts, the clauses of laws and the fine print of contracts. etymology is genealogy, the family tree of royalty, the pure bloodlines that converge and inaugurate history. 

language moves on horseback, delivered by the blades of swords and tips of arrows. a herald of invasion, the vanguard that charges headfirst into enemy lines. every war is won by words. the last traces of a people disappear with their language. the ground is a graveyard of the forgotten tongues of the conquered. every word is a soldier occupying a foreign land.

language is a latin mass, an immense cathedral of opulence, the obscene glow of gold. it cows with its complexity and affected air of mystery. 

language is cloak and dagger. it can neither confirm nor deny. it can only represent a state of affairs, possibly true, possibly false. it is the limited hang, the half truth, the sea of misinformation. it is crowd control, a hypnosis of repetition and response.

August

My Love, At Last
----------------

| my love, at last, we're back ashore,
| let's stay here til tomorrow's past.
| we'll lay here still, our sorrows sore,
|    my love, at last.
|
| the world out there is wide and vast,
| horizons left yet to explore, 
| just sit with me, let time go fast. 
|
| if winds are slow, i'll be your oar. 
| when winds are sharp, you'll be my mast.
| so hold me now, just like you swore,
|       oh, my love, at last. 

One Misty Morn
--------------

| One misty morn of summer days
| when clouds collected futures sworn.
| From mountaintops descended haze
|       one misty morn.
| 
| That day a dress of green was worn
| while sky dissolved in liquid grays,
| I took your hand and we were born.
| 
| The sun reclaimed our world with rays,
| dispersed the fog, revealed a thorn.
| The fated prick dispelled the daze
|       one misty morn.

Dinner Wine
-----------

| The dinner wine of nervous dates
| once grew upon a Summer vine.
| The Autumn wind now hushed awaits
|       the dinner wine. 
|
| Beneath the Winter's pure moonshine,
| our words distill like concentrates 
| til fingers find yours under mine. 
|
| A taste of Spring now circulates 
| as starry arcs began decline,
| the final drop that dedicates 
|       the dinner wine.

Little Sprout
-------------

| Oh, little sprout, the forest sleeps
| in arid ground now cursed by drought.
| Across the land, the desert sweeps,
|       oh, little sprout. 
| 
| Your boldness lacks a water spout
| but hidden root in darkness steeps
| the moisture buried deep in doubt. 
|
| The dream of Spring nobody keeps 
| ascends in stems so small and stout 
| when mourning sky beholding weeps,
|       oh, little sprout.

Imaginary Vessels
-----------------

| oh name of names, 
| break me into pieces.
| scatter me across these shores.
| let me linger in the tides,
| in the motion of the waves.
|
| the infinite horizon
| condenses into 
| licks of white foam
| on sparkling beaches.
| 
| shatter me into glass,
| slivered lunar shards.
| cast me into the deep
| to curve like lightning 
| across the geometry of the sea.
| 
| i am a million currents,
| the invisible riptide.
| every moment is an ebb
| within the flowing whole.
|  
| the cruel logic of time
| flows through the 
| phases of the moon.
| let me roar and hiss 
| through lightless nights
| as the tidal ages pass. 
| 
| though my bones are Earth,
| my blood was made from water
| and when my flesh is ground again,
| to the ocean i shall return.
|
| from nothing we are shaped;
| every image is a metaphor
| for the void inside.
| 
| our hearts are imaginary,
| like the shape of water
| that fills every vessel.

Millenial Melodies
------------------

| the slow motion
| lives of trees
| in the forest depths.
| empires of pine
| wage ancient wars
| against city-states of oak.
| an insurgency of maple
| hides in their midst,
| gathering at their trunks,
| the nascent rebellion
| that unwinds over centuries.
|
| morning dew soaks 
| the soft slick bark
| of the frozen sentinels
| and paints with strokes
| measured in years
| the green of pungent
| moldy spores.
|
| here a pile of stones,
| millenia old,
| hewn from a mountain.
| the jagged edges of
| its primordial eruption
| softened by quiet eons,
| now draped with pagan cloaks
| of forest magic,
| the altars of secret
| divinations,
| pooling with the blood
| of moss. 
|
| the harmonic revolutions 
| of parallel life, 
| the millenial melodies
| converging into a chorus
| of now.

The Origin of Lies
------------------

| Oh, Ila, don't be weeping,
|    my dear, you misconstrue;
| The sun is only sleeping
|    before it rises new.
|
| I'll wait with you til morning,
|    and tell you of the stars,
| the memories adorning
|    the empty night with scars. 
|
| This love that's learned by lacking,
|    whose vastness has no chart,
| in silent orbits tracking
|    the shaping of your heart. 
|
| Please trust that nothing passes,
|    we only change our form.
| Your tears transmute to gasses 
|    when sun returns to warm.
|
| Child, listen, though you're growing,
|    some things cannot be known
| until you've grown up knowing
|    out here you're all alone.
|
| I'll be with you forever,
|    these words will be a lie.
| If I could but this deliver:
|    To live until you die.
|
| So while you're small, keep holding
|    my hand as though it soothes,
| The world will keep unfolding
|   each wrinkle that it smoothes.
|
| Believe me when I'm saying:
|    Oh, Ila, darling dear,
| No matter what I'm staying,
|    I'll always be right here. 

Larksong 
--------

| at least the larks remember songs
| each morning rise you're gone again.
| 
| the mourning veils of scattered throngs 
| depart your wake without amen.
| 
| the men who take your parts away
| forget to take my silent heart.
|
| they leave a lily black bouquet
| whose petals fingers tear apart.
| 
| and when i stand alone in pain,
| the stems are bare and nothing's changed. 
| 
| the birds begin their last refrain
| as though they knew and prearranged.
| 
| if nothing else, their voice belongs;
| at least the larks remember songs.

Eulogy
------

| mound of the earth, the funeral pyre,
| sermons of fire, infernos of oak.
|
| burning of briars, spiraling higher,
| chorus expired and softly I spoke:
|
| nothing is left, but cinders remain,
| warm to the touch, as memories fade. 
| 
| look to the thrashing showers of rain,
| mourn with the hissing coils arrayed.
| 
| pound for the taking, body of ash,
| weight of the flame, transmuted to wind. 
| 
| thundering blacks, the cymbals that crash,
| scavenging clouds, vultures descend.
| 
| weep with the water, falling to feet,
| honor your father, drink of his heat.

Windfall
--------

| if every word is written on the wind
| then every sentence grows into a storm. 
| 
| so when you breathed my breath, then gasped and grinned,
| in fronts the future gales began to form.
| 
| and when you spoke, that tempest swelled to swarm,
| converging now to sweep my thoughts away
| 
| right back to where our swirling words perform,
| around our promise howling disarray.
|
| our fate is spelled in thunder struck display,
| in lightning arcs the clouds now ionize. 
| 
| my every breath is filled with yesterday,
| each passing sigh is mixed with our demise.
| 
| the silent rain begins to tell our tale.
| in shallow breaths, your words i still inhale. 

Crystal and Glass
-----------------

| i glue my heart of broken glass.
| refracted rays of you contract
| along the fractures breaks amass. 
|
| we fell in love upon the grass,
| a perfect shattered artifact.
| i glue my heart of broken glass.
|
| the lake was waving evening brass
| reflected in your eyes exact
| along the fractures breaks amass.
| 
| we shared the scent of sassafras
| as water braced for sun's impact.
| i glue my heart of broken glass.
|
| the summer lapped its final pass
| and left the surface still and cracked
| along the fractures breaks amass.
|
| in dreams, these grounds i will trespass
| to find their core, and shards extract.
| i glue my heart of broken glass
| along the fractures breaks amass.

Libations
---------

| this old besotted drink of mine
|    with diamond eyes of ice,
| it burns the throat and smells of pine,
|    this vision steeped in vice.
|
| it lingers sweet as to entice
|    these lips to part for you.
| these nights accrue an awful price
|    that wakes up overdue.
|
| yet lipstick marks on crystal grew
|    as vertigo took hold. 
| we stumbled heedless, flowing through
|    our tongues of amber gold. 
|
| too late, this thirst is uncontrolled;
|     we fell in love once more.
| our words are spilled a hundredfold
|     as once again we swore:
|
| i'll never leave, not anymore,
|     you're all i'll ever need.
| so take a drink, another pour
|     and watch the world recede.
|
| despite the promises agreed
|      the morning tears atone,
| as empty arms of mine proceed
|       to find myself alone.

Snowflake Obsidian
------------------

| a tiny sphere of speckled grey
| once lurked in secret on a shelf
| 
| behind a tarot card display
| when sudden struck, it hurled itself
| 
| from silent birth in cradled heat
| through glowing veins of salted dirt,
| 
| where liquid black condensed complete
| before a bloom distilled a skirt
|
| of flowing fire's grey debris,
| encased in glass it lingers still,
|
| as crashing down its way to me
| it rolled to stop with hidden skill
|
| and waited longer under bed 
| until i gave to you its thread.

The Lives of Kites
------------------

| some years ago there came an errant kite
| from heights unknown, descending breeze with glee.
| 
| in drifting down, it veered off course in flight
| and snagged upon the tallest poplar tree.
|
| despite the frantic pull of frightened wind,
| the kite was lost and stranded far astray.  
|
| each time i passed, its color waned and thinned
| from red to pink, from pink to ghastly gray.
|
| it languished there upon its poplar perch
| until its silk dissolved to drooping thread
|
| and then one day there came a sudden lurch
| as cotton clouds of seed were flung and shed.
|
| the kite's remains reclaimed their place on high
| as slivers shimmered sweetly through the sky.

Ode to Death 
------------

| if i am doomed to die, to fade away,
| then let the Summer dig for me a grave
| so deep beneath her depths of supple clay
| to reach the slate my roots in dying crave
| so seasons pass and cast 
|   my bone to hidden stone
|     through layers moistened brown,
| the loam of ages past
|   from gilded breezes blown
|     that ancient storms brought down.
| 
| in time, my stones will seep through Autumn seams,
| the teeth of grinding Earth that gnash the dead,
| returning flesh to banks of violent streams
| where fallen leaves revive in bloody red 
| remaining veins encased
|   in amber pebble tombs,
|     each waiting turns to die,
| depart this world erased
|   and face the end that looms
|     in dust of covered sky. 
|
| so keep these shards on sheltered shores and guard
| the song of raving larks and restless gaze;
| let nothing chance upon my resting yard
| as sorrow sheds its form, at last, decays;
| i have no edge to skip 
|   but only weight to sink,
|     so rising tides return
| in floods the currents whip
|   to Winter's very brink,
|     my stirring final churn.
|
| and when my ripples flatten back to glass
| remember once again the scent of Spring, 
| perfumed with wasted youth and sassafras,
| regret dissolved to tempest underwing,
| ascending cloudless heights 
|   through heaven's darkest spheres,
|     diluting down to air,
| returning now as lights,
|   this starry nest appears
|     to mark my vast despair.

September 
=========

Ode to the Absent
-----------------

| the Sunday mornings hang in clouds of smoke
| above my head where thoughts of you reside
| recalling times my clumsy fingers broke
| some stitch or knot your fingers deftly tied,
| or when you'd measure out your thread
|    to fix the errors made
|        and sew it back anew,
| i knew when watching as you spread
|    the fiber that i frayed,
|        i never would be you.
|
| what cluttered racks of vinyl rolls to stack
| against the walls where once you puffed your pipe,
| the only imitation i could crack
| now burning in my teeth, a cherry ripe
| as molten metal cast in molds
|    before the water chills
|        and shapes the studs with steam
| to snaps you press through sheets and folds
|    of layered woven twills,
|        to hide the lonely seam.
|
| the intersecting threads of me through strands
| of silken plumes, they needle past my lips
| from dying gears that spin beneath your hands
| and weave the pattern drawn by fingertips
| upon the fabric draping down
|    in wrinkled folds of cloth
|        unrolled in hazy rooms,
| the one you sketched with focused frown
|    and cut to clear the swath
|        of me that burns and fumes.
|
| these empty rooms of tools you left behind,
| as if one day i'd understand their use,
| instead infected specks of rust i grind
| with oiled stones on spinning spokes that loose 
| eroded flakes of showered flames
|    and spray the ground with red,
|        the dust of wasted time,
| each careful pass of sparks reclaims
|    the last remains you shed, 
|        the gleam that hides in grime.
