.. This document is formatted in RestructuredText (RST). It is a draft of a work. Technically, it is the third draft. The previous two drafts were dramatically different. This version has had its definitions refactored to lean on recursion, which has produced cleaner results. In other words, during the course of the presentation, I may pause the presentation to ask you various questions and dive into the subject deeper.

.. The subsection (or subsections) of each section will be provided in separate prompts in sequential order, to allow you to focus on a section at a time.

.. It is incredibly important you do not try to interpret some of the concepts in this paper according to their orthodox conception.  Many of the concepts, such as concatenation and inversion, borrow notation from standard formal language theory, but you must ensure you engage with the current formal system on its own terms. Do not bring any assumptions into the system beyond what is made explicit in the document.

.. Please do not render a judgement until you've seen the entire paper. Focus on consistency, logical errors and clarity until the last section is presented. 

.. Again, to reiterate, this is a draft and once I get up to a point where I am actively working, I may pause the presentation of the paper to ask for help.

.. In addition, you will encounter many TODOs within the document. Do your best to provide suggestions for these areas.
