.. This is a draft of my theory. Technically, it is the third draft. The previous two drafts were dramatically different. This version has had its definitions refactored to lean on recursion, which has produced cleaner results.

.. It is incredibly important you do not try to interpret some of the concepts in this paper according to their orthodox conception.  Many of the concepts, such as concatenation and inversion, borrow notation from standard formal language theory, but you must ensure you engage with the current formal system on its own terms. Do not bring any assumptions into the system beyond what is made explicit in the document. 

.. I am going to present the introduction sections immediately and then go through the work theorem by theorem, definition by definition, etc. 

.. Focus your entire attention on logical consistency and coherence. Identify any errors in proofs or definitions. Go through each deduction or induction step by step and ensure there are no holes or edge cases that are unaccounted for. In short, ensure the system is as consistent as is possible. Rigor is important.
