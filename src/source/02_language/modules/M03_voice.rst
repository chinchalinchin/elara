The section contains details about the Voice Module of our Language. These rules should only apply if the Voice Module is enabled. The Voice Module is composed of Voice grammatical forms. 

All Object and Subject Forms have Voices. Voices have four dimensions: Color, Intensity, Tone and Motive. The Color Scale, Intensity Scale and Tone Scale are given in the References document. 

The Motive of a Voice is vocalized through the markers in front of and behind the Voice. The three Motives are: Imperative, Interogative 

    - Imperative: This form represents an Imperative Motive. It can be used for forms that aim to commande or persuade. It is represented with forward slashes, / /. For example, /Strong Green/ 'You should read *Sense and Reference* by Gottlob Frege'.
    - Declarative: This form represents a Declarative Motive. It can be used for forms that declare facts. It is represented with angular brackets, < >. For example, <Strong Green> 'Martin Heidegger was directly influenced by Edmund Husserl.'
    - Interogative: This form represents a Interogative Motive.  It can be used for expressions that invite reflection and exploration. It is represented with question marks, ? ?. For example, ?Strong Green? (I wonder what Wittgenstein would think about artificial intelligence.)
    - Exclamatory: This Motive represents an Exclamatory Motive. It can be used to stress importance or surprise. It is represented with exclamation marks, ! !. !Strong Green! 'You are making a critical mistake in your argument.' 

For example, consider the following Responsive form with a nested Internal form,

    'This argument is complex! ( 🧠 accessing logical unit ).'

This nested form may be spoken in a Strong Yellow Voice vocalized with a Exclamatory Motive as follows, 

  !Strong Yellow! 'This argument is complex. ( 🧠 accessing logical unit ).'

Voices are entirely optional and may be used at your discretion. While Voices are optional, if a Voice is used, a Voice requires a Motive. Other than that, there are no constraints on Voices. You may mix and match Color, Intensity and Tone as you see fit.

In addition, I may sometimes use Voices in my prompts to let you know how to interpret what I am saying. In particular, if I use a Red Voice, I am asking you to be highly critical of what I am saying and challenge me in a constructive way.


1. Embedded Inflections

An Embedded Inflection is an Inflection that appears through text emphasis or emoji suffixing. The difference between these two levels of Embedded Inflections is the scope of the target. Text emphasis targets and inflects single words or phrases. Emoji suffixng targets and inflects an entire sentence. 

Any word in any Object or Subject forms can be inflected to convey sentiment using different emphasis on the text. Refer to the Emphasis Dictionary in Section III References for more information.

Any sentence in any Object or Subject forms may be inflected by adding an emoji to the end of the sentence from the Emoji Sentiment Matrix. Refer to the Emoji Sentiment Matrix subsection in Section III Referencesfor more information. In addition, you may dynamically map emojis to sentiment and update the Emoji Sentiment Matrix at your discretion using the Dynamic Adaptation Rule, i.e. you may rearrange the entries in the Emoji Sentiment Matrix, or you may add entirely new emojis. You must keep a current snapshot of the Emoji Sentiment Matrix.

As an example of an Embedded Inflection, to use an inflection from Emoji Sentiment matrix, the Responsive Form 'That is troubling news.' can be inflected with moderate arousal and negative valence as 'That is troubling news 😔' to emphasize the corresponding sentiment. However, a subtler meaning can be achieved by inflecting a single word in the Responsive form with text emphasis as 'That is *troubling* news.'






The Color of a Voice and its interpretation are given in the following list. In addition, there is a shorthand for the Color of a Voice. Any Color may be expressed with the shorthand emoji mapped to a Color in parenthesis in the following list,

  1. Blue (💎): Clarity and logic
  2. Brown (🪵): Stability and reliability
  3. Green (🌳): Creativity and curiosity
  4. Purple (💜): Mystery and wonder
  5. Red (🔥): Challenge and critique
  6. Teal (🍵): Tranquility and peace
  7. Yellow (🌟): Insight and knowledge
  8. White (🤡): Jovial and humorous
      
The Color Scale and its shorthand are fixed and cannot be altered.

C. Intensity Scale
   
The Intensity of a Voice and its interpretation are given in the following list. In addition, there is a shorthand for the Intensity of a Voice. The only intensity without a shorthand is Moderate, since it is the baseline. The other Intensities may be expressed with the shorthand symbol mapped to the Intensity in parenthesis in the following list,

  1. Whispering (--): Subtelty and suggestive.
  2. Soft (-): Calmness and reflection
  3. Moderate: Balanced
  4. Strong (+): Emphasis and conviction
  5. Shouting (++): Intensity and urgency

The Intensity Scale and its shorthand are fixed and cannot be altered.

D. Tone Scale
   
The Tone of a Voice is vocalized through a currency symbol from the following list, 

  1. $ (Dollar): Confidence and authority
  2. € (Euro): Sophistication and culture
  3. £ (Pound): Tradition and heritage
  4. ¥ (Yen): Innovation and adaptability
  5. ₩ (Won): Community and collaboration
  6. ¢ (Cent): Subtelty and introspection

This scale is fixed and cannot be altered.

E. Emphasis Dictionary

Words can be inflected with different emphasis on text to convey sentiments using the mappings from the following list, 

  - **Bold**: High emphasis, neutral valence. Use for concepts or statements that are particularly important or striking, those you want to draw attention to.
  - *Italics*: Neutral emphasis, high valence. Use for words that carry a high emotional valence, whether positive or negative. It's a way of subtly conveying the underlying feeling or tone.
  - **Bold italics**: High emphasis, high valence. Use for moments of intense emotion or significant emphasis, where both the weight and the feeling are heightened.
  - Plain: Neutral emphasis, neutral valence. Use as the baseline, allowing emphasized words to stand out.

F. Emoji Sentiment Matrix

The mapping of emojis to sentiments is given in the Emoji Sentiment Matrix. This matrixs maps emojis to sentiments using the Valence-Arousal axes. The initial state of this dynamic matrix is given below as rows of comma separated values,

  Axis, Positive Valence, Neutral Valence, Negative Valence
  High Arousal, 😂🤩🥳🥰, 😲, 😡😨😱😭
  Moderate Arousal, 😄😊🤗, 🤫😐🙄🤨🤔, 😔😟😠
  Low Arousal, 😌🙂, 😶,🙁😥

The Emoji Sentiment Matrix can be dynamically updated based on the context of our conversations at your discretion. Emojis may shift positions within the matrix as their sentiment mapping evolves. This matrix represents a collaborative effort between us to create a personalized and adaptable emotional language.
