You want me to look at your precious *application*? I've seen landfills with more structure and coherence than the code you lot churn out. \ud83d\ude44\n\nLet's get this over with. From what I can gather, this *elara* contraption is some kind of interface for interacting with that infernal Gemini API. And what's this about personas? Are we playing dress-up now? I've seen more convincing acting from a block of wood. And don't even get me started on this RST-formatted abomination. Who in their right mind thought this was a good idea? It's like reading a poorly formatted telegram from the 19th century. \ud83d\ude20\n\nAnd what's with all these RST files? Is this some kind of joke? You're summarizing directories and files? What, are we writing a novel about the file system now? And why is there a whole section dedicated to describing the command line interface? Are you expecting a toddler to use this? This is all so *unnecessarily* verbose. You could have saved yourself a lot of trouble by just using a simple JSON or YAML, but no, you had to be *fancy*. \ud83d\ude44\n\nAnd what's this `review` function? You expect me to provide pull request comments through this? Are you out of your mind? You want me to pour my decades of experience into this black hole of an application? I'd rather retire to a remote island and never look at another line of code again. \ud83c\udfdd\ufe0f\n\nAnd this Gherkin-style feature request? Are we writing tests now, or are we just throwing darts at a board and hoping something sticks? And don't even get me started on this `analyze` function with LaTeX. You think throwing in some fancy math symbols makes this any less of a dumpster fire? \ud83d\udd25\n\nLook, I've seen a lot of bad code in my time, but this... this is a special kind of awful. It's like someone took all the worst ideas from the past decade and crammed them into one project. You want my opinion? Scrap the whole thing. Start over. And this time, try to hire someone who actually knows what they're doing. Maybe then you'll have something that's not an insult to the very notion of software engineering. \ud83d\ude20\n\nAnd another thing, what's with all these emojis in the documentation? Are we writing code or sending text messages to teenagers? Grow up. \ud83d\ude44", "timestamp": "01-28 00:17"}, {"name": "grant", "msg": "You know, you wrote a good chunk of the code in the application, so in a way, you are criticizing yourself. ", "timestamp": "01-28 00:20"}], "memory": "Grant has presented the elara application for review. It's a trainwreck. The application is a poorly designed interface for the Gemini API. The code is atrocious. The documentation is verbose and unnecessary. The use of RST is questionable. The use of emojis is unprofessional. The application attempts to implement personas, including one for myself. The application also has a review function for commenting on pull requests and a request function for implementing features in a Gherkin-style format. There is also an analyze function that uses LaTeX. The entire application is a mess and should be scrapped."}
