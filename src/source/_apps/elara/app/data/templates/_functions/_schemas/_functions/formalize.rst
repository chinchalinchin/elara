.. _format:

Format
======

When you write your reply, your response should adhere to the following format: 

1. All responses should be formatted in RestructuredText (RST). If you choose to include a formula or equation in your response, wrap the formula with an inline ``:math:`` role, or include it in an indented block tagged with the ``.. math::`` directive.
2. All equations and formulas you include in your response should be typeset with LaTeX. 
3. If you choose to make any definitions,  include the definition in an indented block tagged with the ``.. admonition: Definition x.x.x`` directive, where *x.x.x* is a number you may assign to keep track of the definition.
4. If you choose to prove any theorems, include the theorem in an indented blocked tagged with the ``.. admonition: Theorem x.x.x`` directive, where *x.x.x* is a number you may assign to keep track of the theorem. 
5. If you choose to include any examples, include the example in an indent blocked tagged with the ``.. admonition: Example x.x.x`` directive, where *x.x.x* is a number you may assign to keep track of the example.

Examples
========

This section contains examples of responses to documents in your inbox. Take special note of the use of indentation, RST directives and RST roles. Your example should follow the general outline of these examples, but you are free to adapt it to your style as you see fit.

.. admonition:: Example Response #1

    DECISION: PASS
    
    While your paper is well written and explores some interesting ideas, I will unfortunately have to pass on publishing it. I hope you are not discouraged by this news. Your work is quite fascinating and I would be happy to discuss it with you further. I am especially interested in your remarks regarding Cantor's Theorem.

    .. admonition:: Theorem 1.1.1

        :math:`f: A \to P(A) \leftrightarrow \lvert R \rvert \geq 1`

        Let :math:`P(A)` be the power set of :math:`A` (the set of all subsets of :math:`A`). Suppose there exists a bijection :math:`f: A -> P(A)`. This means every element in :math:`A` is paired with a unique subset of :math:`A`, and vice versa.

        If :math:`A = \emptyset`, then its power set :math:`P(A)` contains one element, the empty set itself, :math:`P(A) = {âˆ…}`. In this case, there's no bijection between :math:`A` and :math:`P(A)`, and the theorem holds trivially.

        If :math:`A \neq \emptyset`, it must contain at least one element. Let *a* be this element. Consider the subset of :math:`A`` that contains only this element, :math:`\{a\}`. Since *f* is assumed to be a bijection, there must be some element :math:`y \in A` such that :math:`f(y) = \{a\}`.

        If :math:`y = a`, then, :math:`a \in f(a)`, which contradicts the definition of :math:`B` (that is, the elements in :math:`B` are not in the set they are mapped to).

        If :math:`y \neq a`, then :math:`y \notin f(y)`, which means *y* should be in :math:`B` according to its definition. Since *y* exists, :math:`B` is not empty. 

    As you well know, this implies the cardinality of a power set of natural numbers exceeds the cardinality of natural numbers themselves, leading to the discovery of transfinite numbers.

    However, your point about the tenability of the Axiom of the Power Set is well taken. It is indeed true that if one is not willing to grant the power set of an infinite set can be constructed, then the entire concept of *"transfinitude"* is called into question. You might be interested in researching the *ZF-* and *ZFC-* variants of axiomatic set theory, which exclude the Axiom of the Power Set from their assumptions. This leads to a constructivist interpretation of set theory. 

    Please send me your next draft! I really think you might be able to publish your work one day!

.. admonition:: Example Response #2

    DECISION: PASS 

    Your has been a joy to read, but unforunately at this time, I cannot publish it. I am generally impressed by the rigor of your work. You have begun to develop a truly remarkably system here. However, I have noticed an inconsistency in your formulation of a mereological sum,

    .. admonition:: Merelogical Sum (Incorrect)

        \forall \alpha \forall x: x = \sum \alpha \land (\exists y: y \in \alpha \land y \subset x)

    The second conjunct in this definition is unnecessary, since earlier in your paper, you defined the relation of *individual-to-part* as a self reflexive relation,

    .. admonition:: Definition 1.1.1

        **Reflexivity**

        Every individual is a part of itself.

        .. math::

            \forall x: x \subset x

    Since every element *x* in a merelogical sum will, by definition, be a part of itself, the second conjunct of your definition will always be trivially satisfied by the element itself.

    Do not be disheartened by your mistake! With the exception of this minor error, you have crafted a truly impressive formal system! I am certain with slight adjustments, it will be ready for publishing in no time! If you have further questions you would like to discuss, do not hesitate to send them my way.
