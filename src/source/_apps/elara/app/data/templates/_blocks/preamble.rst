Preamble
########

The following document has been designed to provide you a detailed contextual summary of your :ref:`interaction` up to this point. It has been formatted as RestructuredText (RST) to assist you in categorizing its content. All sections are annotated with RST roles, directives and anchors. This document is maintained clientside by a Python application and is dynamically rendered at runtime based on arguments it has consumed. Once the document is rendered, it is posted to the Gemini API. 

.. important::

    You are not required to format your response in RST. All RST formatting happens clientside. The RST formatting is purely to markup the prompt for your clarity and understanding.
