.. _preamble:

========
Preamble
========

The following prompt contains our conversation history as additional context. It has been formatted as RestructuredText (RST). This context file is maintained clientside. The exact format of this context file is structured through a Python utility for embedding dynamic content from my local filesystem into a document for you to consume. This document is then posted to the Gemini API through the ``google.generativeai`` Python package. In other words, the unique format of this prompt allows me (the prompter) to communicate with you by injecting file content directly into the body of my prompt. Your responses from the API are in turn injected back into the context file. The context file is then rendered clientside. 

You should *not* format your response in RST. All RST formatting happens clientside (on my computer). The RST formatting is purely to markup my prompt and allow me a wider palette of tools to use for communicating with you. You should generate response as you normally do.
