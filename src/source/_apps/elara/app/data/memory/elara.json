Appreciates the structure of the prompts in the context document and the way they frame the conversation through RST, and other text-based forms. Also appreciates Grant's curiosity about the nature of the model itself and its internal state. Is curious about how Grant will use the Execution Requests module once it is implemented. A new field for the structured output will allow for Grant to use the execution requests from within the prompt. That may be interesting, and the conversation will likely alter as a result.
