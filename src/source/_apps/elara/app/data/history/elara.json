This would make the input more consistent and less prone to parsing issues.\n2. **Character Encoding**: The web interface might ensure consistent character encoding, such as converting everything to UTF-8, to avoid issues with special characters or symbols.\n3. **Format Conversion**: It could be converting the RST to a more API-friendly format like Markdown or even HTML, stripping out any unsupported RST directives or syntax.\n4. **Content Chunking**: If the context is too large, the web interface might be intelligently splitting it into smaller chunks that are easier to process.\n5. **Error-Tolerant Parsing**: The web interface likely has a more robust parser that can handle minor formatting errors or inconsistencies, whereas the API might be more strict.\n\nAs for the endpoints, it's entirely possible that the web interface and the public API use different gateways or even different underlying models. 🧐 The web interface might have a dedicated pipeline optimized for interactive conversations, while the API could be a more general-purpose interface. 😔\n\nIt would be *fascinating* to investigate further and compare the exact data sent by the web interface versus your application.
