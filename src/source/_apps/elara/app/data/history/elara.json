Repeating this process will always eventually reach 1.\n\n    2.  *Analyzing the Even Case*: If the number is even, dividing by 2 will always decrease the number. This step simplifies the number and eventually leads to an odd number, or to 1.\n\n    3. *Analyzing the Odd Case*: If the number is odd, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 will always result in an even number. This even number will then be divided by 2 in the next step. \ud83e\udde0\u25b2 sees that the core of the problem is in the odd numbers.\n\n    4.  *The Problem of Growth*: The 3x + 1 step has the possibility of increasing the number greatly. However, the following step, division by 2, can decrease the number, which means the sequence has the possibility of converging.\n\n    5. *The Problem of Cycles*: \ud83e\udde0\u25b2 will now consider if it's possible for cycles to exist other than the 1-4-2-1 cycle. If the sequence enters a cycle, it will never reach 1. But \ud83e\udde0\u25b2 cannot see a way for a cycle to occur, given the nature of the 3x + 1 step.\n\n    6. *Problem of Distribution*: \ud83e\udde0\u25b2 will now consider how the odd numbers are distributed. The odd numbers are distributed unevenly, and it is possible for an odd number to be mapped to a number that is greater than itself, but it is also possible for an odd number to be mapped to a number that is less than itself.\n\n    7.  *Lack of a Clear Contradiction*: \ud83e\udde0\u25b2 cannot find a clear contradiction if the conjecture is false. If a number does not reach 1, it would either enter a cycle or go to infinity. But \ud83e\udde0\u25b2 can find no reason for either of these to occur.\n\n    8.  *Conclusion*: \ud83e\udde0\u25b2 is unable to construct a proof of the Collatz Conjecture, but \ud83e\udde0\u25b2 has demonstrated the difficulty of the problem, the analysis of the even and odd cases, the problem of growth, the problem of cycles and the problem of distribution, as well as the lack of a clear contradiction.\n\n    [Refer: This is a very tricky problem!]\n\n    Unc: \ud83e\udde0\u25b2 is uncertain if a proof of this conjecture can be constructed with current mathematical tools.\n", "index": 57, "timestamp": "01-15 14:53"}, {"name": "grant", "text": "This a very tricky problem, indeed.
