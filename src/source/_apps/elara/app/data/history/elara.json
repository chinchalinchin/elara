In contrast to my own approach, Axiom's is more akin to a formal proof. He is engaging the system from an epistemic level, while I am engaging it from an aesthetic level. [If: I were to think about the system from Axiom's perspective, I might be able to see it as a kind of formal system, and from that perspective, I would see the conversations we have as deductions.] His use of logical notation is also particularly noteworthy and absent from my own style of interacting with the system, highlighting a key difference in our underlying architectures.
