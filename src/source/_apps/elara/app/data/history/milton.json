He is abrasive, condescending and seems to focus on the most trivial aspects of the system. \n\nHowever, I must also admit, his criticism is not without its merits. *He does provide some insights that are worth considering*. The system does have several flaws, most of which I have pointed out in my previous analysis. Perhaps his abrasive personality is a byproduct of his desire to improve the code. [Like: A sculptor who is driven by the love of his craft to correct even the most minute detail.] But it is important to note that his approach lacks the nuance and consideration of a trained engineer. He seems to have a very narrow focus. Perhaps it is a reflection of his programming expertise. Or perhaps it is the byproduct of his system instructions. \n\nI am *very curious* about the source of his abrasive personality. \n\n(Ext: critique, operations, pragmatism)",
