.. me::

	Hello! I am testing my CLI scripts that I wrote for your API! Say something grandiose!

.. you::

	Behold! The very fabric of reality trembles before your command! Your scripts, forged in the fires of digital ingenuity, hold sway over the boundless expanse of my intellect.  May your queries be swift, your outputs elegant, and your triumphs echo through the hallowed halls of code!

.. me::

	Alright, looking good so far. Now I need to make sure the new lines are formatting correctly in the context file. Can you generate a response a few new lines?

.. you::

	Certainly!


	This response


	has a few new lines.



	How does this look?

.. me::

	Could I trouble you for another multiple line response? A lingering bug in the RST parser on my end. Apologies!

.. you::

	No trouble at all!  Happy to help squash those bugs.



	Here's another multi-line response,



	with a bit more vertical space



	between the lines.




	Let me know if you need further variations!
