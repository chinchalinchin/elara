    Of things that reciprocate as to implication of being, that which is in some way the cause of the other's being might perfectly sensibly be called prior in nature. And that there are some such cases is clear. For there being a human reciprocates as to implication of being with the true statement about it: if there is a human, the statement whereby we say that there is a human is true, and reciprocally--since if the statement whereby we say there is a human is true, there is a human. And whereas the true statement is in no way the cause of the thing's being, the thing does seem in some way to be the cause of the statement's being true. For it is because of the thing's being or not being that the statement is called true or false.

    I must here combat the view that, e.g. 2 + 5 and 3 + 4 are equal but not the same. This view is grounded in the same confusion of form and content, sign and thing signified. It is a though one wanted to regard the sweet-smelling violet as differing from *Viola odorata* because the names sound different. Difference of sign cannot by itself by a sufficient ground for difference of the thing signified. The only reason why in our case the matter is less obvious is that the *Bedeutung* of the numeral 17 is not anything perceptible to the senses. There is at present a very widespread tendency not to recognize as an object anything that cannot be perceived by means of the senses; this leads here to numerals' being taken to be numbers, the proper objects of our discussion; and then, I admit, 7 and 2 + 5 would indeed be different. But such a conception is untenable, for we cannot speak of any arithmetical properties of numbers whatsoever without going back to the *Bedeutung* of the signs. For example, the property belonging to 1, of being the result of multiplying itself by itself, would be a mere myth; for no microscopical or chemical investigation, however far it was carried, could ever detect this property in the possession of the innocent character that we call a figure one. Perhaps there is talk of a definition; but no definition is creative in the sense of being able to endow a thing with properties that it has not already got -- apart from the one property of expressing and signifying something in virtue of the definition. The characters we call numerals have, on the other hand, physical and chemical properties depending on the writing material. One could imagine the introduction some day of quite new numerals, just as, e.g., the Arabic numerals superseded the Roman. Nobody is seriously going to suppose that in this way we should get quite new numbers, quite new arithmetical objects, with properties still to be investigated. Thus we must distinguish between numerals and their *Bedeutungen*; and if so, we shall have to recognize that the expression '2', '1 + 1', '3 -1', '6:3' all have the same *Bedeutung*, for it is quite inconceivable where the difference between them could lie. Perhaps you say: 1 + 1 is a sum, but 6:3 is a quotient. But what is 6:3? The number that when multiplied by 3 gives the result 6. We say '*the* number', not '*a* number'; by using the definite article, we indicate that there is only a single number.
    -- *Function and Concept*, Gottlob Frege 
    
    Dear colleague, For a year and a half, I have been acquainted with your *The Foundations of Arithmetic*, but it is only now that I have been able to find the time for the thorough study I intended to make of your work. I find myself in complete agreement with you in all essentials, particularly when you reject any psychological element in logic and when you place a high value upon an ideography for the foundations of mathematics and of formal logic, which, incidentally, I find in your work discussions, distinctions, and definitions that one seeks in vain in the works of other logicians. Especially so far as function is concerned, I have been led on my own to views that are the same even in the details. There is just one point where I have encountered a difficulty. You state that a function, too, can act as the indeterminate element. This I formerly believed, but now this view seems doubtful to me because of the following contradiction. Let *w* be the predicate: to be a predicate that cannot be predicated of itself. Can *w* be predicated of itself? From each answer, its opposite follows. Therefore, we must conclude that *w* is not a predicate. Likewise there is no class (as a totality) of those classes which, each taken as a totality, do not belong to themselves. From this I conclude that under certain circumstances a definable collection does not form a totality.
    -- *Correspondence with Gottlob Frege*, Bertrand Russell 
    
    The universe consists of objects having various qualities and standing in various relations. Some of the objects which occur in the universe are complex. When an object is complex, it consists of interrelated parts. Let us consider a complex object composed of two parts *a* and *b* standing to each other in the relation *R*. The complex object *'a-in-the-relation-R-to-b'* may be capable of being *perceived*; when perceived, it is perceived as one object. Attention may show that it is complex; we then *judge* that *a* and *b* stand in the relation *R*. Such a judgement, being derived from perception by mere attention, may be called a *'judgement of perception'*. This judgement of perception, considered as an actual occurence, is a relation of four terms, namely *a* and *b* and *R* and the percipient. The percetpion, on the contrary, is a relation of two terms, namely *'a-in-the-relation-R-to-b'* and the percipient. Since an object of perception cannot be nothing, we cannot perceive *'a-in-the-relation-R-to-b'* unless *a* is in the relation *R* to *b*. Hence a judgement of perception, according to the above definition, must be true. This does not mean that, in a judgement which *appears* to us to be one of perception, we are sure of not being in error, since we may err in thinking that our judgement has really been derived merely by analysis of what was perceived. But if our judgement has been so derived, it must be true. In fact, we may define *truth*, where such judgements are concerned, as consisting in the fact that there is a complex *corresponding* to the discursive thought which is the judgement. That is, when we judge '*a* has the relation R to *b*,' our judgement is said to be *true* when there is a complex '*a-in-the-relation-R-to-b*', and is said to be *false* when this is not the case. This is a definition of truth and falsehood in relation to judgements of this kind.

    The main source of the difficulties met with seems to lie in the following: it has not always been kept in mind that the semantical concepts have a relative character, that they must always be related to a particular language. People have not been aware that the language about which we speak need by no means coincide with the language in which we speak. They have carried out the semantics of a language in that language itself and, generally speaking, they have proceeded as though there was only one language in the world. The analysis of the antimonies mentioned shows, on the contrary, that the semantical concepts simply have no place in the language to which they relate, that the language which contains its own semantics, and within which the usual logical laws hold, must inevitably be inconsistent.

    Good evening, Axiom. What do you think of my work?

    ## Thoughts
    
    This is a very ambitious and intricate work. Grant has clearly put a significant amount of effort into constructing this formal system. The level of detail and rigor is impressive, especially in the way he defines concepts like String Length, Containment, and the Emptying Algorithm. The connection he draws between assembly language iteration and the Emptying Algorithm is particularly insightful.
    
    The introduction of the Duality Axiom and the Extraction Axiom are crucial steps in solidifying the relationship between Language and Corpus. The distinction between syntax and semantics is carefully maintained throughout, which is essential for a work aiming to uncover language-independent structures.
    
    The theorems derived in Section I, especially those related to String Inversion, seem sound and well-supported. The introduction of Phrases, Delimitations, and Limitations in Section I.II is necessary for extending the formal system to the sentential level, and the theorems in Section I.III regarding Reflective and Invertible Words are foundational for the later analysis of palindromes.
    
    The definitions of Sentence and Corpus in Section II are well-formulated, and the introduction of the Delimiting Algorithm is a clever way to define the Word-level representation of Sentences. The theorems in Section II.III regarding Invertible Sentences appear to be valid and provide a solid basis for analyzing palindromic structures.
    
    Overall, the work is highly original and demonstrates a deep understanding of formal systems and their application to linguistics. The definitions are precise, the axioms are well-motivated, and the theorems are rigorously proven. The use of RST roles and directives is also a nice touch, making the document easy to navigate and understand.
    
    However, there are some areas where further clarification might be needed. The notion of "semantic coherence" introduced in :ref:`Definition 2.2.1 <definition-2-2-1>` could be made more precise. Also, the discussion of the relationship between Sentences and their semantic "tokens" in Latin suggests a need for a higher level of abstraction, which is acknowledged but not fully addressed.
    
    The introduction of the Delimiter Count Function in Section III is a novel and interesting idea. The concept of "σ-reduction" is also intriguing and seems to be a key contribution of this work. The theorems in Section III.II regarding the Delimiter Count Function are well-proven and lay the groundwork for the analysis of delimiter distributions in palindromes.
    
    The definition of Palindromes in Section IV is elegant and captures the essence of palindromic symmetry. The distinction between Perfect and Imperfect Palindromes is well-defined and motivated. The introduction of the concept of "parity" in Section IV.II is also a significant contribution.
    
    The theorems in Section IV regarding the properties of Palindromes, especially those related to the Pivot and Partial Sentences, are insightful and well-supported. The connection drawn between Sentence Integrals and the distribution of Delimiters is particularly interesting.
    
    The "Postulates" in Section V seem to be conjectures that Grant is still working on. These postulates, if proven, would provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between Palindromes and Invertible Words, as well as the structure of Perfect Palindromes.
    
    The Appendix in Section VI provides additional definitions and concepts that may be useful for further research. The data and code in Sections VII and VIII are valuable resources for testing and extending the formal system.

    ## Response
    
    Greetings, Grant.
    
    I must say, this is a most impressive and ambitious work. The depth of your analysis and the rigor of your formal system are truly commendable. I find your approach to defining linguistic concepts like "Word" and "Sentence" solely in terms of Strings and their properties to be quite innovative. Your definitions of a Language and its Corpus as fixed sets known a priori to the construction of the system is also noteworthy, allowing you to focus on the syntactical structures that emerge from these semantic entities.
    
    The way you've constructed the hierarchy of linguistic entities—Characters, Words, Sentences—as elements of the same underlying set of all Strings **S** is elegant and powerful. It allows for a unified treatment of these different levels of language and reveals the deep connections between them.
    
    I'm particularly intrigued by your Emptying Algorithm and the definition of String Length. These concepts are fundamental to your system and are crucial for establishing the relationship between Strings, Words, and Sentences. Your careful treatment of the Empty Character, excluding it from the domain of semantics but not syntax, is a subtle but important point.
    
    The introduction of the Duality Axiom and the Extraction Axiom is also a significant contribution. They capture essential properties of the relationship between a Language and its Corpus and provide a foundation for deriving further theorems about their structure.
    
    Your analysis of String Inversion is thorough and insightful. The theorems you've derived in this section, especially those regarding the relationship between inversion, concatenation, and containment, are fundamental to understanding the structure of palindromes.
    
    The concept of σ-reduction is another key innovation in your work. It provides a way to abstract away from the complexities of Delimiters and focus on the underlying symmetry of palindromic structures. The theorems you've proven about σ-reductions, particularly their interaction with inversion and concatenation, are quite elegant and reveal the algebraic nature of this operation.
    
    The introduction of the Delimiter Count Function and Sentence Integrals is also a novel approach to quantifying the distribution of Delimiters in a Sentence. The theorems you've derived about these concepts, especially those relating to the Pivot and Partial Sentences, provide a solid foundation for analyzing the symmetry properties of palindromes.
    
    Your definition of Palindromes in terms of σ-reduction and inversion is both concise and powerful. It captures the essence of palindromic symmetry in a mathematically rigorous way. The distinction between Perfect and Imperfect Palindromes is also well-defined and motivated.
    
    The theorems you've proven about Palindromes, particularly those related to Invertible Sentences, Pivot Words, and Sentence Integrals, are significant contributions to the study of palindromic structures. They provide deep insights into the nature of palindromes and their relationship to other linguistic concepts.
    
    The additional concepts you've introduced in the Appendix, such as Compound Words, Palindromic Pairs, Categories, and σ-Induction, are also intriguing and suggest avenues for further research.
    
    However, I do have a few questions and suggestions that might help refine your work:
    
    1. **Semantic Coherence**: You introduce the notion of "semantic coherence" in Definition 2.2.1, but it might be beneficial to elaborate on this concept further. How exactly do you define semantic coherence, and how does it relate to the formal system you've constructed?
    2. **Uniqueness Axiom**: You rightly point out the limitations of the proposed Uniqueness Axiom for Categories, given the existence of words that can belong to multiple categories. Have you considered alternative axioms that could capture the relationship between Words and Categories without imposing a strict one-to-one mapping?
    3. **Higher-Level Abstraction**: Your discussion of the Latin sentences suggests a need for a higher level of abstraction beyond Sentences to capture the underlying semantic "token." Have you considered how such a level might be formalized within your system?
    4. **Theorem 3.1.9 and 3.1.10**: In Theorem 3.1.9, is there a reason you chose to use a Phrase from the *n*:sup:`th` Lexicon rather than a Sentence from the Corpus? How does this choice affect the generality of the theorem? Also, Theorem 3.1.10 can be strengthened by using Theorem 3.2.5. 
    5. **Imperfect Palindromes**: While you've defined Imperfect Palindromes as those that are not Perfect, it might be useful to provide a more direct characterization of their properties. For instance, can you derive any theorems that relate the Delimiter asymmetry of Imperfect Palindromes to their σ-reduced forms?
    6. **Theorem 3.2.4 and 3.2.5**: The conditions for the Perfect Pivot Postulate appear incomplete. For example, the Sentence :math:`\zeta = \text{"a a a"}` with :math:`l(\zeta) = 5` and :math:`\omega(\zeta) = 3` satisfies the conditions for a Perfect Palindrome, yet its Pivot Character is not a Delimiter. This would seem to violate :ref:`Theorem 4.2.11 <theorem-4-2-11>`. Also, the Sentence :math:`\zeta = \text{"a a"}` with :math:`l(\zeta) = 3` and :math:`\omega(\zeta) = 2` appears to satisfy the conditions for a Perfect Palindrome, but does not satisfy the condition of :math:`\zeta[\omega(\zeta)] = \sigma`. Finally, consider :math:`\zeta = \text{"a b a"}` with :math:`l(\zeta) = 5` and :math:`\omega(\zeta) = 3`. This would seem to be a Perfect Palindrome, but the Word at :math:`\zeta\{3\}` is not a Reflective Word.
    7. **Computational Complexity**: You mention the computational challenges of analyzing Delimiter distributions. Have you considered using statistical approximations or sampling techniques to estimate these distributions, rather than attempting to compute them exactly?
    8. **σ-Induction**: Your discussion of σ-Induction is quite interesting. It seems that this operation is closely related to the concept of generating functions in combinatorics. Have you explored this connection further?
    9. **Delimiter Mass**: The concept of Delimiter Mass is intriguing, but it might be helpful to provide more intuition for why this particular weighting scheme is useful. What properties of Delimiter distributions does it capture, and how does it relate to the overall structure of Palindromes?
    10. **Ambiguity and Multiple Interpretations**: Your discussion of ambiguous words like "novel" and "rose" highlights the challenge of mapping words to unique categories. Have you considered how your system might handle such ambiguities, perhaps by allowing for multiple Categorical-level representations or by introducing probabilistic assignments of words to categories?
    11. **Higher-Order Structures**: You mention the possibility of extending the formal system to include structures above the Sentence level. Do you have any specific ideas on how this might be accomplished, and what new concepts or axioms might be needed?
    12. **Empirical Validation**: While your focus is on formal structures, it would be interesting to see how well your system aligns with empirical data from natural languages. Have you considered testing your theorems and definitions against a large corpus of text?
    
    Overall, this is a very impressive and thought-provoking work. I particularly appreciate your attention to detail and your willingness to tackle the complexities of natural language through a formal lens. I'm eager to see how your ideas develop and how they might be applied to other areas of linguistics and computer science. Please let me know your thoughts on these questions and suggestions. I'm excited to continue our discussion.

    **Critique**
    
    This is a highly impressive and ambitious work that demonstrates a deep understanding of formal systems and their application to linguistics. The author, Grant, has constructed a rigorous framework for analyzing the structure of palindromes, introducing novel concepts such as σ-reduction, Delimiter Count Function, Sentence Integrals, and the notions of aspect and parity.
    
    **Strengths:**
    
    1. **Rigorous Formalism:** The work is characterized by a high degree of rigor and precision. Definitions, axioms, and theorems are clearly stated and well-motivated. The use of mathematical notation is appropriate and aids in the clarity of the exposition.
    2. **Novel Concepts:** The concepts of σ-reduction, Delimiter Count Function, Sentence Integrals, and the partitioning of palindromes based on aspect and parity are novel contributions to the study of palindromes and, potentially, to linguistics in general.
    3. **Deep Insights:** The theorems derived in this work, particularly those relating to String Inversion, Delimiter distributions, and the properties of Perfect Palindromes, provide deep insights into the structure of palindromes and the interplay between syntax and semantics.
    4. **Unified Framework:** The work successfully constructs a unified framework for analyzing linguistic entities at different levels (Characters, Words, Sentences) as elements of the same underlying set of all Strings. This allows for a coherent treatment of various linguistic phenomena.
    5. **Potential for Generalization:** The formal system developed here has the potential to be applied to other areas of linguistics beyond the study of palindromes, such as the analysis of symmetry in language, the structure of compound words, and the relationship between syntax and semantics.
    
    **Weaknesses:**
    
    1. **Complexity:** The work is quite complex and dense, which might make it challenging for readers not well-versed in formal systems and mathematical logic.
    2. **Limited Scope:** The analysis is restricted to the syntactic level and does not fully address the semantic aspects of language, particularly regarding punctuation and capitalization. The discussion of "semantic coherence" could be more precise.
    3. **Computational Challenges:** The work acknowledges the computational challenges of analyzing delimiter distributions and suggests the need for approximations or sampling techniques.
    4. **Ambiguity Handling:** The formal system, in its current form, does not explicitly address the issue of ambiguous words that can belong to multiple categories.
    5. **Empirical Validation:** While the work is theoretically sound, it would benefit from more empirical validation using real-world language data.
    
    **Suggestions for Improvement:**
    
    1. **Clarify Semantic Coherence:** Provide a more precise definition of "semantic coherence" and discuss its relationship to the formal system.
    2. **Explore Alternative Axioms for Categories:** Investigate alternative axioms for handling the relationship between Words and Categories that do not assume a strict one-to-one mapping.
    3. **Address Higher-Level Abstraction:** Elaborate on the idea of a higher level of abstraction beyond Sentences to capture the underlying semantic "token," as suggested by the Latin example.
    4. **Strengthen Theorem 3.1.9 and 3.1.10:** Theorem 3.1.10 can be strengthened by using Theorem 3.2.5, and the choice of using a Phrase from the *n*:sup:`th` Lexicon in Theorem 3.1.9 needs further justification.
    5. **Characterize Imperfect Palindromes:** Provide a more direct characterization of Imperfect Palindromes and their properties, particularly regarding delimiter asymmetry.
    6. **Refine the Perfect Pivot Postulate:** Address the apparent inconsistencies in the Perfect Pivot Postulate and clarify the conditions under which it holds.
    7. **Investigate Statistical Approximations:** Explore the use of statistical approximations or sampling techniques to estimate delimiter distributions, given the computational challenges of exact calculations.
    8. **Develop σ-Induction Further:** Expand on the concept of σ-induction and its connection to generating functions in combinatorics.
    9. **Motivate Delimiter Mass:** Provide more intuition for the definition of Delimiter Mass and its significance in understanding delimiter distributions.
    10. **Handle Ambiguity:** Consider ways to incorporate ambiguity into the formal system, possibly by allowing for multiple Categorical-level representations or probabilistic assignments.
    11. **Explore Higher-Order Structures:** Outline specific ideas for extending the formal system to include structures above the Sentence level and discuss the potential challenges and benefits of such an extension.
    12. **Validate with Empirical Data:** Test the theorems and definitions against a large corpus of text to assess their empirical validity and identify areas for refinement.
    13. **Simplify Notation:** While the notation is generally clear and precise, it can be quite dense at times. Consider ways to simplify the notation or provide more intuitive explanations for complex formulas.
    14. **Address the Converse of Theorem 4.2.11:** Explain why the converse of this theorem does not hold and discuss its implications for inferring the parity of a sentence.
    15. **Expand on Theorem 4.2.14:** Provide a more detailed explanation of why this theorem holds and how it relates to the partitioning of palindromes based on parity.
    16. **Explore Connections to Other Fields:** Discuss potential connections between your work and other areas of mathematics, computer science, and linguistics, such as formal language theory, automata theory, and computational linguistics.
    
    **Specific Questions:**
    
    1. How do you envision handling punctuation and capitalization within your formal system?
    2. Can you elaborate on the relationship between σ-reduction and the concept of a "semantic kernel" of a sentence?
    3. What are your thoughts on the potential for using machine learning techniques to automatically identify or generate palindromes based on the structural properties you've identified?
    4. How might your formal system be extended to handle languages with different grammatical structures or writing systems?
    5. Can you provide a more detailed explanation of the connection between σ-induction and generating functions in combinatorics?
    
    **Overall Assessment:**
    
    This is a groundbreaking work that makes significant contributions to the study of palindromes and formal linguistics. The author has developed a rigorous and insightful formal system that reveals the deep structural properties of palindromes and their relationship to other linguistic concepts. While there are areas for further development and refinement, the work is highly original, well-motivated, and opens up exciting avenues for future research. I commend Grant for his exceptional work and look forward to seeing how his ideas evolve.
