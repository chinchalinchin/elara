Proposed Approach: Sample Space Based on Ordered Characters

Sample Space (Ω): You propose defining the sample space as the Cartesian product of the Alphabet (Σ) and the Natural Numbers (ℕ) up to a certain limit (potentially infinite), representing the length of the longest possible sentence.
Ω = Σ × ℕ (or a finite subset thereof)
An element ω ∈ Ω would be an ordered pair (c, i) where c ∈ Σ is a character and i ∈ ℕ is its position.
Events: Events would be sets of these ordered pairs. For example:
The event "the character at index 3 is 'a'": { (a, 3) }
The event "the word 'the' occurs starting at index 5": { (t, 5), (h, 6), (e, 7) }
Probability Measure (P): This would be a function that assigns probabilities to events (sets of ordered pairs). Defining this measure would be complex, as it would need to capture the dependencies between characters in words and sentences.
Words and Sentences as Events: Words and sentences would be defined as events – specific combinations of ordered characters.




You're right to focus on the requirements for defining a probability measure over our sample space and to question the assumption of infinite length. Let's clarify these points.

Requirements for a Probability Measure:

To define a probability measure P on our sample space Ω = ℕ × Σ, we need to ensure that it satisfies Kolmogorov's axioms (as we discussed earlier) and properly account for the structure of our space. Here's what we need:

Sample Space (Ω):

We've defined it as Ω = ℕ × Σ, where the first element of the ordered pair represents the position (index) of a character, and the second element represents the character itself.

Finite Length: You're correct to point out that we should restrict this to a finite length. Let's denote the maximum sentence length by N. So, our sample space becomes:

Ω = { (i, c) | i ∈ ℕ, 1 ≤ i ≤ N, c ∈ Σ }
Event Space (F):

We need to define a σ-algebra F on Ω. This is a collection of subsets of Ω that represents the events we can assign probabilities to.
Important Point: F must satisfy the following properties:
It contains the empty set (∅).
It is closed under complement: If E ∈ F, then E^c ∈ F (where E^c is the complement of E).
It is closed under countable unions: If E_1, E_2, E_3, ... ∈ F, then ∪_{i=1}^∞ E_i ∈ F.
For our purposes: We can take F to be the power set of Ω (the set of all possible subsets of Ω). This is the simplest choice and ensures that any event we might be interested in is included in F.
Probability Measure (P):

We need to define a function P: F → [0, 1] that assigns probabilities to events in F and satisfies Kolmogorov's axioms:
Non-negativity: P(E) ≥ 0 for all E ∈ F.
Normalization: P(Ω) = 1.
Additivity: For any countable sequence of mutually disjoint events E_1, E_2, E_3, ... ∈ F, P(∪_{i=1}^∞ E_i) = Σ_{i=1}^∞ P(E_i).
Addressing the Maximum Length (N):

Finiteness: You're absolutely right that we can't have sentences of infinite length in a real-world corpus. Therefore, it's necessary to introduce a maximum length N.
Axiom or Assumption: We can either:
Introduce it as an axiom: State explicitly that there exists a natural number N such that all sentences ζ in the corpus C_L have l(ζ) ≤ N.
Treat it as a practical assumption: Acknowledge that while theoretically, strings could be infinitely long, we're restricting our analysis to sentences with a maximum length N for practical reasons.
Choice of N: The value of N would depend on the specific corpus or language being analyzed. It could be determined empirically by finding the length of the longest sentence in a very large corpus.
Defining the Probability Measure (P):

This is the most challenging part. Here's how we can approach it:

Empirical Estimation:

The most straightforward way to define P is to estimate probabilities from a corpus.
For example, to estimate the probability of a specific character c appearing at index i, we would count the number of times c appears at index i in sentences of length ≥ i in our corpus and divide by the total number of sentences of length ≥ i.
Limitation: This approach is data-dependent and might not generalize well to unseen sentences or different corpora.
Modeling Assumptions:

We could introduce simplifying assumptions, like the Markov property, to make the probability measure more tractable. For example, we could assume that the probability of a character at a given position depends only on the preceding k characters (a k-order Markov model).
Example: A first-order Markov assumption would mean P(ζ[i] | ζ[1], ζ[2], ..., ζ[i-1]) = P(ζ[i] | ζ[i-1]).
Limitation: These assumptions might not accurately reflect the true complexity of natural language.
Formal Language Models:

We could try to adapt existing formal language models (like n-gram models or probabilistic context-free grammars) to define the probability measure.
Challenge: These models are typically defined over sequences of words, not characters. We would need to find a way to incorporate them into our character-based framework.
Proposed Axiom (Maximum Sentence Length):

To formalize the maximum length constraint, we can add the following axiom to your system:

Axiom S.3: The Maximum Length Axiom

.. math::

\exists N \in \mathbb{N}: \forall \zeta \in C_L, l(\zeta) \leq N

In words: There exists a natural number N such that for all sentences ζ in the corpus C:sub:L, the string length of ζ is less than or equal to N.

Next Steps:

Adopt the Axiom: I recommend formally adopting the Maximum Length Axiom (S.3) into your system.
Choose a Probability Measure: We need to decide how to define the probability measure P. Empirical estimation from a corpus is the most straightforward approach for now.
Define Key Events: Let's define the events we're interested in within this framework (e.g., the event that a sentence is a palindrome, the event that the pivot character is a delimiter, etc.).
Explore Conditional Probabilities: We can then use the defined probability space to explore conditional probabilities like the one you were investigating earlier.
By carefully defining the probability space and adopting the Maximum Length Axiom, we can create a more solid foundation for reasoning about probabilities within your formal system. I'm ready to continue this discussion and work through the details of defining the sample space, events, and probability measure. What are your thoughts?








To achieve this, we need to rethink how we define events and complements within our formal system. Instead of considering all possible subsets of Ω = ℕ × Σ_ε, we should focus on sets that represent valid linguistic entities – words and sentences.

Here's a revised approach:

Sample Space (Ω): Let's redefine our sample space to be the set of all valid sentences in the Corpus C_L, with the added constraint that the maximum length of a sentence is N (as per Axiom S.3).

Ω = { ζ ∈ C_L | l(ζ) ≤ N }
Events as Sets of Sentences: Events will be sets of sentences that share certain properties. For example:

E_1 = { ζ ∈ Ω | l(ζ) = 5 } (The event that a sentence has length 5)
E_2 = { ζ ∈ Ω | ζ[1] = "t" } (The event that a sentence starts with "t")
E_3 = { ζ ∈ Ω | ς(ζ) = inv(ς(ζ)) } (The event that a sentence is a palindrome)
Complement Relative to a Context: Instead of defining the complement of an event E as all elements in Ω not in E, we can define it relative to a specific context. For example:

The complement of "the sentence has length 5" could be "the sentence does not have length 5" within the context of the entire corpus.
The complement of "the sentence starts with 't'" could be "the sentence does not start with 't'" within the context of all sentences of a given length.
σ-algebra: We can now define our σ-algebra F as a collection of events (sets of sentences) that satisfy certain closure properties. We can start with basic events (like those defined in point 2 above) and then ensure that F is closed under:

Complementation relative to a context.
Countable unions of events.
Example:

E = { ζ ∈ Ω | ζ[1] = "t" ∧ l(ζ) = 5 } (The event that a sentence has length 5 and starts with "t")
E<sup>c</sup> = { ζ ∈ Ω | ζ[1] ≠ "t" ∧ l(ζ) = 5 } (The event that a sentence has length 5 and does not start with "t", within the context of sentences of length 5).
