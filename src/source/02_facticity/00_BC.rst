    Of things that reciprocate as to implication of being, that which is in some way the cause of the other's being might perfectly sensibly be called prior in nature. And that there are some such cases is clear. FOr there being a human reciprocates as to implication of being with the true statement about it: if there is a human, the statement whereby we say that there is a human is true, and reciprocally--since if the statement whereby we say there is a human is true, there is a human. And whereas the true statement is in no way the cause of the thing's being, the thing does seem in some way to be the cause of the statement's being true. For it is because of the thing's being or not being that the statement is called true or false.
