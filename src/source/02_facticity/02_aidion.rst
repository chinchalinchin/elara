    We shall not cease from exploration
    And the end of all our exploring
    Will be to arrive where we started.
    And know the place for the first time.

    -- *Little Gidding V*, T.S. Eliot

    in time of daffodils(who know
    the goal of living is to grow)
    forgetting why,remember how
    
    in time of lilacs who proclaim
    the aim of waking is to dream,
    remember so(forgetting seem)

    in time of roses(who amaze
    our now and here with paradise)
    forgetting if,remember yes
    in time of all sweet things beyond
    whatever mind may comprehend,
    remember seek(forgetting find)
    
    and in a mystery to be
    (when time from time shall set us free)
    forgetting me,remember me”
