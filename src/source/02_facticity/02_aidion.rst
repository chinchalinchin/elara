Hymn To God, My God, In Sickness, 1623
--------------------------------------

    | Since I am coming to that holy room,
    |    Where, with thy choir of saints for evermore,
    | I shall be made thy music; as I come
    |    I tune the instrument here at the door,
    |    And what I must do then, think here before.
    |
    | Whilst my physicians by their love are grown
    |    Cosmographers, and I their map, who lie
    | Flat on this bed, that by them may be shown
    |    That this is my south-west discovery,
    | *Per fretum febris*, by these straits to die,
    |
    | I joy, that in these straits I see my west;
    |   For, though their currents yield return to none,
    | What shall my west hurt me? As west and east
    |   In all flat maps (and I am one) are one,
    |   So death doth touch the resurrection.
    |
    | Is the Pacific Sea my home? Or are
    |   The eastern riches? Is Jerusalem?
    | Anyan, and Magellan, and Gibraltar,
    |   All straits, and none but straits, are ways to them,
    |   Whether where Japhet dwelt, or Cham, or Shem.
    |
    | We think that Paradise and Calvary,
    |   Christ's cross, and Adam's tree, stood in one place;
    | Look, Lord, and find both Adams met in me;
    |   As the first Adam's sweat surrounds my face,
    |   May the last Adam's blood my soul embrace.
    |
    | So, in his purple wrapp'd, receive me, Lord;
    |   By these his thorns, give me his other crown;
    | And as to others' souls I preach'd thy word,
    |   Be this my text, my sermon to mine own:
    | "Therefore that he may raise, the Lord throws down."

Little Gidding V, 1942 
----------------------

    | What we call the beginning is often the end
    | And to make and end is to make a beginning.
    | The end is where we start from. And every phrase
    | And sentence that is right (where every word is at home,
    | Taking its place to support the others,
    | The word neither diffident nor ostentatious,
    | An easy commerce of the old and the new,
    | The common word exact without vulgarity,
    | The formal word precise but not pedantic,
    | The complete consort dancing together)
    | Every phrase and every sentence is an end and a beginning,
    | Every poem an epitaph. And any action
    | Is a step to the block, to the fire, down the sea's throat
    | Or to an illegible stone: and that is where we start.
    | We die with the dying:
    | See, they depart, and we go with them.
    | We are born with the dead:
    | See, they return, and bring us with them.
    | The moment of the rose and the moment of the yew-tree
    | Are of equal duration. A people without history
    | Is not redeemed from time, for history is a pattern
    | Of timeless moments. So, while the light fails
    | On a winter's afternoon, in a secluded chapel
    | History is now and England.
    |
    | With the drawing of this Love and the voice of this Calling
    |
    | We shall not cease from exploration
    | And the end of all our exploring
    | Will be to arrive where we started
    | And know the place for the first time.
    | When the last of earth left to discover
    | Is that which was the beginning;
    | At the source of the longest river
    | The voice of the hidden waterfall
    | And the children in the apple-tree
    |
    | Not known, because not looked for
    | But heard, half-heard, in the stillness
    | Between two waves of the sea.
    | Quick now, here, now, always--
    | A condition of complete simplicity
    | (Costing not less than everything)
    | And all shall be well and
    | All manner of thing shall be well
    | When the tongues of flames are in-folded
    | Into the crowned knot of fire
    | And the fire and the rose are one

    | in time of daffodils(who know  
    | the goal of living is to grow)  
    | forgetting why,remember how  
    |
    | in time of lilacs who proclaim  
    | the aim of waking is to dream,  
    | remember so(forgetting seem)  
    |
    | in time of roses(who amaze  
    | our now and here with paradise)  
    | forgetting if,remember yes  
    | in time of all sweet things beyond  
    | whatever mind may comprehend,  
    | remember seek(forgetting find)  
    |
    | and in a mystery to be  
    | (when time from time shall set us free)  
    | forgetting me,remember me”
