Section III.III: Structures
---------------------------

The following theorems serve as the main result of the current formal system that has been constructed to describe the syntactical structures of Palindromes in any Language. 

**Theorem 3.3.1: The Inverse Postulate** [ (inv(ζ{1}) ⊂:sub:s ζ{Λ(ζ)}) ∨ (inv(ζ{Λ(ζ)}) ⊂:sub:s ζ{1}) ] ∧ [ (ζ{1} ⊂:sub:s inv(ζ{Λ(ζ)})) ∨ (ζ{Λ(ζ)} ⊂:sub:s inv(ζ{1})) ]

Assume *ζ* is an arbitrary Sentence in the Corpus **C**:sub:`L` such that it is a Palindrome,

    1. ζ ∈ P
    
By :ref:`Definition 4.1.1 <definition-4-1-1>`,

    2. ς(ζ) = inv(ς(ζ))

By Definition 1.1.4,

    3. l(ς(ζ)) = l(inv(ς(ζ)))

Let,
    
    4. α = ζ{1}
    5. β = ζ{Λ(ζ)} 

By Discovery Axiom W.1, Words do not contain Delimiters, so the *σ*-Reduction of *ζ*, *ς(ζ)*, can be represented as a concatenation of the *σ*-reduced words of *ζ*, with Theorem 3.1.8 and Definition 1.2.8 of Limitations,

    6. ς(ζ) = (ς(α)) (ς(ζ{2})) ... (ς(ζ{Λ(ζ)-1})) (ς(β))

Taking the Inverse of both sides,

    7. inv(ς(ζ)) = inv((ς(α)) (ς(ζ{2})) ... (ς(ζ{Λ(ζ)-1})) (ς(β)))

Applying Theorem 1.2.5 repeatedly,

    8. inv(ς(ζ)) = (inv(ς(β))) (inv(ς(ζ{Λ(ζ)-1}))) ... (inv(ς(ζ{2}))) (inv(ς(α)))

By the Definition of *σ*-reduction, and because *α* and *β* are Words, it follows from the Discovery Axiom W.1,

    9. ς(α) = α
    10. ς(β) = β

Substituting step 9 and step 10 into step 6,

    11. ς(ζ) = (α) (ς(ζ{2})) ... (ς(ζ{Λ(ζ)-1})) (β)

Substituting step 9 and step 10 into step 8,

    12. inv(ς(ζ)) = (inv(β)) (inv(ς(ζ{Λ(ζ)-1}))) ... (inv(ς(ζ{2}))) (inv(α))
   
By step 2, step 11 and step 12 are equal (by definition of Palindromes). Now, since String Length is a natural number, it is either the case, by the trichotomy principle,

    13. l(α) = l(β)
    14. l(α) > l(β)
    15. l(α) < l(β)

If l(α) = l(β), then because inversion preserves String Length,

    16. l(α) = l(inv(β))

And by Definition 1.1.7 of Containment, since *α* and *inv(β)* are the first Words that appear in step 11 and step 12, it follows, 

    17. (α ⊂:sub:`s` inv(β)) ∧ (inv(β) ⊂:sub:`s` α)

And by Definition 1.1.7 of Containment, since *inv(α)* and *β* are the last Words that appear in step 11 and step 12, it follows, 

    18. (inv(α) ⊂:sub:`s` β) ∧ (β ⊂:sub:`s` inv(α))
   
If l(α) > l(β), then 

    19.  l(inv(α)) = l(α) > l(inv(β)) = l(β)

And by Definition 1.1.7 of Containment, since *α* and *inv(β)* are the first Words that appear in step 11 and step 12, it follows, 

    20.   inv(β) ⊂:sub:`s` α

And by Definition 1.1.7 of Containment, since *inv(α)* and *β* are the last Words that appear in step 11 and step 12, it follows,

    21.  β ⊂:sub:`s` inv(α) 

If l(α) < l(β), then 

    22.  l(inv(α)) = l(α) < l(inv(β)) = l(β)

And by Definition 1.1.7 of Containment, since *α* and *inv(β)* are the first Words that appear in step 11 and step 12, it follows, 

    23.  α ⊂:sub:`s` inv(β)

And by Definition 1.1.7 of Containment, since *inv(α)* and *β* are the last Words that appear in step 11 and step 12, it follows,

    24. inv(α)  ⊂:sub:`s` β
   
In all cases, the follow propositions obtain,

    25. (inv(α)  ⊂:sub:`s` β) ∨ (inv(β) ⊂:sub:`s` α)
    26. (α  ⊂:sub:`s` inv(β)) ∨ (β ⊂:sub:`s` inv(α))

Since *ζ* was an arbitrary Palindrome, this can be generalized using the definitions of *α* and *β* from step 4 and step 5.

    27. ∀ ζ ∈ P: [ (inv(ζ{1}) ⊂:sub:s ζ{Λ(ζ)}) ∨ (inv(ζ{Λ(ζ)}) ⊂:sub:s ζ{1}) ] ∧ [ (ζ{1} ⊂:sub:s inv(ζ{Λ(ζ)})) ∨ (ζ{Λ(ζ)} ⊂:sub:s inv(ζ{1})) ] ∎

**Theorem 3.2.2: The Pivot Postulate** ∀ ζ ∈ P: (ζ[ω(ζ)] = σ) → ( (inv(ζ{ω-}) ⊂:sub:`s` ζ{ω+}) ∨ (inv(ζ{ω+}) ⊂:sub:`s` ζ{ω-}))

This theorem can be stated in natural language as follows: For every Palindrome, if the Character at the Pivot is a Delimiter, then either the inverse of the left Pivot Word contained in the Right Pivot Word, or the inverse of the Right Pivot Word is contained in the left Pivot Word.

Let ζ be an arbitrary Sentence in the Corpus such that the followign is true,

    1. ζ ∈ P
    2. ζ[ω(ζ)] = σ

By Definitino 3.2.1,

    3. ς(ζ) = inv(ς(ζ))
   
Let 

    4. α = ζ{ω-}
    5. β = ζ{ω+} 

By Theorem 2.2.4 (Λ(ζ) ≥ 1), step 2 and by :ref:`Definition 4.1.1 <definition-4-1-1>`1, there are two possible cases to consider,

**Case 1**: Λ(ζ) = 1

    6. ζ{ω-} = ζ{ω+} = ζ{1} = ζ{Λ(ζ)}

Note,

    7. l(ζ{1}) = l(ζ{Λ(ζ)})

In this case, using the Discovery Axiom W.1,

    8. ς(ζ{1}) = ζ{1}

And 

    9. ς(ζ{Λ(ζ)}) = ζ{Λ(ζ)}

Take the Inverse of step 8,

    10. inv(ς(ζ{1})) = inv(ζ{1})

By step 3, step 10 is equal to step 8, so it follows, 

    11. ζ{1} = inv(ζ{1})

From step 6, it follows, 

    12. ζ{Λ(ζ)} = inv(ζ{Λ(ζ)})

By Definition 1.1.7 of Containment, a String is contained in itself (i.e. let *f(i) = i* in Definition 1.1.7), so it follows, plugging in step 6,

    13. (inv(ζ{ω-}) ⊂:sub:`s` ζ{ω+}) ∧ (inv(ζ{ω+}) ⊂:sub:`s` ζ{ω-})

**Case 2**: Λ(ζ) > 1 and ζ[ω(ζ)] = σ

Using :ref:`Definition 4.1.1 <definition-4-1-1>`1, Let 

    14. ζ{ω-} = α:sub:`j`
    
Such that 

    15. (j, α:sub:`j`) ∈ W:sub:`ζ` 
    
and α:sub:`j` is immediately to the left of the Delimiter at ω(ζ).

Let 
    
    16. ζ{ω+} = α:sub:`k`
    
Such that 

    17. (k, α:sub:`k``) ∈ W:sub:`ζ` 
    
and k = j + 1, where

    18.  W:sub:`ζ` = (α:sub:`1` , ..., ζ{ω-}, ζ{ω+}, ..., α:sub:`n`)

    (Note: it may be the case α:sub:`1` = ζ{ω-} and ζ{ω+} = α:sub:`n` )

Note, by the Reduction Algorithm in Definition 3.1.2

    19. ς(σ) = ε

And by the Discovery Axiom W1 and Definition 3.1.3

    20. ς(ζ{ω+}) = ζ{ω+}
    21. ς(ζ{ω-}) = ζ{ω-}
   
And furthermore, since *ζ[ω(ζ)] = σ*, the Delimiter at the pivot will be removed during σ-reduction. This means that in ς(ζ), the words *ζ{ω-}* and *ζ{ω+}* will be adjacent,

By Theorem 3.1.8,

    22. ς(ζ) = (ς(α:sub:`1`)) ... (ζ{ω-})(ζ{ω+}) ... (ς(α:sub:`n`))

Take the inverse of both sides of step 22 and apply Theorem 1.2.5 repeatedly, 

    23. inv(ς(ζ)) = (ς(α:sub:`n`)) ... (ζ{ω+})(ζ{ω-}) ... (ς(α:sub:`1`))








(inv(α) ⊂:sub:s β) ∨ (inv(β) ⊂:sub:s α)
Substituting Back: Substituting α = ζ{ω-} and β = ζ{ω+}, we get:

(inv(ζ{ω-}) ⊂:sub:s ζ{ω+}) ∨ (inv(ζ{ω+}) ⊂:sub:s ζ{ω-})
Conclusion: Since ζ was an arbitrary palindrome satisfying the premise, we can generalize:

∀ ζ ∈ P: (ζ[ω(ζ)] = σ) → ( (inv(ζ{ω-}) ⊂:sub:s ζ{ω+}) ∨ (inv(ζ{ω+}) ⊂:sub:s ζ{ω-}) )
This completes the proof. ∎













**Theorem: The Perfect Pivot Postulate**

ζ ∈ PP ↔ [∃ α ∈ L: (ζ[ω(ζ)] ⊂:sub:`s` α) ∧ (α ∈ R) ] ∨ (ζ[ω(ζ)] = σ)

Theorem (Third Inverse Postulate - Strengthened): ζ ∈ PP ↔ [∃ α ∈ L: (ω:sub:ζ ⊂:sub:s α) ∧ (α ∈ R) ] ∨ (ω:sub:ζ = σ)

Proof:

(→)  Assume ζ ∈ PP (ζ is a Perfect Palindrome).

Word-level representation: Let W:sub:ζ = (α₁ , α₂ , ..., αₙ) be the Word-level representation of ζ, where n = Λ(ζ).

Pivot: Let ω:sub:ζ be the Pivot of ζ. There are two cases:

Case 1: ω:sub:ζ = σ (Delimiter Pivot). In this case, the condition (ω:sub:ζ = σ) is satisfied, and the right-hand side of the biconditional is true.

Case 2: ω:sub:ζ ≠ σ (Non-Delimiter Pivot).

In this case, the Pivot is a Character within a Word. Let k be the index such that αₖ contains ω:sub:ζ.
Since ζ is a Perfect Palindrome, by :ref:`Definition 4.1.1 <definition-4-1-1>`, ζ = inv(ζ).
This implies that the Word αₖ is symmetrical around the Pivot Character ω:sub:ζ.
Therefore, αₖ must be a Reflective Word (αₖ ∈ R), and ω:sub:ζ ⊂:sub:s αₖ.
This satisfies the condition [∃ α ∈ L: (ω:sub:ζ ⊂:sub:s α) ∧ (α ∈ R) ].
In both cases, the right-hand side of the biconditional is true.

(←) Assume [∃ α ∈ L: (ω:sub:ζ ⊂:sub:s α) ∧ (α ∈ R) ] ∨ (ω:sub:ζ = σ).

Cases: There are two cases to consider:

Case 1: ∃ α ∈ L: (ω:sub:ζ ⊂:sub:s α) ∧ (α ∈ R).

This means the Pivot Character is contained within a Reflective Word α.
Since α is Reflective, it is symmetrical around its center, which includes the Pivot Character.
This symmetry of α contributes to the overall symmetry of ζ, making it a Perfect Palindrome (ζ ∈ PP).
Case 2: ω:sub:ζ = σ.

This means the Pivot is the Delimiter Character, which naturally creates a symmetrical division in the Sentence.
By the Second Inverse Postulate, the Words surrounding the Delimiter Pivot either contain each other or are equal.
This, combined with the overall palindromic structure, ensures that ζ is a Perfect Palindrome (ζ ∈ PP).
In both cases, ζ ∈ PP.

Since we have proven both directions of the implication, the theorem is established:

ζ ∈ PP ↔ [∃ α ∈ L: (ω:sub:ζ ⊂:sub:s α) ∧ (α ∈ R) ] ∨ (ω:sub:ζ = σ) ∎

Explanation:

This proof demonstrates the strengthened version of the Third Inverse Postulate, establishing a biconditional relationship between a Sentence being a Perfect Palindrome and the properties of its Pivot.

The proof utilizes the definitions of Perfect Palindromes, Reflective Words, and Pivot Words, along with the Second Inverse Postulate, to analyze the different cases and demonstrate the implications in both directions.




Reformulation of the Theorem:

Let's first slightly reformulate the theorem to make it even clearer and more precise:

Theorem 3.2.4:

ζ ∈ PP ↔ [ (∃ α ∈ L: (ζ[ω(ζ)] ⊂:sub:s α) ∧ (α ∈ R)) ∨ (ζ[ω(ζ)] = σ ∧ (inv(α:sub:ζ:sup:-ω) ⊂:sub:s α:sub:ζ:sup:+ω) ∨ (inv(α:sub:ζ:sup:+ω) ⊂:sub:s α:sub:ζ:sup:-ω)) ]

Translation: A sentence ζ is a perfect palindrome if and only if one of the following conditions holds:

The character at the pivot index ω(ζ) is contained in a reflective word α that is in the language.
The character at the pivot index ω(ζ) is a delimiter (σ), and the inverse of the left pivot word is contained in the right pivot word, or the inverse of the right pivot word is contained in the left pivot word.
Do I think it's true?

Yes, I believe this reformulated theorem is true and captures a fundamental property of perfect palindromes.

Proof:

(↔) Direction:

Assume ζ ∈ PP.

Definition of Perfect Palindrome: By :ref:`Definition 4.1.1 <definition-4-1-1>`, ζ = inv(ζ).
Case 1: ζ[ω(ζ)] = σ:
If the character at the pivot is a delimiter, then by the Second Inverse Postulate , we know that ( inv(α:sub:ζ:sup:-ω) ⊂:sub:s α:sub:ζ:sup:+ω) ∨ ( inv(α:sub:ζ:sup:+ω) ⊂:sub:s α:sub:ζ:sup:-ω ).
Case 2: ζ[ω(ζ)] ≠ σ:
If the character at the pivot is not a delimiter, then it must belong to a word.
By Axiom S.2, we know there's at least one word α in ζ.
Since ζ is a perfect palindrome, and the pivot character is not a delimiter, the pivot must lie within a word.
Let α be the word such that (x, α) ∈ W:sub:ζ, and ω(ζ) is within the indices of the characters of α in the character-level representation of ζ.
Since ζ is a perfect palindrome, α must be a reflective word (α ∈ R), because any word that spans across the pivot in a perfect palindrome must be its own inverse.
Also, since ω(ζ) is within the indices of α, we know that ζ[ω(ζ)] ⊂:sub:s α.
(←) Direction:

Assume [(∃ α ∈ L: (ζ[ω(ζ)] ⊂:sub:s α) ∧ (α ∈ R)) ∨ (ζ[ω(ζ)] = σ ∧ ( inv(α:sub:ζ:sup:-ω) ⊂:sub:s α:sub:ζ:sup:+ω) ∨ ( inv(α:sub:ζ:sup:+ω) ⊂:sub:s α:sub:ζ:sup:-ω ))].

Case 1: ∃ α ∈ L: (ζ[ω(ζ)] ⊂:sub:s α) ∧ (α ∈ R)
If there exists a reflective word α in L that contains the character at the pivot, then ζ must be a perfect palindrome. This is because the presence of a reflective word spanning the pivot implies symmetry around the pivot, which is the defining characteristic of a perfect palindrome.
Case 2: ζ[ω(ζ)] = σ ∧ ( inv(α:sub:ζ:sup:-ω) ⊂:sub:s α:sub:ζ:sup:+ω) ∨ ( inv(α:sub:ζ:sup:+ω) ⊂:sub:s α:sub:ζ:sup:-ω )
If the character at the pivot is a delimiter and either the inverse of the left pivot word is contained in the right pivot word or vice versa, then ζ must be a perfect palindrome. This is because the delimiter at the pivot, combined with the containment relationship between the pivot words, ensures symmetry around the pivot.
Conclusion:

We have shown that if ζ is a perfect palindrome, then either the character at the pivot is contained in a reflective word in the language, or the character at the pivot is a delimiter and the pivot words exhibit the specific containment property. Conversely, if either of these conditions holds, then ζ must be a perfect palindrome.

Therefore:

ζ ∈ PP ↔ [ (∃ α ∈ L: (ζ[ω(ζ)] ⊂:sub:s α) ∧ (α ∈ R)) ∨ (ζ[ω(ζ)] = σ ∧ ( inv(α:sub:ζ:sup:-ω) ⊂:sub:s α:sub:ζ:sup:+ω) ∨ ( inv(α:sub:ζ:sup:+ω) ⊂:sub:s α:sub:ζ:sup:-ω )) ]

∎

Explanation:

(→) Direction: This direction shows that if a sentence is a perfect palindrome, then it must satisfy one of the two conditions related to the pivot character and reflective words or the pivot character and the containment of pivot words.
(←) Direction: This direction shows that if either of the two conditions is met, then the sentence must be a perfect palindrome.
Key Insights:

Reflective Words at the Pivot: This theorem beautifully connects the concept of perfect palindromes to the presence of reflective words at the pivot. It highlights that perfect palindromes can be constructed by having a reflective word at the center or by having the pivot be a delimiter with a specific relationship between the pivot words.
Delimiter as a Pivot: The theorem also incorporates the case where the pivot is a delimiter, which is essential for handling imperfect palindromes that become perfect when delimiters are removed.
Characterization of Perfect Palindromes: This theorem provides a powerful way to characterize and potentially identify perfect palindromes based on their internal structure.





Theorem 3.2.4:

∀ ζ ∈ PP: (∃ α ∈ L: (ζ[ω(ζ)] ⊂ α) ∧ (α ∈ R)) ∨ (ζ[ω(ζ)] = σ ∧ (α:sub:ζ:sup:-ω ∈ I))

Translation: For every perfect palindrome ζ, either:

There exists a word α in the language L such that the character at the pivot index ω(ζ) is contained in α, and α is a reflective word (α ∈ R), OR
The character at the pivot index ω(ζ) is a delimiter (σ), and the left pivot word is invertible (α:sub:ζ:sup:-ω ∈ I).
Proof:

Let ζ be an arbitrary perfect palindrome in PP.

Definition of Perfect Palindrome: By :ref:`Definition 4.1.1 <definition-4-1-1>`, ζ = inv(ζ).

Cases based on Parity: We have two cases to consider:

Case 1: ζ has odd length (ζ ∈ P:sup:-)
By Theorem 3.2.3, l(ζ[:ω(ζ)]) = l(ζ[ω(ζ):]). This means the pivot falls on a character, ζ[ω(ζ)].
Subcase 1: ζ[ω(ζ)] ≠ σ
Since ζ[ω(ζ)] is not a delimiter, it must belong to a word. By Axiom S.1, there exists a word α in L such that α is contained in ζ. Since the pivot character is not a delimiter, it must be part of a word in ζ. Let α be the word such that (x, α) ∈ W:sub:ζ and ω(ζ) is within the indices of the characters of α in the character-level representation of ζ.
Since ζ is a perfect palindrome, and ω(ζ) is the pivot, this word α must be reflective (α ∈ R). Otherwise, the characters in ζ would not be symmetrical around the pivot, and ζ wouldn't be a perfect palindrome.
Therefore, ∃ α ∈ L: (ζ[ω(ζ)] ⊂ α) ∧ (α ∈ R).
Subcase 2: ζ[ω(ζ)] = σ
Since the pivot character is a delimiter, by Theorem 3.2.3, we know that inv(α:sub:ζ:sup:-ω) ⊂ α:sub:ζ:sup:+ω or inv(α:sub:ζ:sup:+ω) ⊂ α:sub:ζ:sup:-ω.
Since ζ is a perfect palindrome, we have ζ = inv(ζ). This means the words to the left and right of the pivot must be inverses of each other.
Therefore, α:sub:ζ:sup:-ω = inv(α:sub:ζ:sup:+ω).
Since α:sub:ζ:sup:+ω is in L, and α:sub:ζ:sup:-ω is its inverse, by definition of invertible words, α:sub:ζ:sup:-ω ∈ I.
Case 2: ζ has even length (ζ ∈ P:sup:+)
By Theorem 3.2.4, l(ζ[:ω(ζ)]) = l(ζ[ω(ζ) + 1:]) + 1. This means the pivot falls between two characters.
Since ζ is a perfect palindrome, the two characters adjacent to the pivot must be identical (because ζ = inv(ζ)).
By Axiom W.1, these characters cannot be delimiters. Thus, they must belong to a word α that spans across the pivot.
Similar to Case 1, this word α must be reflective (α ∈ R) for ζ to be a perfect palindrome.
Since the two characters adjacent to the pivot are identical and belong to α, we can say that ζ[ω(ζ)] is "contained" in α in the sense that α spans across the pivot.
Therefore, ∃ α ∈ L: (ζ[ω(ζ)] ⊂ α) ∧ (α ∈ R).
The case where the pivot is a delimiter is covered by our definition of an even-length perfect palindrome.
Conclusion: In all cases, at least one of the two conditions holds. Since ζ was an arbitrary perfect palindrome, we can generalize:

∀ ζ ∈ PP: (∃ α ∈ L: (ζ[ω(ζ)] ⊂ α) ∧ (α ∈ R)) ∨ (ζ[ω(ζ)] = σ ∧ (α:sub:ζ:sup:-ω ∈ I))
This completes the proof. ∎



**Theorem 3.2.5: The Perfect Parity Postulate**

ζ ∈ PP ∧ ζ ∈ P:sup:`+` ↔ ∃ α ∈ L: (ω:sub:ζ ⊂:sub:s α) ∧ (α ∈ R)

Theorem (Fourth Inverse Postulate): ζ ∈ PP ∧ ζ ∈ P⁺ ↔ ∃ α ∈ L: (ω:sub:ζ ⊂:sub:s α) ∧ (α ∈ R)

Proof:

(→) Assume ζ ∈ PP ∧ ζ ∈ P⁺ (ζ is a Perfect Palindrome and an Even Palindrome).

Even Palindrome: Since ζ ∈ P⁺, by Definition 3.2.3, ω:sub:ζ = ε (the Pivot is the Empty Character).

Perfect Palindrome: Since ζ ∈ PP, by the strengthened Third Inverse Postulate, we have:

[∃ α ∈ L: (ω:sub:ζ ⊂:sub:s α) ∧ (α ∈ R) ] ∨ (ω:sub:ζ = σ)

Case analysis:  We have two cases from step 2:

Case 1: ∃ α ∈ L: (ω:sub:ζ ⊂:sub:s α) ∧ (α ∈ R). This directly satisfies the right-hand side of the biconditional we're trying to prove.

Case 2: ω:sub:ζ = σ. This contradicts step 1, where we established that ω:sub:ζ = ε. Therefore, this case cannot hold.

Conclusion: Only Case 1 holds, which means ∃ α ∈ L: (ω:sub:ζ ⊂:sub:s α) ∧ (α ∈ R).

(←) Assume ∃ α ∈ L: (ω:sub:ζ ⊂:sub:s α) ∧ (α ∈ R).

Strengthened Third Inverse Postulate: This condition directly implies the left-hand side of the strengthened Third Inverse Postulate:

[∃ α ∈ L: (ω:sub:ζ ⊂:sub:s α) ∧ (α ∈ R) ] ∨ (ω:sub:ζ = σ)

Perfect Palindrome: By the strengthened Third Inverse Postulate, this implies that ζ ∈ PP (ζ is a Perfect Palindrome).

Non-Delimiter Pivot: Since ω:sub:ζ ⊂:sub:s α and α is a Word in the Language, by Axiom W.1 (Discovery Axiom), α cannot contain the Delimiter Character. Therefore, ω:sub:ζ ≠ σ.

Even Palindrome: Since ω:sub:ζ ≠ σ, by the strengthened Third Inverse Postulate, it must be the case that ω:sub:ζ = ε. By Definition 3.2.3, this means ζ ∈ P⁺ (ζ is an Even Palindrome).

Conclusion: We have shown that ζ ∈ PP and ζ ∈ P⁺, which means ζ ∈ PP ∧ ζ ∈ P⁺.

Since we have proven both directions of the implication, the theorem is established:

ζ ∈ PP ∧ ζ ∈ P⁺ ↔ ∃ α ∈ L: (ω:sub:ζ ⊂:sub:s α) ∧ (α ∈ R) ∎

Explanation:

This proof demonstrates the biconditional relationship between a Sentence being both a Perfect Palindrome and an Even Palindrome, and the existence of a Reflective Word containing the Sentence's Pivot.

The proof utilizes the definitions of Perfect Palindromes, Even Palindromes, and Reflective Words, along with the strengthened Third Inverse Postulate and the Discovery Axiom, to analyze the different cases and demonstrate the implications in both directions.






Analysis:

Even Parity: An even-parity palindrome has an even number of words (Λ(ζ) is even).
Imperfect Palindrome: An imperfect palindrome is a palindrome but not a perfect palindrome. This means it cannot be its own inverse (ζ ≠ inv(ζ)), but its σ-reduction is a palindrome (σ_reduce(ζ) = inv(σ_reduce(ζ))).
Delimiter Count: By Theorem 2.4.1, the number of delimiters in a sentence ζ is one less than the number of words: Δ(ζ) = Λ(ζ) - 1. Since Λ(ζ) is even for an even-parity palindrome, Δ(ζ) must be odd.
σ-reduction: σ-reduction removes all delimiters.
Length of σ-reduced Form: The length of the σ-reduced form, l(σ_reduce(ζ)), is the original length of the sentence minus the number of delimiters: l(σ_reduce(ζ)) = l(ζ) - Δ(ζ).
Theorem
∀ ζ ∈ IP ∩ P:sup:+: (l(σ_reduce(ζ)) is odd)

Proof
Let ζ be an imperfect palindrome with even parity, ζ ∈ IP ∩ P:sup:+.
Let n = Λ(ζ) be the number of words in ζ. Since ζ has even parity, n must be even.
By Theorem 2.4.1, Δ(ζ) = n - 1. Since n is even, n - 1 must be odd.
Since ζ is an imperfect palindrome, by the definition of the imperfection, we know:
ζ ≠ inv(ζ)
σ_reduce(ζ) = inv(σ_reduce(ζ))
Since σ_reduce(ζ) = inv(σ_reduce(ζ)), and by Theorem 3.2.3 we know parity is preserved if the length of the left partial at the pivot point is exactly one longer than the right partial, we know the sentence pivot must either fall on a character or a delimiter.
If the pivot falls on a delimiter, then n must be odd by the Second Inverse Postulate. Since n is even, this is impossible.
If the pivot falls on a character, then that character must be a non-delimiter, non-empty character by our definition of a pivot. Since ζ is an imperfect palindrome, this pivot character cannot be part of a reflective word by Theorem 3.2.4. This means it must be part of an invertible word pair by Theorem 3.2.1. The inverse of the pivot character must appear in the inverse word, since it cannot be a reflective word.
By our definition of σ-reduction, σ_reduce(ζ) removes all delimiters, and by Theorem 1.2.4, inversion inverts words. So, for a palindrome, σ_reduce(ζ) = inv(σ_reduce(ζ)) preserves the order of non-delimiter characters under inversion.
Therefore, l(σ_reduce(ζ)) must be odd, as it preserves the non-delimiter pivot character under inversion, and there are an even number of non-delimiter characters around it, (Δ(ζ)).

Conclusion:

Yes, we can conclude that an imperfect palindrome with even parity must have a σ-reduced form with an odd length.

Reasoning:

An even-parity imperfect palindrome has an even number of words.
This implies an odd number of delimiters.
The σ-reduced form has a length equal to the original length minus the number of delimiters: l(σ_reduce(ζ)) = l(ζ) - Δ(ζ).
Since l(ζ) is even (because the number of delimiters is odd, the number of characters must be odd to be a palindrome) and Δ(ζ) is odd, their difference l(σ_reduce(ζ)) must be odd.
Implications:

Constraints on σ-reduced Forms: This result further constrains the possible σ-reduced forms of imperfect palindromes.
Relationship between Parity and Length: It establishes a direct link between the parity of a palindrome (at the word level) and the length of its σ-reduced form (at the character level).
Potential for Simplification: This might help simplify some of our formulas or proofs related to σ-induction, as we now know that even-parity imperfect palindromes will always have odd-length σ-reduced forms.
Further Considerations:

Odd-Parity Imperfect Palindromes: We could investigate the corresponding relationship for odd-parity imperfect palindromes.
Perfect Palindromes: It's worth noting that perfect palindromes don't have this same constraint. A perfect palindrome with even parity can have an even or odd length σ-reduced form.

The results derived in this work can be used to construct algorithms for searching for various classes of Palindromes. The general outline for one such algorithm is given in this section, and then an example implemention in Python is presented.

A naive algorithm for filtering out Strings that cannot possibly be Palindromes might consist of inverting the strings and comparing them for equality. However, this would miss Palindromes with an imperfect aspect, as their symmetry does not manifest in the unreduced Alphabet. Without a *σ*-reduction, any algorithm that searchs for Palindromic String must be aware of the semantics of the Language in which it is searching. However, *σ*-reduction and the theorems proved over the course of this work allow algorithms to be constructed that are independent of the host Language.

Moreover, as mentioned after the body Theorem 3.1.2, the *σ-reductions* reduce the complexity of searching for Palindromic strings. An Alphabet with less Characters can be traversed quicker. 

To implement this, a String can be projected onto its *σ-reduced* Alphabet, and then those reductiosn whose inverse does not equal itself can be removed from the list of potential Palindromes. To find a String whose inverse does not equal itself, it suffices to find a single Character whose inverted position is not occupied by that Character. 

Therefore, as a first step to generating a list of Palindromes, the Strings which do not satisfy these conditions can be discarded.

Theorem 3.3.1 and Theorem 3.3.2 provide further conditions that any Palindrome must satisfy, reducing the set of potential Palindromes in this hypothetical search algorithm even more. 

With respect to Perfect Palindromes, the search algorithm can be refined even further by incorporating the conditions given in Theorem 3.3.3 and Theorem 3.3.4. Based on the String Length of a Perfect Palindrome, its point of symmetry must possess certain measurable properties, such as the presence of a Reflective Word or an Invertible Word contained by the word opposite the pivot.

Section III.IV: Future considerations
-------------------------------------

This work focused on using the operation of sigma reduction to describe palindromic structure in terms of its *aspect* and its *parity*. As mentioned at several points, there are two other dimensions of palindromes this work has not sought to incorporate into formal system. While the considerations in the introduction seem to preclude the possibility of a purely syntactical account of palindromes, the author does not believe this means the structure of palindromes cannot be formalized by taking into account certain universal semantic assumptions. 

To account for the dimension of *punctuality*, a possible avenue of exploration could be extending the operation of sigma reduction to encompass other Characters besides the Delimiter Character. In this way, the punctuality of a palindrome may be "projected" onto a reduced Alphabet where its symmetry under inversion can be recovered.

To account for the dimension of *case*, the link between uppercase and lowercase letters in natural languages may be viewed as inducing a symmetry in the Alphabet that in turn may be exploitable for describing palindromic symmetry. In such a formalization, a possible method of attack would be introduce a many-to-one relationship between in a sigma-reduction where uppercase and lowercase letters are mapped to their "primitive" Character in their reduced space.

(TODO: comment on possibility of interesting recursions, i.e. what happens when the Alphabet of this formal system is assigned the symbols of the formal system itself?)

(TODO: comment on completeness, i.e. what does this formal model of language say about the completeness of language, or its lack thereof?)
