- **Perfect Palindromes**: A palindrome that is exactly the same forwards as backwards, e.g. ``strap on no parts``
- **Imperfect Palindrome**: A palindrome that is not exactly the same when reversed due to delimiters (*delimiter asymmetry*), e.g. ``borrow or rob``
- **Punctured Palindromes**: A palindrome that is not exactly the same when reversed due to punctuation (*punctuation asymmetry*), e.g. ``no, it is opposition``

.. topic:: Palindromic Pivot Preposition

    A *pivot preposition* is an invertible grammatical structure commonly used in palindromes to center its inversion. 

    - **Perfect Pivots**: ``on no``, ``saw I was``
    - **Imperfect Pivots**: ``as a``, ``now on``

    These lists are by no means exhaustive. 

.. important::

    This is a heuristic definition of pivots. See :ref:`Palindromics <palindromics>` for a more rigorous treatment.
