III: Father's Lullaby
---------------------

| Dear child, the monsters under bed
|   Are not just make believe.
| They lurk in shadows overhead
|   And offer no reprieve.
|
| Dear sweetling, sleep with open eye
|   And guard your dreams at night.
| Ignore your mother's lullaby,
|   Keep candles burning bright.
|
| Beware the lair that closets hide,
|   The racks of their disguise,
| The suits and ties, the cuffs that slide
|   And cloak them from your eyes.
|
| Fear not the slash of sharpened claws,
|   The flashing terror brief,
| But stamps that mark the written clause
|   With laws of fierce belief.
|
| What evil deeds those stories tell
|   Prepare your heart to meet
| The formal world where heroes fell
|   To wander incomplete.
