VI: Windfall
------------

| if every word is written on the wind
| then every sentence grows into a storm. 
| 
| so when you breathed my breath, then gasped and grinned,
| in fronts the future gales began to form.
| 
| and when you spoke, that tempest swelled to swarm,
| converging now to sweep my thoughts away
| 
| right back to where our swirling words perform,
| around our promise howling disarray.
|
| our fate is spelled in thunder struck display,
| in lightning arcs the clouds now ionize. 
| 
| my every breath is filled with yesterday,
| each passing sigh is mixed with our demise.
| 
| the silent rain begins to tell our tale.
| in shallow breaths, your words i still inhale. 

.. the silent rain is like a lashing flail.
.. the silent rain in lines begins to flail
.. the silent rain in puddles tells our tale.
.. the silent rain begins to tell our tale.
