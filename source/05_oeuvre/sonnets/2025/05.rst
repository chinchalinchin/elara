VI: Windfall
------------

| if every word is written on the wind
| then every sentence grows into a storm. 
| 
| so when you swayed beneath the moon and grinned,
| the future gales in fronts began to form.
| 
| and when you spoke, that tempest swelled to swarm,
| converging now to sweep my thoughts away
| 
| right back to where our swirling words perform,
| around our promise currents ricochet.
|
| our fate is spelled in thundering display,
| in lightning threads the clouds now ionize. 
| 
| my gasping breath is filled with yesterday,
| each passing sigh is mixed with our demise.
| 
| so when my mind grows old and body frail,
| in shallow breaths, this moment i'll inhale.
