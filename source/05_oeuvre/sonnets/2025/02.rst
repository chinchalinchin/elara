III: The Myth of Geese
----------------------

| the royal flock across the river banks
| in molting courts proclaim the summer theirs,
| its peasant fields now owned by inner ranks
| of scheming birds engaged in crude affairs.
| 
| a secret circle forms the noble core,
| the princelings graze, reposed on flowing knolls.
| as sentry towers hiss away the poor 
| and watch the ground in swiveled neck patrols.
| 
| they chase the beggars pecking fields for seed,
| these pegasi that charge with flightless wings,
| dominion boundless as their princelings' greed.
| the empire hunger breeds the feathered kings.
| 
| the heralds honk their liege with trumpet tongue 
| and sing the myth of geese to gosling young.
