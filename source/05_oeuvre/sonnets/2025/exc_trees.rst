| observe the birch and how it grows,
| the twisted course of skyward arc.
|
| its roots secrete a sap that flows
| and hardens into plates of bark.
| 
| in silent columns, the years accrue 
| to ashen hosts that span the field. 
| 
| 
|
| my blood ascends through webs of veins
| to reach my fingers catching sun.
| 
| its warmth is spread, but none remains
| when blood returns, its circuit done.
