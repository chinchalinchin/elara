VIII: The Lives of Kites
------------------------

| some years ago there came an errant kite
| from heights unknown, descending breeze with glee.
| 
| in drifting down, it veered off course in flight
| and snagged upon the tallest poplar tree.
|
| despite the frantic pull of frightened wind,
| the kite was lost and stranded far astray.  
|
| each time i passed, its color waned and thinned
| from red to pink, from pink to ghastly gray.
|
| it languished there upon its poplar perch
| until its silk dissolved to drooping thread
|
| and then one day there came a sudden lurch
| as cotton clouds of seed were flung and shed.
|
| the kite's remains reclaimed their place on high
| as slivers shimmered sweetly through the sky
