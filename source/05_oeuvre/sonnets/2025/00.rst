I: Sonnet for the Demented
--------------------------

| There are but few who taste the hemlock blue,
| While fortune swings like necks from noose and nail;
| A minute gone they follow through in queue,
| So spared the withered touch of Time gone frail.
|
| If choosing first, then Time will stalk the mind,
| And steady quick yet slow concealed from prey;
| As hunters know to never scare the find,
| In careful step, it bides itself each day.
|
| Oh, Memory! The jigsawed tower self!
| How easily you crumble from a tap!
| A single book that Time removes from shelf,
| And into piles left upon his lap.
|
| Through glass, reflects a stranger mirror cast,
| Each ageless moment til you breath your last.
