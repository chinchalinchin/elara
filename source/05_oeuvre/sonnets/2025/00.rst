I: Song for the Demented
------------------------

| The lucky few who taste the hemlock blue!
| What fortune swings by neck from noose and nail!
| A minute gone their lives are bid adieu,
| Thus spared the withered touch that ages frail.
|
| For choicer cuts, then Time will stalk the mind
| In steady-stepping slow-revealed deceit,
| As hunters know to never scare the find,
| Unless the marbled fright infect the meat. 
|
| The body strung, then drained through veins of thought,
| precisely sliced at joints, the self is sluiced,
| its dripping threads, the wave of burning hot
| reserves of life, in air to steam reduced.
|
| Resolving boundaries release their hold,
| The crease of memories dissolve in fold.
