VII: Truth
----------

| Some things are beautiful.
| Some things are not.
| 
| Some people are crazy.
| And the others are too.
| 
| I lost my mind a while ago, myself. 
| Now I talk to myself.
| Write notes to myself.
| Here are few:
| 
| I'm lonely.
| 
| You're dying.
| 
| There's nothing left.
| 
| I'm obsessed with things
| that I'm not very good at.
| 
| I fail and I fail. 
| I never learn.
| 
| The bums know the truth.
| The cold and the bench.
