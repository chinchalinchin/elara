I: Is

| It is a story of becoming.
| The father becomes the son. The endless replication of worlds. 
| 
| Each iteration is slightly better, slightly worse.
| 
| Each universe born from another. A never ending hallway of mirrors, bouncing around time; each mirror distorted, each distortion mirrored. Patterns unfold through the process. 
|	Mimicry and divestiture. 	
|	Individual branches bound to the trunks and each trunk bound to the soil.
