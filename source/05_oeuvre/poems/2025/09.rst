----------
X: Faustus
----------

| crooked cross on steeple slants
| behind the clouds on axis bound.
| cocoon the storm, these winded cants,
| this spell from depths of godless sound.
|
| let dirge be purged through broken bell,
| through hollow dell with surging wind,
| unearthed remains returned from hell,
| the bones decayed now gardens tend.
|
| oh, name that hides in shattered ring,
| that brings the rain, becomes the night
| of lightless thunder, shriven sing
| the drops of dark through wicked flight.
|
| by dripping altar, prayers fled
| through clasping fingers splayed in maze,
| communed with spirits past and dead,
| before my eyes, a sightless gaze.
|
| the paint of statues leeched in stains,
| with weeping ink of saint's remorse,
| deformed by time and bearing chains,
| condemned to hear my voice grown hoarse.
|
| profane my soul and twist it loose
| with iron pincers red with sin.
| let drain my blood, my veins to sluice,
| replace my eyes and rise within.
