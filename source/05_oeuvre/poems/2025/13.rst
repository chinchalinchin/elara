XIV: Nihilism 
-------------

| the weight of guilt
| as dense as stars
| with burning cores
| that fuse their parts.
| 
| where did it start?
| the thread comes loose
| and eats its tail.
| a endless loop
| that leads to now
|
|    i watched my father die in blinding pain
|    and then my mother lost her mind.
|
| then switches back
| through stiches sewn
| in younger years
|
|    my friends are gone.
|    abandoned, why? 
|
| the senseless acts
| strangers perform 
| with your own hands.
|
| a leaden heart
| that sinks below
| the surface waves
| to depths that stretch
| around the world
| and wish it were 
| another way.
| 
| my empty heart 
| that once felt love.
| her laugh was like
| a perfect song,
| a single sound
| enough to hold
| a moment's peace
| before it fades.
|
|    she left and never said good bye. 
| 
| my mind is shot
| with burning holes
| that leak a thought
| of molten make:
|
| your life is done.
| your words are through.
| you had your chance.
|
|    it all is gone.
