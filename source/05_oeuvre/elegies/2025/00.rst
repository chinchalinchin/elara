I: Elemental Elegy
------------------

| The day I sat by death's grey bed,
| I told a story green and true
| of city bricks stacked proud and red,
| of silver paths the stars imbue
| with golden hue we might have tread,
| your slowing breath as cold as blue.
|
| I spoke the words to yellow skin
| and told of days in white to come.
| Your mouth, with specks of purple grin,
| and fingers stretched so pale and numb,
| my name, you said, so clear, so thin--
| with final grasp, in black succumb.
|
| Oh--Father, Father--brass horns blare!
| You string your harp with diamond thread
| and leave in me this slate despair!
| What crystal tears in eyes now shed?
| What pearl is formed by sightless stare?
| What platinum found in prayers pled?
|
| The oak around your body wraps
| as shoots of pine through spine are grown.
| In loam the roots will bind your scrap
| despite the flowers laid on stone.
| Each time I come a stem I snap,
| for only Earth deserves your bone.
