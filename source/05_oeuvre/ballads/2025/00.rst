I: Absurdity
------------

| One lovely Thursday afternoon
|   Two billion years ago,
| A star embraced by arcs of moon,
|   Conceived despair and woe. 
| 
| A sordid joke of yellow-red,
|    Ribald and mocking jape:
| To burn with heat in circles dead
|    with no hope of escape
|
| So solace cursed upon a point,
|    it drew a mighty plan
| As spinning round its lock and joint
|    its ending now began.
| 
| The heaving mass of goo morassed
|    then gurgled once and sighed;
| A rattle scream of flames harassed
|    what silent void denied. 
| 
| The sacrificial rings were flung
|   in sprays across the sky;
| The interstitial threads then wrung
|   as ropes they bound untie. 
|
| And in these fictions fracture facts:
|    A single atom forged
| And bellow blown through heaven's tracts
|    to find itself disgorged. 
| 
| The crush of black, once unobserved,
|    in fire found its sight.
| The atom woke from dreams unnerved
|    in sailing stream of flight. 
| 
| Without a frame, it screamed in vain
|    Through paralactic curves
| That weave the sieves with cluttered skein
|    Of dark galactic nerves. 
|
| Commotion drowned, it gazed about
|    along the ends it aimed:
| The bluest gem beyond a doubt
|    the cosmos ever named. 
| 
| It wept to see a brilliant Earth,
|    the fate bestowed by chance,
| And in its cackles rose a mirth
|    expressed in photon's dance. 
|
| It splashed the surface spinning fast,
|    now lost amid the sea. 
| The water rose at what trespassed,
|    mistook it for debris.
|
| The liquid swarm convened in waves,
|    to flood the tiny core.
| They stripped and pried, as hunger craves
|    and always wants for more. 
|
| The terror flashed, as pulled apart,
|   its briefly tasted life
| now disappeared before its start 
|   beneath the wetted knife. 
|
| So bittersweet, by shades complete, 
|   resigned into the black,
| the atom met its end on feet 
|   and braced for last attack.
|
| But fortune found where will converged,
|   as snatched from death it gasped
| And saw from depths the land emerged,
|   where brethren all were clasped.
|
| A molecule of carbon made
|   from crystal network cast
| through jointed links of atom braid
|   that helix ghosts amassed. 
|
| Began the age of afterbirth, 
|   of structure spat in space,
| originating blest on Earth,
|   atomic interface. 
|
| Now watch along the webbing sewn
|   the single atom weave
| Through warps and wefts and whetted stone,
|   the knits of stellar sleeve.
