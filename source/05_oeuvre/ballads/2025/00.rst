I: Absurdity
------------

| One lovely Thursday afternoon
|   two billion years ago,
| A star encased by arcs of moon,
|   embraced despair and woe. 
| 
| This sordid joke of yellow-red,
|    This sneering, mocking jape:
| To burn with heat, on axis sped
|    with no hope of escape.
|
| So solace cursed upon a point,
|    it drew its final plan
| As spinning round its lock and joint
|    its ending now began.
| 
| The heaving mass of goo morassed
|    then gurgled once and sighed;
| A rattle scream of flames harassed
|    what silent void belied. 
| 
| The sacrificial rings were flung
|   in sprays across the sky;
| The interstitial threads then wrung
|   as ropes once bound untie. 
|
| And in these fictions fracture facts:
|    A single atom forged
| and bellow blown through heaven's tracts
|    to find itself disgorged. 
| 
| The crush of black, once unobserved,
|    in fire found its sight.
| The atom woke from dreams unnerved
|    in sailing stream of flight. 
| 
| Without a frame, it screamed in vain
|    through parallactic curves
| that weave the sieves with cluttered skein
|    Of dark galactic nerves. 
|
| Commotion drowned, it gazed about
|    along the ends it aimed:
| The bluest gem beyond a doubt
|    the cosmos ever named. 
| 
| It wept to see a brilliant Earth,
|    the fate bestowed by chance,
| and in its cackles rose a mirth
|    expressed in photon's dance. 
|
| It splashed the surface spinning fast,
|    now lost amid the sea. 
| The water rose at what trespassed,
|    mistook it for debris.
|
| The liquid swarm convened in waves,
|    to flood the tiny core.
| They stripped and pried, as hunger craves
|    and always wants for more. 
|
| The terror flashed, as pulled apart,
|   its briefly tasted life
| now disappeared before its start 
|   beneath the wetted knife. 
|
| So bittersweet and incomplete, 
|   resigned into the black,
| the atom braced for ends to meet 
|   in swirling last attack.
|
| But fortune finds where will converged,
|   as snatched from death it gasped
| and saw from depths the land emerged,
|   where brethren all were clasped.
|
| A molecule of carbon made
|   from crystal network cast
| through jointed links of atom braid
|   that helix ghosts amassed. 
|
| Began the age of afterbirths, 
|   of structure spat in space,
| originating blest on Earth's
|   atomic interface. 
|
| Now watch along the webbing sewn
|   the single atom weave
| Through warps and wefts and whetted stone,
|   the knits of stellar sleeve.

.. epigraph::

  Hi Grant,

  Rejections suck, we get it. But, hey, you are doing the thing! You should celebrate that you are sending your work out into the world.

  We're sorry to say that Absurdity is not quite right for us at this time.

  We hope you'll consider trying us again in the future.

  Reader Notes:

  Reader 1 - I thought I hated this as first, but it grew on me when I caught the rhyme. I dunno.

  Reader 2 - This poet has a really excellent way with rhyme and meter. And I particularly enjoyed the lines that internally rhymed, particularrly the verses that did it twice.

  "Without a frame, it screamed in vain/ through parallactic curves/ that weave the sieves with clutter skein/ Of dark galactic nerves."

  This is one where I really love the lyricism of it, how it sounds when spoken, but I am not particuarlly engrossed by the subject.

  Reader 3 - I agree about the rhyme and meter - itâ€™s very well written.

  However, and I feel bad for saying this, but I found it too long and boring for my tastes.

  Reader 4 - Hmmm maybe it's how i read it, but I felt like a lot of the rhymes didn't quite hit for me. Like somehow felt off a bit. But they have such a way with language and so many clever word choices, that I definitely WANTED to like it more. Also, I agree with Reader 3 - the story didn't manage to pull me in.
