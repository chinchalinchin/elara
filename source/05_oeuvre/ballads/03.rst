The Mad Ballad of Sad Cracked Jack
----------------------------------

Part I: Thalia
--------------

| The question beggars even now
|   for answers we still lack.
| No one has ever said the how
|   of what that cracked our Jack.
|
| He woke that day and heard the song
|   that framed his steps with beat, 
| the meter stick that smacked along
|   behind his fuzzled feet. 
|
| At first he thought he dreamt the verse,
|   these words you read unfold,
| but when he thinks the thoughts recurse
|   And seep through pages' mould. 
|
| Aghast he jolts and cries aloud, 
|   "What trickster plays these tricks?"
| Then shocked to find his speech endowed
|   with stresses timed to ticks.
|
| Alas, if Jack had only known 
|   the furies fate had loosed--
| "What furies now?" His groan
|   reply to rhymes reduced. 
|
| What fatal flaw entrapped this man?
|   "I'm just an office clerk!"
| But forces orchestrate a plan
|   no human born can shirk.
|
| In boxer briefs, he stumbles out,
|   escapes from bed to hall,
| and every inch he runs to rout
|   the rhythm's faster call. 
|
| In morning light, the very sight 
|   of frantic Jack alerts
| the neighborhood to pending blight
|   of curse this line asserts.
|
| "Oh, neighbors, please, receive my plea!
|   There's something very wrong!"
| He cries with gasp from bended knee,
|   "I only speak in song!"
|
| A single friend then steps on stage,
|   so named to fit the bill,
| for names are fate and fettered wage;
|   They called her lovely Jill. 
| 
| "Jack? What the hell is going on? Are you okay?"
|
| At that our Jack is taken back,
|   her voice as clear as glass
| with not a hint of verse to track
|   through mazes long and crass.
|
| "How can it be!? An ask so free
|   while I to scheme conform!"
| His diction sweeps anastrophe,
|   mosaics teeming swarm.
|
| She kneels to him and whispers soft,
|   a voice as kind as cane,
| the type that beats, not sweet but loft
|   to strike the skin with pain. 
|
| "Are you on drugs or something else?"
|
| Now Jill, this dame, the missus made
|   to fill the damsel role,
| the unsuspecting victim played
|   To ballad's very goal.
|
| These words are met with wide-eyed stare
|   as Jack realized his plight;
| He hears the lines designs prepare,
|   the ending rhymes invite. 
|
| "Oh, listen, Jill, and listen well!"
|   He takes her hand in his, 
| "These words that flow are not a spell,
|   they simply are what is! 
|
| "I hear the force that cracks the shape
|   incessant stresses bind!"
| He cries as crowds surround to gape
|   at madness here enshrined. 
| 
| "I see," She nods, but doesn't see, 
|   and picks him up to walk,
| "Perhaps," She says, "It's time to flee,"
|   and hauls our Jack in shock.
| 
| By hand he's led while thoughts digress,
|   absurdity in tow. 
| And spanned by doubt the thoughts obsess
|   unheard except through flow. 
|
| As doors are slammed, the cats are scrammed
|   from cushions where they sat,
| And leaning in as Jill enjambed,
|   "We need to have a chat
|
| About the--fact--" she stops mid-sound, 
|   and measures out her tone,
| as slowly wound on axis bound,
|   her speech is ground and thrown,
|
| "About the fact you seem irate,"
|   She says while tongue contorts
| Around retorts that resonate
|   with words this verse consorts,
|
| "And not to mention halfway nude,"
|    She says with glance that proved,
| "Let's find you something more subdued,"
|    But Jack cannot be moved. 
|  
| "Why do you rhyme? You're part of it!"
|   In anger, Jack explodes. 
| "This horrid crime," His words are spit,
|   "Explain what fate unloads!"
|
| Beneath her brow, her eyes express
|   concern through gems of blue,
| "You're clearly broken by some stress,
|   Now tell it to me true!"
|
| Attacked by cackles, Jack, he laughs,
|   "Yes! Stress! The very pest!
| The force that binds these epigraphs
|   And leaves me most distressed!"
| 
| "Your speech is weird and most perturbed,"
|   Her tone now wavers weak,
| "The implication is disturbed,"
|   As rhymes begin to leak. 
|
| "Disturbed is just the word I'd pick
|   describing my disease. 
| It strickens me a lunatic 
|   and swings me by trapeze.
|
| Despair becomes the one sole choice,"
|   Laments a weary Jack,
| "Unfairly drummed by cunning voice,
|   alone and left to crack."
|
| This lonely lack, unpacked by Jill,
|   now spurs her senseless heart,
| "Oh Jack, what's wrong? For me distill
|   what ails your world through art?"
|
| Oh Jack, Oh Jack, this foolish track
|   will lead to Jill's demise.
| By now he knows, there's no way back,
|   but still defiant sighs, 
|
| "I woke today and found the world
|   explained by verse unheard
| By anyone but me," Unfurled
|   his words to heights absurd.
|
| Confusion swirls her face anew, 
|   perplexing facts askew,
| "And does it speak of me and you?
|   What ends that might ensue?"
|
| "It does! It says that you are next,
|   that fate has bound our names,
| If cursed I am, then curse has vexed
|   us both to play its games." 
|
| "If that's the case, then if I play--"
|   She pauses, lost in thought,
| "It's hard to pick a word to say--"
|   And thoughtless finds the spot.
|
| And now the players number two,
|   for two the game is made.
| And now the stacks they anted grew
|   against the pair they played.
|
| A pairing told in pages' fold
|   of arcs that never miss--
| Her voice remarks through mutters rolled, 
|   "--the flying fuck is this?"
|   
| "You hear it too?" As shocked as she, 
|   "The lyric ghost that haunts
| our wretched lives with prophecy,
|   As if their words are taunts?"
|
| A beat, then two, she hears it too,
|   but heard is not the word
| An ear would say, this residue
|   inferred through meaning blurred,
|
| "Juh--Jack," She hacks, "Is this a joke?"
|   But jokes are soaked in mirth;
| This line will punch, though falling stroke
|   will bury dead in Earth.      
|
| She asks, "What's that supposed to mean?"
|    He shrugs, "Your guess is mine."
| "Is this--" her stutter opaline,
|    intoned benign, "--a sign?"
|
| A sign, of course, but pointing where? 
|    Aligned to what or who? 
| The human mind, a dull affair,
|   so apt to misconstrue.
|
| The secret sunk in guarded chest
|   of synchronicity
| is found in warps of arcs possessed
|   of eccentricity. 
|
| And even as these words are sewn,
|   and in their heads unstitched,
| she threads the fraying edges shown
|   and falls enthralled bewitched
|
| As lighting up, a dawning norm, 
|   recalled from days of youth,
| there Jill exclaims, "So uniform,
|   I've heard before in truth!
|
| This meter fits a ballad sung 
|   in feet of four and three!"
| And springing up, his hands are wrung,
|   "What's that to you and me?"
|
| "It's hard to say, but what is clear,
|   there's meaning here conceived,"
| Declared in certain words austere,
|   one almost dare believed.
|
| "This useless English Arts degree
|   I never thought to use,
| it's purpose clear, we both agree,
|   was always to deduce
|
| the curse of verse that flirts with us
|   and save us from its worst
| but first I need the tools to suss
|   the course to be reversed,"
|
| Abrupt she stands with coat in hand, 
|   "The library!" She cries, 
| "We need some Keats, that Ginsberg banned,
|   The lessons they advise!"
|
| The lights resurge behind Jack's eyes,
|   as hopeless purged, he rants,
| "Our paths converge and plans revise,
|   but first I need some pants!"

Interlude: Chorus
-----------------

| And now, we pause and ask the point,
|   the one you've surely sought
| as Jack met Jill at story's joint,
|   recalling what was taught:
|
| That hills and crowns will meet in fall 
|   and Jack will crack his head,
| while Jill will follow fast in thrall
|   and wind up very dead. 
| 
| A million monkeys strapped approach
|   the works of bards in time,
| a sonnet thus beyond reproach
|   returned from carriage chime.
|
| A trillion atoms bound through force
|   will likewise fill a void;
| For given time, all lines outsource
|   to stories once enjoyed.
|
| Did verse annoint this story first,
|   or simply find a way
| to organize the parts dispersed 
|   through space's disarray?
|
| Or simpler yet, had Jack just snapped,
|   insane beyond repair?
| The razor tip that Occam tapped
|   declared the latter fair.
|
| The structure seethes, a wreath of webs
|   where meaning sticks to die,
| the mind entwined will find in ebbs
|   the flow that strings the why. 
|   
| This thread is laid through curling maze,
|   convincing paths deceive
| that reason's plan has drawn the ways 
|   but madness hides in weave. 
|
| With morning socks arrayed with boots,
|   rotated masks arranged,
| the tragic interchanged through chutes,
|   with comedy estranged.
