XIII: Floods
------------

| the lifting waves
| of driftwood floods.
|
| the flooding drifts
| of floral wastes.
|
| the flowered wage
| that rivers claim.
|
| on plains that drive
| the veins to sea. 
|
| a ceaseless purge
| through lurid nights. 
|
| the slightest sprout
| is rooted out.
|
| through shooting streams
| that water loots. 
|
| the weeping floods 
| of mountain woods.
