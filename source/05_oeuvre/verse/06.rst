| the city edge, its concrete knife
| divides the Earth, creates a cliff
| the shifting gears engage to dive,
| a morning drive becomes a trek
| along the etching mountainside,
| the tips of which all signals die;
| ascending poles of cable lines,
| the crooked rubber vines that test
| the forest depth infested heights  
| with swarming trails of valleyed years
| much older than the minutes here,
| forgotten since and gone to ground,
| to gravel found upon the paths 
| unravelled round the bend today,
| today a day the years return,
| it turns around to me again,
| repeated now, but far removed
| by twisted roads that have no end,
| where maps pretend to know the way
| through swaying wilds of ancient pine
| inclined on slants of slated shelves,
| that delve the dark of cratered holes
| around reverbing curves that skirt 
| the skids my spinning makes in dirt;
| the thinning miles, the barren miles,
| as humans fade, the tree empires
| expanding spans of secret green,
| and losing me, i find the top,
| the spot we used, the place you said
| you'd always be, but all remains
| decayed, reclaimed, reversed, undone, 
| embedded in the layered lime.
