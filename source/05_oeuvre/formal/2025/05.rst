VI: Let It Simmer
-----------------

| A heart too hot will lack a taste
| refined. Quiet now, simmer down,
| and stew the sauce, or let it baste.
| Yes, let it sit, in flavor drown
| and only then when flame is off,
| you taste a bit, a smidgen pinch;
| Before your hunger dips to trough,
| begin to measure inch by inch
| what boiled over side of thought.
| Distilled to stock, the essence clean
| will cling in drops that drip on pot
| to add to future meals' cuisine.
