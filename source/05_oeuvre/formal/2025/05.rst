VI: Turkey Vultures
-------------------

| the wakes of Turkey Vultures soar
| then perch across the steepled sky.
| they rest on totems tall and pure,
| in silence feathers multiply.
| their talons clutch where crosses meet
| the stolen spear of destined make.
| no heaven sent their wings of fleet,
| no stomach filled will hunger slake.
| the shapes of black in swarming plunged
| upon the carcass freshly brought.
| they feast on sins from gods expunged,
| but left for them as afterthought.
| bewitched to death, returned to Earth,
| from cage released, the specters hunt
| the ones who wear the curse of birth,
| they all must bear the brutal brunt.
