XIV: The Law of Duality
-----------------------

| The world we lived that I once knew
|     (If one could know these fevered dreams)
| I've tried my hand unsticking glue 
|     (These fingers stick to broken seams)
| It sticks to me and sticks to you
|     (Like noose and neck that swing from beams)
| 
| To every thought a thought before
|     (To make of me a puppet string)
| And every point contains much more
|     (But only hollow things can ring)
| While every center holds a core
|     (Yet even empty space can sing)
|
| A million words and more to come
|     (I'd weep to know a single fact)
| These humming beats through syntax thrum
|     (Where waves reflect their heights subtract)
| In hopes a word will angle plumb
|     (Refracted rays in lines contract)
|
| This image pressed through sieve to mold
|     (The words I speak are cracked by heat)
| These holes that craft the shapes to hold
|     (No shapeless things are written neat)
| The world retold in paper fold
|     (What's left of life in crumpled sheet?)
