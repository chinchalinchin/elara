I: ό ποιητα, ἢ πῖθι ἢ ἄπιθι

| I
|
| Awake, Philosopher, rise from these words:
| Unwind in this future the tangle of time,
| pitched behind pupils which shelter your mind,
| a dead language spoken and once lovely sung;
| what was yours only now graces all tongues.
|
| Burrow into my heart, unearth its mantle.
| Tally its hours, each stroke lights a candle;
| Number its sorrows as sureties to borrow,
| spare not my marrow, fallow and frail.
| Whose spirit is this, twisting here twung?
| Breathe in this fire with thy mortal lung.
|
| Circle your sigils with salted symbols loaned,
| and circles will square in this iron-red bone;
| A dream kiss that lingers in copper and crimson,
| a dream dew that swells under circling suns,
| a bud without season, never planted yet grown,
| in the sprout sprung, all things can be shown.
|
| All centers are fire, all orbits are ice,
| all points meet their center with marks imprecise.
| The world is spoked in words of the spoken,
| each whisper a lie of threaded truth unbroken,
| met here now in this slipping handful of tokens
| paid for the price of this thrice-worlded poem.
|
| II
|
| Forgive, Father, the blood of these swords:
| Unbind in this suture the end of all lines,
| stitched in this present the essence divine,
| take what is dull and bless it with sharp;
| plunge this devotion into the ocean of hearts.
|
| Shovel the grave, pack it down with wet earth,
| all things tend towards the lack and the dearth;
| Slumber in barrows the marrows of kings,
| spared not the gavel, hallow and hail.
| Whose mind is this, thinking these thoughts?
| Sleep in the mire which thy heart has wrought.
|
| Birthed in this house, scrubbed down in raw lye,
| so these tears may trace the dead with the die,
| the dead kiss with fingers of copper to scry
| the dead lists that swell in the crimson of lives,
| an end without reason, never sought yet found,
| in the shot sung, all arcs meet the ground.
|
| No fires have ice, no winters can flame,
| son followed father, their center now framed,
| the world is found in the tears that remind him,
| each moment a painting, a song or a hymn,
| met there then in the words etched in stone,
| found then what lacks in the blackening moan.
|
| III
|
| Balance, Lover, these contraries of yours:
| Shine in these eyes the ruptures of life,
| witched into worlds upon the blade of a knife;
| all wagers distill down to one move unproven,
| to find you again in this web-woven movement.
|
| Dance in the night, when the music is sundered,
| count not the stars that belong to the numbers.
| We find in this time the rhymes of our kind,
| spared not the sickle, those sickly or hale.
| Whose voice is this, singing these songs?
| Laugh with the liar whose heart sings along.
|
| Uncross your words of their fire-forged knots,
| and each will unlatch the thatches of thought:
| The dread kiss that coppers balance with nought,
| the dread song that cradles the crimson in crofts,
| a vow without treason, never spoken yet shown,
| by words of wordless wonder, such things can be grown.
|
| All fires are embers, all ashes are white,
| to find is to lose the center in flight.
| The world found in threads that bind always thus,
| Each fiber of moment knotted deftly in truss,
| take hand and guide as though only you that I trust.
| Do what we will to balance world's thrust.
