V: The Curse of Rain
--------------------

| The rainy days, so slandered, weep
| as haughty summer lovers lay
| and mock the sky with lazy sleep,
| while clouds so white with dreams of gray,
| with sun they soak and whirling sweep
| in hidden furies' winded spray.
|
| Each time it rains, the rivers splay,
| and surge with purging currents swift,
| what lays on shore is swept away
| through undertow then set adrift
| to reach again where edge gives way
| to core laid bare through ancient rift.
|
| The heat was shaped with holy bliss,
| while cold finds form in shattered fall,
| the tracks of arcs that never miss,
| the purpose found in roaring squall,
| to hurl in spite of stolen kiss,
| to seed with life this earthen sprawl.
|
| No forest sprite nor sun born sprout,
| can know the course of water's fate,
| to craft and make then cease the drought,
| and hear its name with venom hate
| in curses made by summer's clout,
| and so it cries at heaven's gate.
