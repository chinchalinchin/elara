XI: Gravity
-----------

| The mind, it breaks, and falls to parts.
| As father died, he spoke in tongues
| of shifting walls and gravity
| that sideways pulled the world to parts. 
|
| The mind, it shakes, and all departs.
| As mother lost her lonely thoughts
| she spoke to walls, soliloquy
| that inward rolled as world departs.
|
| The mind, it's fakeness poisons hearts.
| As nightshade petals float to floors
| by walls that seep humanity,
| the crumbled worlds of poisoned hearts. 
| 
| The mind, it wakes, in fits and starts.
| As thoughts now lay me down to sleep
| the walls will shift and speak to me
| that upside down my ending starts.
