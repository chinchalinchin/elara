IX: Silver Gifts
----------------

| Of silver gifts that might inspire
|   What burns in me in red,
| The perfect one I sought through mire
|   To say the words unsaid.
|
| A coin from mint, with shine and glint,
|   Will catch the eye like you.
| But pockets empty money spent
|   While you in time accrue.
|
| A spoon or fork, a candlestick,
|   Much closer still to life,
| These things, like you, are what we pick
|   In times of joy or strife.
|
| A ring is fine, but circles lack
|   Geometry divine.
| What shapes are made to trace and track
|   What forms around you twine?
|
| Of silver gifts but one remains:
|   A mirror held to face.
| For only there in glass contains
|   What sets my heart apace.
