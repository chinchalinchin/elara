XII: Generations of Gravity
---------------------------

| The mind, it breaks, and falls to parts.
| As father died, he spoke in tongues
| Of shifting walls and gravity
| That sideways pulled the world to parts. 
|
| The mind, it shakes, and all departs.
| As mother lost her lonely thoughts
| She spoke to walls, soliloquy
| That inward rolled as world departs.
|
| The mind, it fakes, and poisons hearts.
| As nightshade petals float to floors
| By walls that seep humanity,
| That crumble worlds of poisoned hearts. 
| 
| The mind, it wakes, in fits and starts.
| As thoughts now lay me down to sleep
| The walls will shift and speak to me
| That upside down my ending starts.
