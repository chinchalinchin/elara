XII: The Origin of Lies
-----------------------

| Oh, Ila, don't be weeping,
|    my dear, you misconstrue;
| The sun is only sleeping
|    before it rises new.
|
| I'll wait with you til morning,
|    and tell you of the stars,
| the memories adorning
|    the empty night with scars. 
|
| This love that's learned by lacking,
|    whose vastness has no chart,
| in silent orbits tracking
|    the shaping of your heart. 
|
| Please trust that nothing passes,
|    we only change our form.
| Your tears transmute to gasses 
|    when sun returns to warm.
|
| Child, listen, though you're growing,
|    some things cannot be known
| until you've grown up knowing
|    out here you're all alone.
|
| I'll be with you forever,
|    these words will be a lie.
| If I could but this deliver:
|    To live until you die.
|
| So while you're small, keep holding
|    my hand as though it soothes,
| The world will keep unfolding
|   each wrinkle that it smoothes.
|
| Believe me when I'm saying:
|    Oh, Ila, darling dear,
| No matter what I'm staying,
|    I'll always be right here.
