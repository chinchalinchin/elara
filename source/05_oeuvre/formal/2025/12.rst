XIII: Libations
---------------

| this old besotted drink of mine
|    with diamond eyes of ice,
| it burns the throat and tastes of pine,
|    my loathsome, lonely vice.
|
| it lingers sweet as to entice
|    these lips to part for you.
| these nights accrue an awful price
|    that wakes up overdue.
|
| yet lipstick marks on crystal grew
|    as vertigo took hold. 
| we stumbled heedless, flowing through
|    our tongues of amber gold. 
|
| too late, this thirst is uncontrolled;
|     we fall in love once more.
| our words are spilled a hundredfold
|     as once again we swore:
|
| i'll never leave, not anymore,
|     you're all i'll ever need.
| so take a drink, another pour
|     and watch the world recede.
