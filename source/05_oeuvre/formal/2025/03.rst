IV: Bird 
--------

| To say what's meant without the word,
| Oh poetry, relent wherein
| I yield to you all things deferred,
| In baptism, repent my sin.
|
| I found a bird, that sings so soft,
| Her song aloft in heart by choice.
| To field of hers I pass so oft
| To sit in grass and drink her voice.
|
| With chirping dive she plunged so deep
| And pierced the weary veil that hides
| The ghosts of dreams that haunt my sleep;
| She sang such hopeful lullabies.
|
| Oh bird, oh bird, with glee you sing,
| If you could know the depths of dark
| That shadows cast in offering,
| Would song still burst from breast in lark?
