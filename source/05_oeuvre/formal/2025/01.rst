II: Kingdoms
------------

| Two children crossed an earthen bridge
| from level lawns to forests wild
| along the rivered arc descending ridge.
| With dirty hands, they sang and smiled.
| their charted map from zippered packs
| now in branches espied its target
| as clearing yields to lily blacks
| their kingdom's fresh air market.
| Lord and lady honorary, cheeked blush,
| sat upon thrones of woven grass,
| coronated by chirping choir thrush;
| a falling grain in hourglass. 
|
| On a maiden morning moments hence,
| they meet again upon the autumn passing,
| where from heart's removed pretense
| on tender lips, farewell's final massing.
| Lily lyrics whisper sing from ground
| reminders of their childish notions;
| World departed, their lives are found
| separate by spanning roads and oceans.
|
| In the city, their trains diverge,
| through tunnels tracked by wagered hours;
| Iron rails through hearts do purge
| their aged minds of lily flowers.
| Winter drifts over concrete streets,
| in the thrush's snow sad song
| delivered them in voice downbeat
| the final dirge of life prolonged.
| In the cold, their dream dissolved
| with the clock's incessant ticking.
| Falling strokes of time resolved;
| they follow home a casket's wicking,
| Returned again to a lilting lily field
| where once royals played for a day;
| With new hearts scored and peeled
| in the funerary cloud of gray,
| in the clearing, coffins buried,
| their eyes met in solitary gaze.
|
| In dirt developed their earthen walls,
| roofed the sky to room above,
| where lord and lady clothed in shawls
| sing the thrushs' songed love.
