VII: Silver Gifts
-----------------

| Of silver gifts that might inspire
|   what burns in me in red,
| the perfect one I sought through mire
|   to say the words unsaid.
|
| A coin from mint, with shine and glint,
|   will catch the eye like you.
| but pockets empty money spent
|   while you in time accrue.
|
| A spoon or fork, a candlestick,
|   much closer still to life,
| these things, like you, are what we pick
|   in times of joy or strife.
|
| A ring is fine, but circles lack
|   geometry divine.
| What shapes are made to trace and track
|   what forms around you twine?
|
| Of silver gifts but one remains:
|   a mirror held to face.
| For only there in glass contains
|   what sets my heart apace.
