XVI: A Series of Reflections
-----------------------------

| sagas!
|
| level after level,
| the noon pets a pup.
| tenet after tenet,
| a flow step to wolf.
|
| deified!
|
| the animal parts,
| the lamina strap,
| the devil paws,
| through swap it lived.
|
| refer!
|
| a peep or deed,
| the tips that it spat,
| the taps that it spit,
| the pals to slap.
| 
| rotor!
|
| lever with revel! 
| spin the nips!
| a spool of loops!
|
| plug the eye!
| gulp the gag!
|
| deliver reviled
| aibohphobia!
|
| a tool we loot,
| when maps are spam.
|
| on serif peels 
| sleep fires, no?

.. | Often

.. | Often

.. | Always
