I: River Rats
-------------

| On river shore the poor in tents will store
|    their nightly weeping sore.
| Above and north, the city steeples meet
| To speak in sermons ever incomplete
|     for sheep they so ignore.
|
| They fight with roar, yet beaten, kiss through gore;
| Their barrel fire northward dreams of more,
| The city lights too far a source of heat
|    For life on river shore.
|
| In winter months they paint on skin a whore,
| And every one despite what silence swore.
|     These cycles now repeat
|     While steeples chime upbeat.
| A yearly war for land they all abhor:
|     Their home on river shore.
