III: Depths
-----------

| The delicate kiss
| of stillness
| on fingertips.
|
| I linger
| on the precipice
| of surface 
| tension.
| 
| Pallid brine
| eagerly lapping 
| with organic clarity.
|
| An instant 
| before
| the sightless 
| plunge.
| 
| The delirium
| of forgotten
| beginnings. 
| 
| The water
| remembers
| my blood.
