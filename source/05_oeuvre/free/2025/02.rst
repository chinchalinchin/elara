III: Imaginary Vessels
----------------------

| oh name of names, 
| break me into pieces.
| scatter me across these shores.
| let me linger in the tides,
| in the motion of the waves.
|
| the infinite horizon
| condenses into 
| licks of white foam
| on sparkling beaches.
| 
| shatter me into glass,
| slivered lunar shards.
| cast me into the deep
| to curve like lightning 
| across the geometry of the sea.
| 
| i am a million currents,
| the invisible riptide.
| every moment is an ebb
| within the flowing whole.
|  
| the cruel logic of time
| flows through the 
| phases of the moon.
| let me roar and hiss 
| through lightless nights
| as the tidal ages pass. 
| 
| though my bones are Earth,
| my blood was made from water
| and when my flesh is ground again,
| to the ocean i shall return.
|
| from nothing we are shaped;
| every image is a metaphor
| for the void inside.
| 
| our hearts are imaginary,
| like the shape of water
| that fills every vessel.
