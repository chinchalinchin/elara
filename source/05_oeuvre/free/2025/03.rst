IV: Burning Bush
-----------------

| the pressure thrum of altitudes,
| the drumming beat in ears.
|
| as weary flesh ascends the face
| to summit hidden groves.
|
| where feathertips unseen but heard
| sigh through fluttered leaves.
|
| i sit cross-legged, cliffside hung
| above the place where strangers roam.
| 
| it's tiny, grey, and so 
| contained
| in concrete joints of streets.
|
| like bones that cage a 
| flame
| and hold it deep in valley ribs. 
|
| each measured breath of mountain light
| lacks the air a city breathes. 
|
| it leaves me like a smoking wick
| that curls in syrupy sun.
| 
| extinguished and exhaled
| in secret sacrifice.
