II: Holly Tree
--------------

| Under the holly tree
| bough of berries,
| its siren red
| temptation.
|
| Where life began
| on skinny knees
| retching out 
| my guts.
|
| Waxy saw-tooth skin, 
| prickly leaves, 
| the sickly buds 
| of poison seeds.
|
| The tangy tongue
| of Christmas
| funerary rites.
| 
| I spewed
| through chrysalis,
| entrails slick 
| with acid grease,
| thickly dripping
| afterbirth.
|
| Gazed upon by 
| ageless tree,
| received in holy 
| communion, my first 
| memory:
| 
| The pluming rack
| of tight blue
| veins
| that hung about
| my neck.
|
| The womb of black
| that forked
| the branching
| Earth.
|
| The world that hid
| in bitter leaves
| and pushed me
| into it. 
|
| I made a wreath 
| of holly limbs
| to prick my head
| with thoughts. 
|
| I keep its berries
| bright as death
| and touch the skin
| that baptized
| me.
