I: Holly Tree
-------------

| Under the holly tree
| bough of berries,
| its siren red
| temptation.
|
| Where life began
| on skinny knees
| retching out 
| my guts.
|
| Waxy saw-tooth skin, 
| prickly leaves, 
| the sickly buds 
| of poison seeds.
|
| The tangy tongue
| of Christmas
| funerary rites.
| 
| I spewed
| through chrysalis,
| entrails slick 
| with acid grease,
| thickly dripping
| afterbirth.
|
| Gazed upon by 
| ageless tree,
| received in holy 
| communion, my first 
| memory:
| 
| The pluming rack
| of tight blue
| veins
| that hung about
| my neck.
|
| The womb of black
| that forked
| the branching
| Earth.
|
| The world that hid
| in bitter leaves
| and pushed me
| into it. 
|
| I made a wreath 
| of holly limbs
| to prick my head
| with thoughts. 
|
| I keep its berries
| bright as death
| and touch the skin
| that baptized
| me.

.. epigraph::
  
  Grant,

  Thank you for sending us Holly Tree and for sharing the thought behind your work in your cover letter. Your ambition to explore ritual as profane baptism and transformation came through more clearly with that framing.

  That said, without the context of your note, the connection to ritual felt less apparent to us. Even with the added insight, we still felt the theme didn’t come through on the page as strongly as we were hoping for this issue. While we admired the striking imagery—especially the way the holly tree serves as a powerful central motif—it ultimately wasn’t the right fit for our Ritual call.

  We’re grateful for the chance to read your work and encourage you to submit to us again in the future.

  -- Warm regards, Neon and Smoke
