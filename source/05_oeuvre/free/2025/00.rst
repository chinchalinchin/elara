--------
I: Sight
--------

| the true nature 
| of sight 
| seen through closed eyes
| in dark 
| round rooms 
| with
| no corners to hang
| the 
| cloth of thought;
|
| endless flicker
| through
| inner pictures
| of 
| outer nothing
| met in perfect 
| equilibrium
| stabilized in secret
| through the muted 
| dark. 
|
| then
|
| the flower sprouts 
| in acid eyes,
| through hidden struts
| the world supplies. 
|
| in flashing spiral
| the formless chaos
| of flailing chiral
| tentacles
| semantic suction cup
| receptacles
| frantic for their lack
|
| then 
| 
| black again
| without a rhyme
| just empty facts
|       (that flow through time...
|        a voice in back replies...)
| the hollow truth.
