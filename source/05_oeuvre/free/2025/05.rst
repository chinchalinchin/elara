VI: Millenial Melodies
----------------------

| the slow motion
| lives of trees
| in the forest deep.
| empires of pine
| wage ancient wars
| against city-states of oak.
| an insurgency of maple
| hides in their midst,
| gathering at their trunks,
| the nascent rebellion
| that unwinds over centuries.
|
| morning dew soaks 
| the soft slick bark
| of the frozen sentinels
| and paints with strokes
| measured in years
| the green of pungent
| moldy spores.
|
| here a pile of stones,
| millenia old,
| hewn from a mountain.
| the jagged edges of
| its primordial eruption
| softened by quiet eons,
| now draped with pagan cloaks
| of forest magic,
| the altars of secret
| divinations,
| pooling with the blood
| of moss. 
|
| the harmonic revolutions 
| of parallel life, 
| the millenial melodies
| converging into a chorus
| of now.
