III: Turns
----------

| now rushing down the interstate in flight
| i flee in haste a town as rudders plow
| 
| i ply the roads and tune the bass to flow
| the slowing flats of blooming notes to cry
| 
| the tires gnaw the looming paths that grow
| i slowly crack the window next and croon
| 
| i climb the western thinning backs of slopes
| then slide through tracks of whooshing timber lines
|
| the slumbered time of oozing treks that guide
| i drive in tracts that bruise the slurried brine 
|
| i pine for pure and drowsy pacts derived
| to thrive in lacks each prowling turn defines
