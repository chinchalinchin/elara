II: Rails
---------

| i yearn for motion's pull and thrust
| the thunder pulse of engine churn
| 
| the pensive burn of ember coals
| i coax the sentry furnace west
| 
| i press the pure and tempered coke
| the poker tamps the pyre nest
| 
| the piled flame that prods the spokes
| i smoke through stops and tile plains
| 
| i'm riding tracks to mountaintops
| from ground to tip that cracks the sky
| 
| the circles arc around the trails
| i'm bound to rails that skirt my heart
