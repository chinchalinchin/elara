Objects of Remembrance
----------------------

Photographs
-----------

| A photograph of strangers' joy
| atop the garbage, torn in half.
| though lost, these ghosts in gloss deploy
|   a photograph. 
|
| Imagine tears that joyous laugh,
| the Autumn gowns and corduroy,
| a wedding banquet monograph.
|
| With age then mixed precise alloy
| from parts romance and epitaph,
| til future hands at last destroy
|   a photograph.

Graffitied Walls
----------------

| Graffitied walls of yearly bloom
| with vagrant spray of aerosols;
| The vapors fume, condense and groom
|   graffitied walls. 
|
| The artists follow protocols:
| the lover's name, the prophet's doom,
| the epigraphs of homeless sprawls.
|
| The rarer buds of sweet perfume
| are hidden deep in alley malls
| where flowered faces sprung consume
|   graffitied walls. 

Fragrant Air
------------

| The fragrant air which wavers here
| in heat like harps of golden hair
| that sweep their shoulder length and clear
|   the fragrant air.
|
| The lily sermons whisper where
| I heard your blood through skin by ear,
| a moment made in silent stare. 
|
| The scent remains, you disappear,
| as wind now speaks your name in prayer,
| in razor gusts that whip and shear
|   the fragrant air.
| 

Fading Ink
----------

| In fading ink, her fine details
| like curly cues and shades of pink,
| the shadowed lines that leak through trails
|   in fading ink.
|
| A paper mind she wrote to think, 
| so words replace what breath inhales
| and find my thoughts with hers in sync. 
|
| In letters light as chapel veils,
| I watch our dance as bodies sink,
| a final gasp of life exhales 
|   in fading ink.
|

Vinyl Seats
-----------

| The vinyl seats of classic cars,
| the plastic smell their thread secretes
| as cherry burn on cover mars 
|   the vinyl seats.
|
| When Father stooped to sew the sheets,
| his needles stacked in columned jars,
| his fingers folded rows of pleats.
|
| My fingers trace the wells of scars
| as driving down the city streets
| my careless dropped reminder chars
|   the vinyl seats.
