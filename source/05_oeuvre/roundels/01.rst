Dinner Wine
-----------

| The dinner wine of nervous dates
| once grew upon a Summer vine.
| The Autumn wind now hushed awaits
|       the dinner wine. 
|
| Beneath the Winter's pure moonshine,
| our words distill like concentrates 
| til fingers find yours under mine. 
|
| A taste of Spring now circulates 
| as starry arcs began decline,
| the final drop that dedicates 
|       the dinner wine.
