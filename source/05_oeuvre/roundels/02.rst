Little Sprout
-------------

| Oh, little sprout, the forest sleeps
| in arid ground now cursed by drought.
| Across the land, the desert sweeps,
|       oh, little sprout. 
| 
| Your boldness lacks a water spout
| but hidden root in darkness steeps
| the moisture buried deep in doubt. 
|
| The dream of Spring nobody keeps 
| ascends in stems so small and stout 
| when mourning sky beholding weeps,
|       oh, little sprout.
