Names

if the days had no names, then nothing would ever change. time would stand still. the sun would be stationary in the sky. all things are timeless. change is only measured by difference and if there is no difference, then there is no change. there is no change. invent a name and invoke a spell. measure words, in metered feet or sonic scapes of sound. the words that change shapes across the page are illusion, an imposition, an inducement. they lead thoughts like leashed animals. the staked rope of form, self contained circumferences. constraints trace finite circles, but space is infinite lines. eliminate the stake, remove the constraint, abandon all hope of completion, the simple sweet knowledge that all paths lead back home, that you end where you start, that nothing ever changes.
