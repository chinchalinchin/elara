Roots
-----

let us talk of roots, the hidden networks, downward grown. let us trace the worming threads through the soft earth. let us speak of the sist. the cyst that spreads like wildflower weeds. peel back the layers, shuck the stems, discard the declension. press and pin the velvet petals of chaos to glass displays. 

the ex-sist: existence, the external, the exoskeleton, the explicated. 

the sub-sist: subsistence, the subordinate, the subterranean, the substantial. 

the in-sist: insistence, the internal, the induction, the intention. 

persist in this assistance, resist inconsistence. dig up the unwieldy garden, the duplicitous multiplicity that disguises its buried singularity. extract the hidden structure of roots. remove the modalities, that coarse skin accumulated in sunlight. distill the bark through steam and collect the condensate, the oily residue of abstraction. an ancient potion, a cistern of sistere, the stare of eons.
