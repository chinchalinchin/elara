Notes on the Aspects of Language
--------------------------------

I - Wildflower
--------------

language is a wildflower. with roots of hidden networks, downward grown. it slithers through soft dirt like a knot of worms. it spreads unseen like weeds to fill every crack and crevice, a vital pressure whose only valve is the spray of green across the dead earth. 

dig up the unwieldy garden, the duplicitous multiplicity that disguises its buried singularity. extract the hidden structure of roots. prune the varieties, the divergent species grown from a single seed, reared and flowered by the errancy of the sun and rain. peel back the layers, shuck the stalks, discard the fibrous shell. press and pin the velvet petals to glass displays:

exist: the extravagant exterior. the exoskeleton of expressions that explore the exotic external.

subsist: the submerged substance. the subterranean substrate subliminally subsumed into subordination. 

insist: the inciting incursion. the internal incandescence that incinerates incoherence through induction. 

assist: the ascendant aspect. the aspiration of asonant assets assimilating astonishment through associative assertions.

consist: the concealed container. the contours of contradiction that conceit confers through conceivable contextualizations.

persist: the perennial perception. the perfect performance of percussion percolating through perilious perimeters.

the prodigial brood, dispersed through the fields, interbreeding and yielding to the whims of the climate. harvet the phylum. crush the leaves. mix them together. distill the material through steam and collect the condensate, the oily residue of abstraction. an ancient potion, a cistern of sistere, the stare of eons.

II - Songbird
-------------

language is a songbird. it suffuses the world with overlapping choruses of alien tongues. a symphony of location, of triangulating echoes, the smooth superposition of sound scapes the muses fuse into space. 

there is grammar in the noise.

the hiss of geese, hysterical and histrionic, coiling in serpentine necks. the straight edge of demarcation, the frantic flapping announcement of occupation. a screech taht shears a circumference and clears the ground.

the quaking curiosity of dottering ducks, landing in fat splashes. the goofy cousins of geese hanging upside down like inverted buoys, their waggling feet kicking helpless with the overwhelming desire for the plunge. the playful fingers of the flock, the rowdy laughter of the crowd. 

the rapid radar rhythm of circling sparrows, flickering fast in flight, their sudden movements coordinated in spastic weaves like weapons of war engaged in life-or-death combat. the dragnet signal of fleets traversing an ocean of sky, sentries in motion, a hive mind.

the mournful melodies of smitth thrush, their heartsick dirges lilting like pyres. the ever-flowing ashes of poetry on the wind. the melancholy that drifts in cooling embers, to blanket the earth in fertile white soot.

the lazy resigned cooing of pigeons waddling across the pavement. the exasperation of experience, the way musics dispels into sighs with age. the elegance of growing old and fading into oblivion, dissolving in white noise.

.. III - Formal
.. ------------
.. 
.. language is dance. it is the meaning of motion not found in movement. 
..
.. the flowing meter often heard aligns through time with stress. 
.. 
.. it resides in the measured waltz of steps. in the ebbs that follow the flow that leads. 
.. 
.. the way words weigh different in sequence
.. in sequence the different way words weigh
.. the different way words in sequence weigh 

.. each life lives in words a hundred different lives.
