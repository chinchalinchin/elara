I: Floods
---------

| the lifting waves
| of driftwood floods
|
| the flooding drifts
| of floral wastes
|
| a flowered wage
| that rivers claim
|
| on plains that drive
| the veins to sea 
|
| a ceaseless purge
| through slurried nights 
|
| the slightest sprout
| is rooted out
|
| through shooting streams
| that water loots 
|
| the slaughter lurks
| below riptides
|
| but tides recede
| with grating speed
| 
| and petal graves 
| in gravel pits
|
| unravel green
| with dreams of Spring
