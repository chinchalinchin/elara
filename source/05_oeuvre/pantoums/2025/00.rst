I: LeAnna's Pantoum
-------------------

| These spun beginnings make our end,
| Oh, LeAnna, of Anna's Leigh,
| When you come with grin and play pretend
| The past is what we both agree.
|
| Oh, LeAnna, of Anna's Leigh,
| Despite the many faults of mine,
| The past is what we both agree
| Once marks are made on dotted line.
|
| Despite the many faults of mine,
| I'll try to love you just the same;
| Once marks are made on dotted line
| There's no one left but you to blame.
|
| I'll try to love you just the same;
| These spun beginnings make our end.
| There's no one left but you to blame,
| When you come with grin and play pretend.
