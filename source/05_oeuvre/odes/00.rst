Ode to Death 
------------

| if i am doomed to die, to fade away,
| then let the Summer dig for me a grave
| so deep beneath her depths of supple clay
| to reach the slate my roots in dying crave,
| so seasons pass and cast 
|   my bone to hidden stone
|     through layers moistened brown,
| the loam of ages past
|   from gilded breezes blown
|     that ancient storms brought down.
| 
| in time, my stones will seep through Autumn seams,
| the teeth of grinding Earth that gnash the dead,
| returning flesh to banks of violent streams
| where fallen leaves revive in bloody red 
| remaining veins encased
|   in amber pebble tombs,
|     each waiting turns to die,
| depart this world erased
|   and face the end that looms
|     in dust of covered sky. 
|
| so keep these shards on sheltered shores and guard
| the song of raving larks and restless gaze;
| let nothing chance upon my resting yard
| as sorrow sheds its form, at last, decays;
| i have no edge to skip 
|   but only weight to sink,
|     so rising tides return
| in floods the currents whip
|   to Winter's very brink,
|     my stirring final churn.
|
| and when my ripples flatten back to glass
| remember once again the scent of Spring, 
| perfumed with wasted youth and sassafras,
| regret dissolved to tempest underwing,
| ascending cloudless heights 
|   through heaven's darkest spheres,
|     diluting down to air,
| returning now as lights,
|   this starry nest appears
|     to mark my vast despair.
