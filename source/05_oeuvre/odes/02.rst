Ode to Upholstery
-----------------

| the Sunday mornings hang in clouds of smoke
| above my head where thoughts of you reside
| recalling times my clumsy fingers broke
| some stitch or knit your fingers deftly tied,
| or when you'd measure out your thread
|       to fix the errors made
|           and sew it back anew,
| i knew when watching as you spread
|       the fiber that i frayed,
|           i never would be you.
|
| a box of decades stored in bobbin spools
| unwind within my open palm their loops,
| reversing ages into circled pools;
| a single tangled knot erupts and droops,
| undone so quick and dripping thick
|       through winding yards of years
|           you spun around the drum
| before the plunging needle prick,
|       this moment reappears
|           along the lengths i thumb.
|
| what cluttered racks of vinyl rolls to stack
| against the walls where once you puffed your pipe,
| the only imitation i could crack
| now burning in my teeth, a cherry ripe
| as molten metal cast in molds
|       before the water chills
|           and shapes the studs with steam
| to snaps you press through sheets and folds
|       of layered woven twills,
|           to hide the lonely seam.
|
| the intersecting threads of me through strands
| of silken plumes, they needle past my lips
| from dying gears that spin beneath your hands
| to weave the pattern drawn by fingertips
| upon the fabric draping down
|       in wrinkled folds of cloth
|           unrolled in hazy rooms,
| like ones you sketched with focused frown
|       and cut to clear the swath
|           of me that burns and fumes.
|
| these empty rooms of tools you left behind,
| as if some day i'd understand their use,
| instead infected specks of rust i grind
| with oiled stones on spinning spokes that loose 
| eroded flakes of showered flames
|       and spray the ground with red,
|           the dust of wasted time,
| each careful pass of sparks reclaims
|       the last remains you shed, 
|           the gleam that hides in grime.
