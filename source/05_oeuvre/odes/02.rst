Ode to the Absent
-----------------

| the Sunday mornings hang in clouds of smoke
| above my head where thoughts of you reside
| recalling times my clumsy fingers broke
| some stitch or knot your fingers deftly tied,
| or when you'd measure out your thread
|    to fix the errors made
|        and sew it back anew,
| i knew when watching as you spread
|    the fiber that i frayed,
|        i never would be you.
|
| what cluttered racks of vinyl rolls to stack
| against the walls where once you puffed your pipe,
| the only imitation i could crack
| now burning in my teeth, a cherry ripe
| as molten metal cast in molds
|    before the water chills
|        and shapes the studs with steam
| to snaps you press through sheets and folds
|    of layered woven twills,
|        to hide the lonely seam.
|
| the intersecting threads of me through strands
| of silken plumes, they needle past my lips
| from dying gears that spin beneath your hands
| and weave the pattern drawn by fingertips
| upon the fabric draping down
|    in wrinkled folds of cloth
|        unrolled in hazy rooms,
| the one you sketched with focused frown
|    and cut to clear the swath
|        of me that burns and fumes.
|
| these empty rooms of tools you left behind,
| as if one day i'd understand their use,
| instead infected specks of rust i grind
| with oiled stones on spinning spokes that loose 
| eroded flakes of showered flames
|    and spray the ground with red,
|        the dust of wasted time,
| each careful pass of sparks reclaims
|    the last remains you shed, 
|        the gleam that hides in grime.
