I: An Ode For The Seasons
-------------------------

| if i am doomed to die, to fade away,
| then let the Summer dig for me a grave,
| so deep beneath her depths of supple clay
| to layered slate my dying roots now crave,
| as seasons pass and cast 
| my bone to hidden stone
| of black that holds the brown,
| the loam of ages past
| that glides on breezes blown
| until by storm brought down.
| 
| in time, my stones will seep through Autumn seams
| of teeth of grinding Earth that gnash the dead,
| returning flesh to banks of violent streams
| where fallen leaves revive in bloody red 
| remaining veins encased
| in amber pebble tombs 
| that wait in turn to die,
| depart this world erased
| and face the end that looms
| in dust that coats the sky. 
|
| so keep these shards on sheltered shores and guard
| the song of roaming larks and searching gaze;
| let nothing chance upon my resting yard
| as sorrow sheds its form, at last decays;
| i have no edge to skip 
| but only weight to sink
| so rising tides return
| in floods the currents whip
| to Winter's very brink
| around my final churn.
