Your Hand
---------

| My overflowing palm retains your hand,
| my soundless searching grip constrains your hand.
|
| Campaigns were waged behind our dinner plates
| so in my weakened state now reigns your hand. 
|
| Champagne on lips recalls our lightning strike, 
| its faded charge at least sustains your hand.
|
| Your face betrays unknown terrains of thought,
| I ask, what other vision gains your hand?
|
| Today's performance wanes around your eyes,
| the last remaining fragment feigns your hand.
|
| Though yesterday what we ingrained was real,
| it's only habit now that trains your hand. 
|
| Our anthem drains its notes on evening wind,
| not even beating rhythm reins your hand. 
|
| The grain of folds within your clenching fist 
| reveals the tangled web that veins your hand.
|
| My fingers trace disdain beneath a strand
| of silver thread. What bracelet chains your hand? 
|
| Bewitched, your straining wrist displays a charm, 
| another's secret heart ordains your hand.
