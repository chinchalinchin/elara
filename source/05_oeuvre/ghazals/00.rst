Your Hand
---------

| My overflowing palm contains your hand,
| my soundless searching eye constrains your hand.
|
| Today's performance wanes around your face,
| a trace remaining pretense feigns your hand.
|
| While yesterday what we ordained was real,
| it's only habit now restrains your hand. 
|
| My fingers trace your veins beneath a strand
| of silver thread. A bracelet chains your hand.
