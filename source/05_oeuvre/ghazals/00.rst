Your Hand
---------

| My overflowing palm contains your hand,
| my soundless searching grip constrains your hand.
|
| Champagne on lips recalls electric nights, 
| their fading charge atleast sustains your hand.
|
| Today's performance wanes around your eyes,
| a trace remain of pretense feigns your hand.
|
| While yesterday what we ingrained was real,
| it's only habit now restrains your hand. 
|
| My fingers trace your veins beneath a strand
| of silver thread, a bracelet chains your hand.
| 
| Returned like ranging echoes to their source, 
| the ghost of music played ordains your hand. 
|
| Refrains of failures play their notes of me, 
| the medley of that man profanes your hand.
|
| Your face betrays unknown terrains of thought,
| I ask, what other vision gains your hand?
|
| Please grant me this: a blameless moment more
| where touching me no longer stains your hand. 

- September 2025


.. | and soon my hand no longer stains your hand. 
.. | tonight I'll soak with tears what stains your hand. 

.. | this grant you gave to hold 
.. | explains your hand?

.. |
.. | no matter what, your hand remains your hand.

.. | detains your hand.
.. | entertains your hand.
.. | maintains your hand.
.. | obtains your hand. 
.. | regains your hand.
.. | retains your hand.
.. | retrains your hand.
.. | sprains your hand.
.. | stains your hand.
