------------
I: Cathedral
------------

| A church atop a steepled hill,
| Foundation layers ages old,
| Remains in spirit standing still.
| 
| The shattered stains on window sill,
| With marble halls of lichen mold,
| A church atop a steepled hill.
|
| Decrepit pews of souls fulfill
| What congregation left untold,
| Remains in spirit standing still.
|
| The circled streets possess no will
| Except the signs that staked and sold
| A church atop a steepled hill.
|
| But tower high such pointed skill,
| Through silken skies of glittered gold,
| Remains in spirit standing still.
|
| Ignore the wind, the biting chill,
| And cast your final gaze, behold:
| A church atop a steepled hill 
| Remains in spirit standing still.
