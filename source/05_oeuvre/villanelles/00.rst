Cathedral

| A church atop a steepled hill,
| foundation layers ages old,
| remains in spirit standing still.
| 
| The shattered stains on window sill,
| with marble halls of lichen mold,
| a church atop a steepled hill.
|
| Decrepit pews of souls fulfill
| what congregation left untold,
| remains in spirit standing still.
|
| The circled streets possess no will
| except the signs that staked and sold
| a church atop a steepled hill.
|
| But tower high such pointed skill,
| through silken skies of glittered gold,
| remains in spirit standing still.
|
| Ignore the wind, the biting chill,
| and cast your final gaze, behold:
| A church atop a steepled hill 
| remains in spirit standing still.
