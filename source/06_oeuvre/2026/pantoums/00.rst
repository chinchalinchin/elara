| the cold ascends like empires drawn from ice,
| the mist dissolved to steam escaping lips
| with thoughts that doom, but even still entice.

| The cold ascends like empires drawn from ice
| as wind returns a harbour street to sleet
| with thoughts that doom, but even still entice
| the withered bloom in cycles to repeat.

| As wind returns a harbour street to sleet,
| I think upon the sailor lost at sea,
| the withered bloom in cycles to repeat 
| the words he said in promises to me.
