The Gap
-------

| the trees are cleaved like butchered heads
| then staked along the path to mark
| forgotten children down in graves
| of shallow dirt atop the stone
| where sand condensed from flooded silt
| and drowned as silent years went past
| to leave at last an altar flat
| on mountain edge near where i sat
| as streams below, they flowed and cut
| a gorge between the heights to form
| the slated stairs ascending shelves
| to summit barrows buried deep
| beneath the blinding sun that burns
| the candled ice adorning shrines
| decayed through time, reborn too late
| in lichen stains that spread in webs,
| the overlapping claims of death.
