Falling Leaves
--------------

| the autumn bleeds its fallen leaves,
| enthralling me with awful dreams
| of auburn weaves my fingers clasped.
| 
| the wraiths of wind that rasp in gales,
| their gasping veils the ghastly shapes
| of lingered lines the gusts unwind.
| 
| as afterglows of neon fleece
| ablaze between the slowing clouds
| begin their final breath of light.
| 
| the setting world ignores the sun,
| its traces spun through swirling dark
| in arcs that whisper what's begun.
|
| the silent dance of leaves through black, 
| the lacks you left through wide expanse,
| that day you laughed and said to me:
|
| embrace the fading spans of grace,
| this place that wanes within the shade.
| as fallen leaves arrayed your face.
