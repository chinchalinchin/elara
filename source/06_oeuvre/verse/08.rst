Falling Leaves
--------------

| the autumn bleeds its fallen leaves,
| enthralling me with awful dreams
| of auburn weaves my fingers clasp.
| 
| the rasping wind inhaled through gales
| my gasp unveils as shapes remain 
| in lingered lines the breeze unwinds.
| 
| an afterglow of neon fleece
| ablaze between the blowing clouds,
| the final breath before the night.
| 
| become the moment caught between
| the nothing and the everything,
| the falling leaves and all they bring.
