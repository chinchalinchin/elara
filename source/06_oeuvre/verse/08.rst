Falling Leaves
--------------

| the autumn bleeds its fallen leaves,
| enthralling me with awful dreams
| of auburn weaves my fingers clasped.
| 
| the rasping wind inhaled through gales
| as gasp unveils what shapes remain 
| in lingered lines the gusts unwind.
| 
| an afterglow of neon fleece
| ablaze between the blowing clouds,
| the final breath before the night.
| 
| the setting world ignores the sun,
| its traces shun the swirling dark
| in arcs that cling to pearls of light. 
|
| the silent dance of leaves through black, 
| the lacks you left within the breeze
| that day you laughed and said to me:
|
| embrace the fading space between
| the nothing and the everything,
| the falling leaves and all they bring.
