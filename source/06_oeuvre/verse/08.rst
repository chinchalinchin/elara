Falling Leaves
--------------

| the autumn bleeds its fallen leaves,
| enthralling me with awful dreams
| of auburn weaves my fingers clasped.
| 
| a swirling world that gasps in gales 
| of colored veils adorning curls
| unfurled in lines the gusts unwind.
| 
| while afterglows of neon bind
| the blaze between the blinded clouds
| that breathe their final breath of light.
| 
| at dusk, we clung, embraced but stunned,
| our traces spun through hissing dark
| in whispered arcs the wind erased.
|
| the fallen leaves arrayed your face 
| within that shaded sprawl of grace,
| the place that fades as seasons fall.
