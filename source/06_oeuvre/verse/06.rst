| the city edge, its concrete knife
| divides the Earth, creates a cliff
| the shifting gears engage to dive,
| a morning drive becomes a trek
| along the etching mountainside,
| the tips of which all signals die;
| ascending poles of cable lines,
| the crooked rubber vines that test
| the forest depth infested heights  
| with swarming trails of valleyed years
| much older than the minutes here,
| forgotten since and gone to ground,
| to gravel found upon the paths 
| unravelled round the bend today,
| today a day the years return,
| it turns around to me again,
| repeated now, but far removed
| by twisted roads that have no end,
| where maps pretend to know the way
| through swaying wilds of ancient pine
| inclined on slants of slated shelves,
| that delve the dark of cratered holes
| around reverbing curves that skirt 
| the skids my spinning makes in dirt;
| the thinning miles, the barren miles,
| as humans fade, the tree empires
| expanding spans of secret green,
| and losing me, i find the top,
| the spot we used, the place you said
| you'd always be, but all remains
| decayed, reclaimed, reversed, undone, 
| embedded in the layered lime.

.. epigraph::

  Dear Grant,

  Grant, I like the movement at the start of the poem "Anniversary"

  "the city edge, its concrete knife
  divides the Earth, creates a cliff
  the shifting gears engage to dive"

  I enjoyed reading your poems. You stay present in your writing. Words do float off the page with consistent effort.

  I am the new Arts Editor for Merion West; we are in transition. This set of poems is not quite right for Merion West at this point. Continue to revel in the craft of writing.

  Thank you for sharing your work with Merion West. We wish you the best in your writing.

  -- Austin Allen James
