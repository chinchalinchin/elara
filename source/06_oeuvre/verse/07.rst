Billboards
==========

| the world is tinged with sweet regret
| as billboards flash their pixel paint. 
|
| what time remains sustained is froze
| in photographs above the roads.
|
| these faces once acquainted race
| by windows, smeared as though i dream. 
|
| from point diverged our common lines,
| to track our ways and write our lives.
|
| ensuing years then ripped apart
| the ribbons left by broken hearts.
|
| i find you here, in signs that pass;
| we intersect our threads at last.
|
| the highway wends away in bends
| towards ends i pray that meet again.
