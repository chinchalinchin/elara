Billboards
==========

| the world is tinged with sweet regret
| as billboards flash their pixel paint. 
|
| what time remains sustained is froze
| in photographs above the roads.
|
| these faces once acquainted race
| by windows, smeared as though i dream. 
|
| from tip diverged our common line,
| to track our ways and write our lives.
|
| ensuing wakes ripped apart
| the ripples left by broken hearts.
|
| i find you here, when years have passed;
| we intersect again at last.
