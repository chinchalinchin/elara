Father's Lullaby
----------------

| Dear child, the monsters under bed
|   are not just make believe.
| They lurk in shadows overhead
|   and offer no reprieve.
|
| Dear sweetling, sleep with open eye
|   and guard your dreams at night.
| Ignore your mother's lullaby,
|   keep candles burning bright.
|
| Beware the lair that closets hide,
|   the racks of their disguise,
| the suits and ties, the cuffs that slide
|   and cloak them from your eyes.
|
| Fear not the slash of sharpened claws,
|   the flashing terror brief,
| but stamps that mark the written clause
|   with laws of fierce belief.
|
| What evil deeds those stories tell
|   prepare your heart to meet
| the formal world where heroes fell
|   to wander incomplete.
