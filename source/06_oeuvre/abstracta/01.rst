    The Invocation of Metric Code
    =============================

    A Pythonic poem in (mostly) metric form.

    Hacks until the devs publish a fix:

    - "()", "[]", ".", ":", "_",  "=" and "==" don't contribute!
    - Comments are part of the poem! Except this one!
    - "pprint" = "puh-PRINT"

    """
    # at first, this helpful little shape
    from re import escape
    # and then some help for those who squint
    import pprint # that alters tint
    # at last, these ready words are spoke
    import invoke # to pry and poke
    import my_heart # but tender hold
    import provoke as smoke
    import thy_art # to break the mold

    def use(this="thought", with_mode="exhaust"):
