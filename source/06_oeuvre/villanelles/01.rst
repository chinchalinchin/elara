Crystal and Glass
-----------------

| i glue my heart of broken glass.
| refracted rays of you contract
| along the fractures breaks amass. 
|
| we fell in love upon the grass,
| a perfect shattered artifact.
| i glue my heart of broken glass.
|
| the lake was waving evening brass
| reflected in your eyes exact
| along the fractures breaks amass.
| 
| we shared the scent of sassafras
| as water braced for sun's impact.
| i glue my heart of broken glass.
|
| the summer lapped its final pass
| and left the surface still and cracked
| along the fractures breaks amass.
|
| in dreams, these grounds i will trespass
| to find their core, and shards extract.
| i glue my heart of broken glass
| along the fractures breaks amass.
