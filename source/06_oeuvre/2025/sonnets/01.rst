Larksong 
--------

| at least the larks remember songs
| each morning rise you're gone again.
| 
| the mourning veils of scattered throngs 
| depart your wake without amen.
| 
| the men who take your parts away
| forget to take my silent heart.
|
| they leave a lily black bouquet
| whose petals fingers tear apart.
| 
| and when i stand, the thoughts remain,
| the stems are bare and nothing's changed. 
| 
| the birds begin their last refrain
| as though they knew and prearranged.
| 
| if nothing else, their voice belongs;
| at least the larks remember songs.
