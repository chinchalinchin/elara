Christmas
---------

| the town is dead, in dying dreams 
| december trees with vying lights,
| the timbered scenes that blink unseen
| in eerie angles down the street.
| on holidays, the graves of men 
| are warmer than the fallen world,
| the sheets that form a shawl and tomb,
| the keepers of the doomed and spring.
| in dark the corpses grow and rot
| in pockets kept beneath the snow. 
| although i wander to and fro,
| the freeze that slows the world to stop,
| it wraps around in glowing rings 
| the steeples pointing up to show 
| my heart is aimed like arrowed bow,
| but lowered level to the ground
| where pounding feet, in treks alone,
| remember trees that grew back home.
