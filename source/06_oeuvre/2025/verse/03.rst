Photographs of Autumn
---------------------

| These photographs are brittle leaves
|    that fell from trees, that we once caught.
| I press them tender into sleeves
|    of glass to halt the course of rot.
| Though kept well fed with water shed,
|    they wilt to brown as colors fade.
| No leaf can live beside the bed,
|    without sunlight that makes the shade.
| Yet even still, though claimed by dust,
|    I keep them hung upon my wall,
| for memory you did entrust
|    of walk with you through golden Fall.
