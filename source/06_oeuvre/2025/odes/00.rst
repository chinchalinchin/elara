Ode to Death 
------------

| if i am doomed to die, to fade away,
| then let the Summer dig for me a grave
| so deep beneath her depths of supple clay
| to reach the slate my roots in dying crave,
| so seasons pass and cast 
|   my bone to hidden stone
|     through layers moistened brown,
| the loam of ages past
|   from gilded breezes blown
|     that ancient storms brought down.
| 
| in time, my stones will seep through Autumn seams,
| the teeth of grinding Earth that gnash the dead,
| returning flesh to banks of violent streams
| where fallen leaves revive in bloody red 
| remaining veins encased
|   in amber pebble tombs,
|     each waiting turns to die,
| depart this world erased
|   and face the end that looms
|     in dust of covered sky. 
|
| so keep these shards on sheltered shores and guard
| the song of raving larks and restless gaze;
| let nothing chance upon my resting yard
| as sorrow sheds its form, at last, decays;
| i have no edge to skip 
|   but only weight to sink,
|     so rising tides return
| in floods the currents whip
|   to Winter's very brink,
|     my stirring final churn.
|
| and when my ripples flatten back to glass
| remember once again the scent of Spring, 
| perfumed with wasted youth and sassafras,
| regret dissolved to tempest underwing,
| ascending cloudless heights 
|   through heaven's darkest spheres,
|     diluting down to air,
| returning now as lights,
|   this starry nest appears
|     to mark my vast despair.

  Hi Grant,

  Thank you for sending Landscapes/Cathedral/Ode to Death/Eulogy to SKUMMEL. Your piece stayed with us, haunting the room in the best way. While we decided not to accept it this time, it came close. We kept returning to it during our final reads. If you know what a personal rejection is, this is that.

  We’d love to see more from you in the future. Consider this an open invitation to send us your next work.

  Our pages are shaped by the voices that linger. Yours is one we hope will return.

  -- The Editors, SKUMMEL
