Eulogy
------

| mound of the earth, the funeral pyre,
| sermons of fire, infernos of oak.
|
| burning of briars, spiraling higher,
| chorus expired and softly I spoke:
|
| nothing is left, but cinders remain,
| warm to the touch, as memories fade. 
| 
| look to the thrashing showers of rain,
| mourn with the hissing coils arrayed.
| 
| pound for the taking, body of ash,
| weight of the flame, transmuted to wind. 
| 
| thundering void, in symbols that flash,
| scavenging clouds, futures descend.
| 
| weep with the water, falling to feet,
| honor your father, drink of his heat.
