Eulogy
------

| mound of the earth, the funeral pyre,
| sermons of fire, infernos of oak.
|
| burning of briars, spiraling higher,
| chorus expired and softly I spoke:
|
| nothing is left, but cinders remain,
| warm to the touch, as memories fade. 
| 
| look to the thrashing showers of rain,
| mourn with the hissing coils arrayed.
| 
| pound for the taking, body of ash,
| weight of the flame, transmuted to wind. 
| 
| thundering void, in symbols that flash,
| scavenging clouds, futures descend.
| 
| weep with the water, falling to feet,
| honor your father, drink of his heat.

.. epigraph::

  Hi Grant,

  Thank you for sending Landscapes/Cathedral/Ode to Death/Eulogy to SKUMMEL. Your piece stayed with us, haunting the room in the best way. While we decided not to accept it this time, it came close. We kept returning to it during our final reads. If you know what a personal rejection is, this is that.

  We’d love to see more from you in the future. Consider this an open invitation to send us your next work.

  Our pages are shaped by the voices that linger. Yours is one we hope will return.

  -- The Editors, SKUMMEL
