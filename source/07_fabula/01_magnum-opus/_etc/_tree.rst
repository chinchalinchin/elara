.. TASK: BRANCH BREAKOUT
..
..          - Break out the {{ new_branch }} into a new diagram.
..          - Starting Node: {{ starting_node }}
..          - Select a starting shade. The process for selecting a shade for a new branch is as follows: Find the other branches that exit from the same source branch, and using distance in the color space as a measure of time, find the next shade of the color group in the gradient. In other words, if a branch already has a green exit, then the next exit should be a lighter shade of green.
..          - Leave an exit node in the {{ source_branch}} diagram the same shade as the starting shade of the new branch.

.. ## TASK: COUSIN SEARCH
..
..      - Search pairs of branches for common surnames and relations that might indicate the marriage of cousins across branches and webs of relations that are not yet captured in the graphs. Verify and validate with evidence between concluding kinship.
..      - If any relations across branches are found, divide them into three categories:
..          - A. relations that can be fixed with an ENTER/EXIT relation.
..          - B. relations that require elaborate lineages of unexplored nodes in the family tree.
..          - C. relations that require elaborated lineages of external families before they can be visualized.
..      - Address and update relations of Type A directly on the graphs.
..      - Add relations of Type B to the *Further Review* list. These will be addressed in future prompts.
..      - Add relations of Type C to the *Ignore* list.
..
..      **TYPE B FURTHER REVIEW LIST**
..
..      None yet found.
..
..      **TYPE C IGNORE LIST**
..
..      - Node: "W6_2C_W (Equestrian) Catherine Ledyard Cogswell" to "FAM_COG (Patrician) is Ledyard Cogswell Jr."

.. TASK: NODE EXPANSION
..
..      - Find any endpoints of the {{ branch }} branch that are not ended with (--x), with (--o) or branched into another diagram ([[Branch Exit]]). **Select at most three** so you will have capacity to ensure any additions or modifications are rigorously vetted. Determine if they should be expanded around their descendants, or capped (--x).
..      - Ensure any nodes you add or update have birth and death years.
..      - Apply the retroactive rule to any branch **you modify** that has reached its endpoint (--x), i.e. convert their ancestors relation into a dot (--o)
..      - Ensure you follow all restrictions and guidelines. In particular, DO NOT TERMINATE A LINE WITHOUT EVIDENCE or REMOVE ANY NODES (unless justified by evidence).
