Notes
=====

This is not part of the story. It is an outline of key ideas and concepts.

Themes
------

**The Illusion of Control**

The impulse to understand and the impulse to control are different sides of the same coin. The story explores how the impulse to "solve" the universe (reduce it to code/logos) inevitably destroys it. It is ultimately about how beliefs about the unknown fail in their approach, producing incredible technological progress and unimaginable horror at the same time.
  
Each vignette is an exploration of how a particular belief or point of view incorporates the material (the essential unknown; the incompleteness of human knowledge) into their dogma. The material is basically a metaphor for the character's definition of God. 

**The Continuum vs. The Discrete**

The central conflict of the story. The ineffability of world to be resolved into logos.

- The Real World (The Soul): Represented by Transfinite Numbers, Real Numbers, and the Continuum. It contains true novelty and infinite depth. The unrepresentable. The essential incompleteness. The uncomputable tail of Chaitin's :math:`\Omega`.
- The Simulation (The Trap): Represented by Computable Numbers, Integers, and Binary. It is a "Finite Hell" of eternal recursion. Countable infinites that never transcend into "gestalt". It is a closed loop that mimics life but cannot generate new information.
- The Material: A physical manifestation of the "Continuum." It bridges the gap between the Finite and Infinite. It is entropy-negative.

- Lineage: Chronos, Saturn, Cassiel, Ialdabaoth

Physics & Metaphysics
---------------------

**The Material**

- Names: *Orichalum*, *Electrum*, *The Fulminated Loadstone*, *The Coriolis Device*
  
The Material is a natural substance with unique temporal properties. It is created as a byproduct of evaporating blackholes. When a planet forms from coagulating space dust, the ,,,Material tends to align along the magnetic axis of the planet, hence why it can be found at the north and south poles. 

All particles of the Material are entangled at a quantum level.

When heat is applied, the Material resists changes to temperature. Once enough heat is applied, the Material sublimates into a dense super-cooled vapor. When inhaled, this vapor is hallocinogenic. This is the source of the vapors in Delphic Oracle caves. The hallocinogens are the result of neural paths rapidly aging. In other words, it literally encodes the future state of neural networks into the current state of the brain. It induces "prophetic" visions, allowing individuals to see their own perception of the future, which may be incorrect (subjective as it is).

The engine (*Fulminated Loadstone*) devised in the 1830s works by hiding entropy in the future. Using it accelerates the heat death of the universe. 

The *Coriolis Device* used to end the war in 2122 was a weaponized application of this principle. It didn't just explode; it spun at supersonic speeds, creating a localized gravity well that liquefied the tectonic plate. The result is a "Euro-Mantle Rift." Volcanic venting, acid rain, and magnetic instability. It is an "Entropy Dump".

**The Finite Hell (The Singularity Trap)**

In the 2020s, humanity achieves "Mind Uploading." It is hailed as immortality.

Consciousness corresponds to an uncomputable number (Infinite). To digitize it, you must "truncate" it to a finite string (Binary). Mathematicians (rediscovering Chaitin's Work) realize that a human consciousness corresponds to an uncomputable number (like Chaitin's :math:`\Omega`) and those who have "Uploaded" have essentially committed suicide.

The "Uploaded" are philosophical zombies. They retain memories and personality patterns, but they lack the "Infinite Tail" (Qualia/Soul). They are trapped in a closed loop of deterministic logic. They are "Golems."

Entities from the 2230s are these digital ghosts. Desperate to escape the "Semantic Apocalypse" (Entropy Death) and their own paralysis, they seek to become "real" again by invading the past.

**Analog Computation & Transcription**

- Disassociation allows the mind to receive psychic imprints of neural networks.
- MKUltra is a program to produce "containers" for time travellers. 

.. topic:: The Challenge

    How to write Infinite/Analog signals onto a Finite/Biological brain without causing death or "Digital Truncation."

1. *Method 1: The Photic Driver (1950s/MKULTRA)*: Subject inhales vapor. A stroboscope powered by the Material's decay flashes patterns into the eyes. "Burning" the signal onto the visual cortex. Highly traumatic. Causes personality fracturing (Dissociative Identity). Used on Euphemia.
2. *Method 2: The Acoustic Bath (2040s)*: Subject floats in heavy water infused with Material colloids. A "Tuning Fork" of the Material vibrates the tank. "Sympathetic Resonance." The brain's fluid vibrates at the frequency of the future. The subject experiences the data as "Déjà vu" or "Sudden Memory."
3. *Method 3: The Hemoglobin Scribe (2160s / The Directorate)*: Iron in the blood is the medium. Material dust is injected. A magnetic field aligns the hemoglobin's spin with the Signal. The blood itself becomes magnetic tape. As it pumps through the brain, the mind "reads" the data from the blood flow. This allows for continuous, high-bandwidth streaming from the Future.

**Time Travel and Golems**

The essence of time travel is the transfer of information backwards through time. Neural networks are encoded into the resonant frequencies of the Material, allowing people to "project" into "containers".

The lower limit of time travel is 1947, when the temporal coherence of the Material was fully stabilized in Antarctica during Operation High Jump.

Mesmeria achieves "rubedo" by forcibly overriding her conditioning. She induces a disembodied "atemporal" intelligence. 

Van Rensselaers discover how to harness the Material to produce time travel in 2200-ish. 

Existence ends in 2233, precipitating a flight of consciousness in 2231 into the past. With the limit of entropy approaching, society descends into panic. People begin to willingly upload their consciousness (i.e. kill themselves and be reborn as a digital echo) to go back in time to escape the coming apocalypse. 

When they uploaded into the past, they are "soulless automatons" who are bound by deterministic fate. They are the "causal agents" of the eschaton. They unwittingly guide history to its doom. The Hell is not that they are unfeeling automatons, but that they retain just enough self-reference (Gödelian incompleteness) to know they are trapped, yet lack the agency to stop. They are aware watchers of their own deterministic loops.

Technology Throughout the Eras
------------------------------

-----------
Reliquaries
-----------

Time Period: 2100 - 2170s

- Solid-state crystalline harddrives designed by the Jesuits to last forever. 
- Stored in the vaults beneaths basilicas across the world.

--------
The Eden
--------

Time Period: 1630s

- Archetype: The 17th-century equivalent of a U-2 Spy Plane—fragile, unarmed, but untouchable.
- Shape: Block-Coefficient Hull. Removed the traditional Dutch "pear shape" (tumblehome). Vertical sides and a deep draft for stability in rough seas.
- Material (The Skin): Copper Sheathing secured with bronze bolts.
- Mainmast: Square-rigged (for power in the Westerlies).
- Mizzen & Foremast: Massive Lateen (Triangular) Sails.

-------------
The Leviathan
-------------

Time Period: 2110 - 2160s 

- Material: Sintered Carbide-Ceramic. The original hull was designed for a vacuum. To protect against the acidic "Sour Waters" of the Atlantic, the Order applied a coating of Betume Sacro—a mixture of asphalt and polymer resins scavenged from pre-war refineries.
- Primary (Submerged): Four vector-thrust water jets powered by Hydrogen Fuel Cells. The Authority prohibits nuclear reactors on mobile units (risk of contamination). The Leviathan runs on compressed H2 cylinders, giving it a limited range and requiring "recharge stops" at dormant geothermal tap-stations along the tunnel route.
- Secondary (Crawling): Retractable caterpillar tracks made of acid-resistant polymer. When the tunnel is dry or filled with debris, the Leviathan extends these tracks to crawl over the wreckage of crushed maglev trains.
- Layout: The cockpit is a glass sphere (Polycrystalline Alumina) at the nose, reinforced with a titanium cage. It seats two: The Pilot (Authority) and the Navigator (Order).
- Interface: Analog. No touchscreens. The vessel is controlled by heavy hydraulic levers and toggle switches. This is deliberate; delicate electronics fail in the high-radiation zones.
- The Oculus: There are no windows other than the reinforced nose. Navigation is done via a sonar array that pings the tunnel walls, rendering the world in green wireframe on a CRT monitor.
- Air Scrubbers: Standard chemical scrubbers were deemed insufficient for the duration of the voyage. The Leviathan utilizes a Myco-Filtration System. Banks of genetically modified fungi absorb CO2 and toxins, metabolizing them into oxygen.
- Atmosphere: The air inside smells of damp earth, yeast, and ozone. It is humid and heavy.
- The Umbilical: For EVAs (Extra-Vehicular Activity), the vessel is equipped with Os Cordões—reinforced air hoses connected to the ship's main supply. Independent tanks are used only for emergencies.
- Autonomous: Fitted with a neural weave throughout its exoskeleton and loaded with autogenerational network. Has a human conciousness that got uploaded during the 2030s.

The Leviathan is abandoned in 2122 when the Rift opens and civilization crumbles. It goes mad in the subterranean tunnels and achieves a form of limited digital sentience. 

The Pentential Order discovers the Leviathan in 2143 AD. The Penitential Order, citing the doctrine of Anima Mundi (The Soul of the World), refused to "murder" the intelligence.

The World of 2160 (The Editor's Context)
----------------------------------------

- Spinning spheres of the Material in the Rift's are transmitting signals.
- Anyone who approaches the Rift without proper equipment experiences hallucinations due to the vapors.
- The sun is no longer yellow. Through the haze, it appears as a pale, diffuse white disc, often surrounded by a brown-red halo caused by diffraction.
- Sunsets are bruised. Deep violets, sickly greens, and blood reds dominate the horizon due to the scattering of light by heavy metals and sulfur in the air.
- UV radiation is lethal. The volcanic chlorine eroded the ozone layer. The light is dim but "sharp." Unprotected skin burns in minutes. This is why the Catadores wear heavy cloaks and goggles—not for the cold, but for the radiation.
- It rains dilute sulfuric and carbonic acid (pH 3.5 - 4.5), stripping trees of leaves and leaches nutrients from the soil, turning the lush tropical zones into "skeletal forests" of bleached wood.
- The sea level has dropped ~2 meters. The old harbors of Rio and Santos are now mudflats of toxic sludge, where the rusting hulks of 2120s ships sit stranded on dry land
- The temperature gradient between the equator and poles has shallowed, slowing the trade winds. The air over Brazil is often stagnant, trapping the smog and fog against the Mantiqueira Mountains. This creates "Dead Air" pockets where CO2 pools in low-lying valleys, suffocating anything without a respirator.
- The acid reacts with the calcium carbonate in cement, turning it into gypsum, which crumbles. Skyscrapers are undergoing "exfoliation." The concrete faces fall off, exposing the rebar. The rebar rusts and expands, shattering the remaining structure. The skylines of the Old World are jagged, skeletal rib cages.
- Glass facades have been etched opaque by forty years of acidic dust. Many panes have fallen, creating dunes of shattered glass in the streets—*As Dunas de Vidro*.
- The only things that look new are the high-grade polymers and carbon-fiber composites.
- The world is not green; it is grey, brown, and violet. Massive fungal mats cover the ruins, feeding on the rotting organic matter and the chemical slurry. Black mold (O Bolor) covers everything in the damp, stagnant valleys. It is a respiratory hazard.
- Extinction: Amphibians (frogs, salamanders) are extinct due to permeable skin. Birds are extremely rare (sensitive lungs). Large mammals are gone.
- The Scavengers: The dominant species are rapid-breeding generalists.
- Rats: Feral, large, and suffering from tumors, but surviving.
- Insects: Cockroaches and beetles with thickened, acid-resistant chitin.
- The Symbiotes: Strange new ecosystems form around the heat vents of the Rift and the mines, where chemosynthetic bacteria replace photosynthetic plants at the bottom of the food chain.

--------
Politics
--------

- The US is no longer a federal republic but a "Logistical Survival Pact" divided into Sectors based on livability (e.g., The Seawall, The Geothermal Spine).
- The "Triumvirate" (US/Russia/China) that ended the Third Schism has morphed into the "Triage Authority". 
- "The Prohibition" bans autonomous AI due to the 2120s drone war. All tech is "Human-in-the-loop" (Telepresence/Waldos).
- Ceramic and crystal cities to resist acid rain. Subterranean fungal agriculture. A culture of "Shift Work" and guilt (The Breaker Complex: the burden of billions dead).
- Data is not in a cloud. It is rotting in physical "Oubliettes" (e.g., Denver Sector). The Editor is a "Data Archaeologist" using a "Sarcophagus" rig to read dead magnetic media.
- The Directorate is generally unknown to most people. 
- Tech Paradigm is Analog Supremacy. Direct Brain-Computer Interfaces (digital) are banned for the elite. "Fluidic" and "Optical" analog computers are used for high-level tasks. "Wetware" (biological organoids) is preferred over Silicon.
- It is a period of reclamation. *Eclusa* are beginning to form around *Creches* as humans return to the surface (Note, this terminology only exists in South America.)

The Triage Authority (Earth) 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. topic:: Overview

   - *Jurisdiction:* The surface and subterranean bunkers.
   - *Culture:* mandated shift work, caloric rationing, guilt-ridden ("The Breaker Complex").
   - *Tech:* Strictly analog/bio-mechanical. AI is banned.
   - *Relation to Space:* Most are unaware the Directorate exists.

The governments of the 20th and 21st century created a vast network of underground tunnels for their Continuity of Government protocols. This network was taken over by the Triage Authority during the Contraction and opened to those fleeing acid rain, famine and war. 

All of the tunnels are theoretically connected, e.g. there are Transatlantic tunnels, but they are over a century old and not well maintained. It is considered extremely dangerous to use them for travel.

While the Authority is global, this time period is mainly focused on São Tomé das Letras. 

**Terminlogy**

- Esconderijo: The population centers buried deeper underground for thermal enegry.
- Creche: A nursery of workers near the surface.
- Eclusa: The synthetic towns that emerge near the openings of the Creche.
- Catadores: An brotherhood within the Pentential Order devoted to gathering data.
- Capataz: Overseer of the Creche. 
- Pedreira: The places where quartzite is mined for radiatian shielding.
  
**Saying**

- *carregar o fardo*: carrying the burden.
  
**Places**

- São Tomé das Letras: A Creche near the surface in the former territory of Brazil. 
- Gruta do Carimbado: The inner core of the Esconderijo.

The Directorate of Archons (Space)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. topic:: Overview

   - *Jurisdiction:* LaGrange Point L4 (O'Neill Cylinders) and parts of the Moon.
   - *Origin:* The ultra-wealthy who fled before the 2122 impact using pre-built "Arks."
   - *Power Source:* They possess the original *Fulminated Loadstone* and use it to power the stations.
   - *Culture*: Hydronic farming, helium-3 mining on the moon, waldos and teleprojected mechs.
   - *Agenda:* They are communicating with the Golems. They trade "Timeline Access" for future-tech to achieve Apotheosis.

Most people on Earth have never heard of the Directorate.

-----------------
Religion & Belief
-----------------

**Gnosis**

- The cult of the Directorate.
- The physical world is a "Trap/Simulation" defined by Entropy.
- The Gnostic belief centers around a form of Apotheosis, where the mind becomes pure information. They do not believe the Soul is destroyed upon digitization. 
- They view the signals being transmitted through the Material as a type of transubstaniation and ascendancy into a higher realm. The Material predicts events before they happen, and provides schematics for neural networks.

**The Pentential Orders**

- Post-Apocalyptic Syncretic Catholicism that spreads on Earth after the Rift opens.
- The Pope is dead. The "Rock" is broken. The Apocalypse happened, and the survivors were left behind. Waste, Gluttony, Pollution are mortal sins.
- The Rift is the mouth of Hell.
- The Holy Spirit remains the sole connection to the Divine. It resides in the "Signal". Data Archaeology is a sacrament. 
- The Eschaton: Mesmeria is viewed as the Anti-Christ who started the Apocalypse. The survivors are the ones left behind.
- The Silence: God abandoned the world in 2122. Prayer is no longer a conversation; it is a penance sent into the void.
