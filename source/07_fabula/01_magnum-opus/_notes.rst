.. # NOTES 
.. 
.. ## THEMATIC VISION
.. 
.. - The impulse to understand and the impulse to control are different sides of the same coin. 
.. - The story explores how beliefs about the unknown fail in their approach, producing incredible technological progress and unimaginable horror at the same time.
.. - Each vignette is an exploration of how a particular belief or point of view incorporates the material (the essential unknown; the incompleteness of human knowledge) into their dogma. 
.. - The material is basically a metaphor for God. 
..
.. ## THE MATERIAL
..
.. The material is a natural substance with unique temporal properties. It is created as a byproduct of evaporating blackholes. When a planet forms from coagulating space dust, the material tends to align along the magnetic axis of the planet, hence why it can be found at the north and south poles. 
..
.. All particles of the material are entangled at a quantum level.
..
.. The engine devised in the 1830s works by hiding entropy in the future. Using it accelerates the heat death of the universe. 
..
.. ## PLOT POINTS
..
.. - Disassociation allows the mind to receive psychic imprints of neural networks.
.. - Van Rensselaers discover how to harness the substance to produce time travel in 2200-ish. 
.. - The lower limit of time travel is 1947, when the material was fully stabilized in Antarctica during Operation High Jump.
.. - MKUltra is a program to produce "containers" for time travellers. 
.. - The essence of time travel is the transfer of information backwards through time. Neural networks are encoded into frequencies of the material, allowing people to "project" into "containers".
.. - Mesmeria achieves "rubedo" by forcibly overriding her conditioning. She induces a disembodied "atemporal" intelligence. 
.. - Existence ends in 2233.
..     
.. ## CHARACTERS
..
.. - Stephen's motivations are meant to be highly ambiguous and open to interpretation. His own point of view and thoughts are never shared.

.. 1812 AD: The material arrives in New York in Stephen's care.
.. 1824 AD: The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is built to house and study the material. Stephen van Rensselaer pulls Eaton Amos out of jail to run the institute. Easy to blackmail.
.. 1825 AD: Stephen meets William Morgan at the Erie Canal opening. Enlists him to help engineer the gyroscope.
.. 1826 AD: William Morgan attempts to publish Illustrations of Masonry, but is kidnapped and murdered.
.. 1833 AD: Leonid Meteor Storm alters the material's physics, making it easier to spin and accumulate mass.
.. 1834 AD: Amos Eaton discovers the rudiments of operation at the Institute.
.. 1835 AD: Joseph Henry is brought in to study the artifact. He devises the theory for using it as engine. Creates the Fulminated Loadstone.
.. 1835 AD: Solomon establishes an underground smuggling operation for graphite, used to lubricate the Fulminated Loadstone.
.. 1837 AD: Maldoon convinces Renssalaer van Rensselaer over drinks that his father is using the graphite to supply the Patriot War. Plays on his insecurities.
.. 1838 AD: Maldoon ends up with the Fulminated Loadstone after Rensselaer's failed rebellion. Sends to Dead Letter Office in Washington DC to archive as evidence.
.. 1839 AD: Stephen van Rensselaer, the Good Patroon, dies. Without the Fulminated Loadstone, his enterprise crumbles upon his death.
.. 1840 AD: Ada Lovelace writes Note G to produce the Bernoulli numbers. These numbers are used in the decryption of the saved experimental data.
.. 1845 AD: Anti-renter movement leads to the downfall of van Renssalaerwyck and Patroonship.
