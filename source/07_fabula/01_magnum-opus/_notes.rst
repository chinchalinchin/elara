Notes
=====

This is not part of the story. It is an outline of key ideas and concepts.

Themes
------

**The Illusion of Control**

The impulse to understand and the impulse to control are different sides of the same coin. The story explores how the impulse to "solve" the universe (reduce it to code/logos) inevitably destroys it. It is ultimately about how beliefs about the unknown fail in their approach, producing incredible technological progress and unimaginable horror at the same time.
  
Each vignette is an exploration of how a particular belief or point of view incorporates the material (the essential unknown; the incompleteness of human knowledge) into their dogma. The material is basically a metaphor for the character's definition of God. 

**The Continuum vs. The Discrete**

The central conflict of the story. The ineffability of world to be resolved into logos.

- The Real World (The Soul): Represented by Transfinite Numbers, Real Numbers, and the Continuum. It contains true novelty and infinite depth. The unrepresentable. The essential incompleteness. The uncomputable tail of Chaitin's :math:`\Omega`.
- The Simulation (The Trap): Represented by Computable Numbers, Integers, and Binary. It is a "Finite Hell" of eternal recursion. Countable infinites that never transcend into "gestalt". It is a closed loop that mimics life but cannot generate new information.
- The Material: A physical manifestation of the "Continuum." It bridges the gap between the Finite and Infinite. It is entropy-negative.

Physics & Metaphysics
---------------------

**The Material**

- Names: *Orichalum*, *The Fulminated Loadstone*, *The Coriolis Device*
  
The Material is a natural substance with unique temporal properties. It is created as a byproduct of evaporating blackholes. When a planet forms from coagulating space dust, the ,,,Material tends to align along the magnetic axis of the planet, hence why it can be found at the north and south poles. 

All particles of the Material are entangled at a quantum level.

When heat is applied, the Material resists changes to temperature. Once enough heat is applied, the Material sublimates into a dense super-cooled vapor. When inhaled, this vapor is hallocinogenic. This is the source of the vapors in Delphic Oracle caves. The hallocinogens are the result of neural paths rapidly aging. In other words, it literally encodes the future state of neural networks into the current state of the brain. It induces "prophetic" visions, allowing individuals to see their own perception of the future, which may be incorrect (subjective as it is).

The engine (*Fulminated Loadstone*) devised in the 1830s works by hiding entropy in the future. Using it accelerates the heat death of the universe. 

The *Coriolis Device* used to end the war in 2122 was a weaponized application of this principle. It didn't just explode; it spun at supersonic speeds, creating a localized gravity well that liquefied the tectonic plate. The result is a "Euro-Mantle Rift." Volcanic venting, acid rain, and magnetic instability. It is an "Entropy Dump".

**The Finite Hell (The Singularity Trap)**

In the 2020s, humanity achieves "Mind Uploading." It is hailed as immortality.

Consciousness corresponds to an uncomputable number (Infinite). To digitize it, you must "truncate" it to a finite string (Binary). Mathematicians (rediscovering Chaitin's Work) realize that a human consciousness corresponds to an uncomputable number (like Chaitin's :math:`\Omega`) and those who have "Uploaded" have essentially committed suicide.

The "Uploaded" are philosophical zombies. They retain memories and personality patterns, but they lack the "Infinite Tail" (Qualia/Soul). They are trapped in a closed loop of deterministic logic. They are "Golems."

Entities from the 2230s are these digital ghosts. Desperate to escape the "Semantic Apocalypse" (Entropy Death) and their own paralysis, they seek to become "real" again by invading the past.

**Analog Computation & Transcription**

- Disassociation allows the mind to receive psychic imprints of neural networks.
- MKUltra is a program to produce "containers" for time travellers. 

.. topic:: The Challenge

    How to write Infinite/Analog signals onto a Finite/Biological brain without causing death or "Digital Truncation."

1. *Method 1: The Photic Driver (1950s/MKULTRA)*: Subject inhales vapor. A stroboscope powered by the Material's decay flashes patterns into the eyes. "Burning" the signal onto the visual cortex. Highly traumatic. Causes personality fracturing (Dissociative Identity). Used on Euphemia.
2. *Method 2: The Acoustic Bath (2040s)*: Subject floats in heavy water infused with Material colloids. A "Tuning Fork" of the Material vibrates the tank. "Sympathetic Resonance." The brain's fluid vibrates at the frequency of the future. The subject experiences the data as "Déjà vu" or "Sudden Memory."
3. *Method 3: The Hemoglobin Scribe (2160s / The Directorate)*: Iron in the blood is the medium. Material dust is injected. A magnetic field aligns the hemoglobin's spin with the Signal. The blood itself becomes magnetic tape. As it pumps through the brain, the mind "reads" the data from the blood flow. This allows for continuous, high-bandwidth streaming from the Future.

**Time Travel and Golems**

The essence of time travel is the transfer of information backwards through time. Neural networks are encoded into the resonant frequencies of the Material, allowing people to "project" into "containers".

The lower limit of time travel is 1947, when the temporal coherence of the Material was fully stabilized in Antarctica during Operation High Jump.

Mesmeria achieves "rubedo" by forcibly overriding her conditioning. She induces a disembodied "atemporal" intelligence. 

Van Rensselaers discover how to harness the Material to produce time travel in 2200-ish. 

Existence ends in 2233, precipitating a flight of consciousness in 2231 into the past. With the limit of entropy approaching, society descends into panic. People begin to willingly upload their consciousness (i.e. kill themselves and be reborn as a digital echo) to go back in time to escape the coming apocalypse. 

When they uploaded into the past, they are "soulless automatons" who are bound by deterministic fate. They are the "causal agents" of the eschaton. They unwittingly guide history to its doom. The Hell is not that they are unfeeling automatons, but that they retain just enough self-reference (Gödelian incompleteness) to know they are trapped, yet lack the agency to stop. They are aware watchers of their own deterministic loops.

The World of 2160 (The Editor's Context)
----------------------------------------

--------
Politics
--------

- The US is no longer a federal republic but a "Logistical Survival Pact" divided into Sectors based on livability (e.g., The Seawall, The Geothermal Spine).
- The "Triumvirate" (US/Russia/China) that ended the Third Schism has morphed into the "Triage Authority". 
- "The Prohibition" bans autonomous AI due to the 2120s drone war. All tech is "Human-in-the-loop" (Telepresence/Waldos).
- Ceramic and crystal cities to resist acid rain. Subterranean fungal agriculture. A culture of "Shift Work" and guilt (The Breaker Complex: the burden of billions dead).
- Data is not in a cloud. It is rotting in physical "Oubliettes" (e.g., Denver Sector). The Editor is a "Data Archaeologist" using a "Sarcophagus" rig to read dead magnetic media.
- The Directorate is generally unknown to most people. 
- Tech Paradigm is Analog Supremacy. Direct Brain-Computer Interfaces (digital) are banned for the elite. "Fluidic" and "Optical" analog computers are used for high-level tasks to approximate a Continuum. "Wetware" (biological organoids) is preferred over Silicon because biology supports transfinite states; silicon does not.
- Spinning spheres of the Material in the Rift's are transmitting signals.
- Anyone who approaches the Rift without proper equipment experiences hallucinations due to the vapors.

The Triage Authority (Earth) 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. topic:: Overview

   - *Jurisdiction:* The surface and subterranean bunkers.
   - *Culture:* mandated shift work, caloric rationing, guilt-ridden ("The Breaker Complex").
   - *Tech:* Strictly analog/bio-mechanical. AI is banned.
   - *Relation to Space:* Most are unaware the Directorate exists.

The governments of the 20th and 21st century created a vast network of underground tunnels for their Continuity of Government protocols. This network was taken over by the Triage Authority during the Contraction and opened to those fleeing acid rain, famine and war. 

All of the tunnels are theoretically connected, e.g. there are Transatlantic tunnels, but they are over a century old and not well maintained. It is considered extremely dangerous to use them for travel.

**Terminlogy**

- Esconderijo: The population centers buried deeper underground for thermal enegry.
- Creche: A nursery of workers near the surface.

**Places**

- São Tomé das Letras: A Creche near the surface in the former territory of Brazil. 

.. GOAL: Build the world of São Tomé das Letras. How does the Authority manage a worldwide government? How does this particular Creche fit into it? How do the Pentential Orders factor in? This would be during the time period of humanity's reclamation of the surface. I am imagining Sao Tome das Letras as a river delta, where the "river" of humanity is being released into the "ocean" of the world again.

The Directorate of Archons (Space)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. topic:: Overview

   - *Jurisdiction:* LaGrange Point L4 (O'Neill Cylinders) and parts of the Moon.
   - *Origin:* The ultra-wealthy who fled before the 2122 impact using pre-built "Arks."
   - *Power Source:* They possess the original *Fulminated Loadstone* and use it to power the stations.
   - *Culture*: Hydronic farming, helium-3 mining on the moon, waldos and teleprojected mechs.
   - *Agenda:* They are communicating with the Golems. They trade "Timeline Access" for future-tech to achieve Apotheosis.

Most people on Earth have never heard of the Directorate.

-----------------
Religion & Belief
-----------------

**Gnosis**

- The cult of the Directorate.
- The physical world is a "Trap/Simulation" defined by Entropy.
- The Gnostic belief centers around a form of Apotheosis, where the mind becomes pure information. They do not believe the Soul is destroyed upon digitization. 
- They view the signals being transmitted through the Material as a type of transubstaniation and ascendancy into a higher realm. The Material predicts events before they happen, and provides schematics for neural networks.

**The Pentential Orders**

- Post-Apocalyptic Syncretic Catholicism that spreads on Earth after the Rift opens.
- The Pope is dead. The "Rock" is broken. The Apocalypse happened, and the survivors were left behind. Waste, Gluttony, Pollution are mortal sins.
- The Rift is the mouth of Hell.
- The Holy Spirit remains the sole connection to the Divine. It resides in the "Signal". Data Archaeology is a sacrament. 
- The Eschaton: Mesmeria is viewed as the Anti-Christ who started the Apocalypse. The survivors are the ones left behind.
- The Silence: God abandoned the world in 2122. Prayer is no longer a conversation; it is a penance sent into the void.
