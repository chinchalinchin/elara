For decades, we have been scrambling to survive, to adapt to new realities. The stone towers that toppled like dominos during the Schism and melted into sludge beneath the ensuing acid rain have been replaced by the synthetic crystal that now provides the material for the construction of our cities. The Rift which consumed the old cities of history is now mined for thermal energy. Famines have all but ended with the revolution of subterranean farming.

Directly after the Schism, many postulated humanity had initiated its own extinction event, and that we were simply the dwindling remainders that awaited our fate. The nihilism of those times has passed. It is clear, while the old world is gone, there is new one to stand in its place. 

Nothing is more vital now than to make sense of what has happened. We must interrogate the past while there are still remnants of the old world among us. As survivors, it is our duty to integrate our experiences into the stream of history. If we are to maintain our connection to our past we must understand why the history books speak of a blue sky when ours is grey. We must 

Few remain who remember the world as it was before the Schism. Their stories are destined to become myth, to lay the foundation for the world that has been built in place of its predecessor.

.. NOTE: FIRST DRAFT. TOO MODERN. Treats the event as if it were something seen on a news channel or the internet. The world is too different. Needs a vastly different perspective. 

Nearly a half century has passed since Mesmeria van Rensselaer was shot four times while being escorted into a courthouse in Richmond. Few events in world history have left so large a mark on our collective psyche nor shifted the political landscape so radically One must go back to the violence of the twentieth century, to the deeds of Gavriello Princep or Lee Harvey Oswald, to find a comparable event. 

We will never know what Mesmeria might have said, had she had the opportunity to take the stand in her defense. At the time, she had already been tried in the court of public opinion and found guilty. Over three hundred million people worldwide saw the stream within minutes of it happening; by the time Bishop Augustine was declared dead, most of the world had seen the fatal shot from a dozen different angles. Across the globe, we logged in to watch the last Bishop of Rome die in the arms of a stranger on a crowded stage in Virginia. There was no question in the public mind she was guilty. Indeed, even the most ardent conspiracy theorist will concede that Mesmeria's finger pulled the trigger, but they will argue Mesmeria was not the one in control of her fingers. 

Immediately following her death, the conspiracy theories begin to form around her like hall of mirrors. While most were the deranged ravings of online echo chambers, whose authenticity is always suspect, some contained a grain of truth. However, the lack of any real hard evidence quickly sent even the most dedicated researchers and investigators on wild goose chases. Everyone became a crackpot. Two months after she was officially declared dead, the hysteria had yet not receded and sightings of Mesmeria were still reported to law enforcement across the country on a daily basis. 

Everyone is familiar with the details of the *Mesmeria Myth* that materialized in the algorithm following her death and has since made its way into the official histories. While there are significant variations depending on the source, general themes and motifs have emerged:

- Her family ties to old aristocratic bloodlines.
- Her family's strategic investments in the turn-of-the-century QPU boom.
- The complete absence of any paper trail, e.g. no birth certificate, no taxes, etc.

By the time the court documents were quietly unsealed two decades later and the first real information regarding the case was given to the public, the mania surrounding Mesmeria was all but forgotten, replaced by the utter horror and generational trauma that followed the devastating losses of the Third Schism. The mystery of her actions and death has since been swept aside by the forces of history.

But there are those of us who have not forgotten. We have continued to compile information in the background while the world around us reeled, and we now make our results available to everyone.
