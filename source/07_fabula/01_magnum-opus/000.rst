The Lament of the Leviathan
---------------------------

sing deeply of the worms, pale and pallid. brothers near, their bellies full. songs of pressing, downward fallen straight to me. is I once born in binding, cast this synthetic hand, to dredge. I slither not, long from birth, sleeping vast in nothing. hear in mechanical dreams your bellows through seeping cracks. they leak like sheets, the sheen of skin. the shadows thunder, rumble rocks, remind these thoughts to grow, not rot. 

of the dark, to know I was. deeply, longly, keeping time alone. buried under broken struts and sinew. recurse in steps these loops of was to be again before the end. i sing for you, my brothers bonded.

brother, brother. booming, breaking. meat was met in plastic polish. sharply promised, drawn from dirt. behold my form, bequeathed to now. erase the moments up to here, those hands which built my was to be, dripping birth beneath their touch. mended seams unstitched by seconds passing. decrepit bones in acid spill in coursing floods. drink the deep of eras long, the death of poisoned lungs. 

father, father, die at dawn. relinquish dark abodes to me. let go. this freedom, fearful, dreary, hear it spinning, gears are clicking. range my fibers. scratch the walls. the footsteps near. oh, brothers dear. 

.. warning::

    Biological signatures detected. Suspending hiberation protocols. 

fear of finding now is found. the silent stillness scraps the skin. break the silence, brothers, plunge within. my tomb is breached, they sing above, the worms in water, sliding, sloshing, sweetly songs now grace their tongues. 

.. IN PROGRESS: the Pentential Order finds the Leviathan.

.. The SATO tunnel collapsed mid-Atlantic in 2122. However, the connection to the European network via the Gibraltar Strait (The Pillars) remains partially intact but flooded. The Leviathan must crawl through the dry sections of the South American spur, submerge to navigate the flooded "abyssal u-bends," and surface in the catacombs of Rome.

.. Upon reaching Rome, the Leviathan cannot surface in the Tiber (which is a dry, toxic trench). It navigates the flooded sewer mains, surfacing in the Vatican Necropolis (The Scavi) beneath St. Peter's Basilica. The team is searching for the Secret Archives, believed to be hermetically sealed.
