Magnum Opus
===========

Some moments are fulcrums, some events are meridians. Time is not the steady pulse of a pendulum, denominated in measurable units; it is the continuity of disparate points, the topology that binds its peaks to its valleys. The spline of history is fitted to tectonic eruptions, to the outpouring of our essence accumulating over long distances like waves building until broken in a terrifying surge, sweeping aside everything in the slurried wake. 

From the galactic to the molecular, this cycle repeats. Every empire is forged in the furnace of war; Every human life is demarcated by trauma and tragedy; Every atom dissolves into entropy. 

Like many others, I was born in the darkness of the underground. Conjured from the dirt, we came to be in the silence that followed the Contraction, when God finally departed from this coil and left mortals to perish under their own devices, as we went to ground and hid in caves to await our fate. 

The first time I saw the surface as a boy, I realized what had been taken from us. Anyone who has ventured out of the Creche and dared to ascend the tunnels has been met with the same realization. Across the barren land lay the dessicated corpse of a world in which I did not belong, in which I walked as an outsider, forgotten and unnoticed. I am of the darkness, and this world is made of light.

Within the infinite heavens lay the constellations, the eternal nails upon which hang the threads of the firmament, those ancient lights which bore witness to all the calamities and madness the absence of our Lord has heaped upon the world. Dumbstruck I gazed upon the stars and realized I had no concepts to comprehend them.

The world itself has been taken from us.
