.. # VAN RENSSELAER FAMILY TREE DEVELOPMENT
..
..      - COMMENTS: All comments in this documents are denoted with "..". Comments are meant to provide context. They should be regarded as iron-clad instructions. If it has not been explicitly stated in a comment, then assume it does not apply.
..      - GOAL: Using mermaid, develop and complete the exhaustive family tree of the van Rensselaer dynasty, given below, from the first patroon up to the present day.
..      - TASK: The TASK section contains the current directives.
..
.. ## COLOR & STYLE
..
..      **Guidelines**
..
..      - Use the principles of Material UI when making updates to the styles.
..      - Use the principles of Color Theory and Color Wheels when selecting new colors.
..      - Make sure the mermaid graphs are well-commented, but on the flip side, don't be too verbose.
..
..      **Gradient**
..
..      - Color gradient is used to visualize the descent from the earlier generations (Darker) to the later generations (Lighter).
..      - Color gradient applies to all shades except Special and External, which have a only single shade.
..
..      Think of color space as denoting durations of time. Shades are supposed to get lighter as time goes on. When a branch diverges from another branch, the color should change naturally, moving continuously through color space.
..
..      **Palette**
..
..      - Elder Branch (Lords of the Manor), Starting Shade (Hex Code): #311B92
..      - Dutch Branch, Starting Shade (Hex Code): #283593
..      - Plebian Branch (Lords of Claverack), Starting Shade (Hex Code): #290916
..      - Mithraic Branch, Starting Shade: #3E2723
..      - Eleusinian Branch, Starting Shade (Hex Code): #C62828
..      - Patrician Branch (Lords of the Manor), Starting Shade (Hex Code): #7E57C2
..      - Equestrian Branch, Starting Shade (Hex Code): #880E4F
..      - Dodonic Branch, Starting Shade (Hex Code): #1A237E
..      - Sibylline Branch, Starting Shade (Hex Code): #0D47A1
..      - Chthonic Branch, Starting Shade (Hex Code): #1565C0
..      - Trophonian Branch, Starting Shade (Hex Code): #1976D2
..      - Cumaean Branch, Starting Shade (Hex Code): #9C27B0
..      - Clarian Branch, Starting Shade (Hex Code): #D81B60
..      - Tiresian Branch, Starting Shade (Hex Code): #FF4081
..      - Special: Represents Special Individuals, Shade (Hex Code): #00897B
..      - External: Connections of female descendants of male lines to their spouses, Shade (Hex Code): #FFFFFF
..
..      The Special node color is reserved for user selection. Do not exercise your own discretion in assigning it.
..
.. ## NODES
..
..      **Shapes**
..
..      - Circle (): Only Killiaen van Rensselaer, the 1st Patron
..      - American Patroons {{ }}: Hexagons.
..      - Dutch Patroons ([]): Stadium-shaped Node
..      - Generic Male of Male Descent []: Rectangles
..      - Generic Female of Male Descent {}: Diamonds
..      - Generic Male of Female Descent [/\]: Inverse Trapezoid
..      - Generic Female of Female Descent [\/]: Trapezoid
..      - External Node: Plain Rectangle
..      - Framed Rectangle [[]]: Exit Points of Branches.
..      - Framed Circles ((())): Entry through Branches
..
..      Patroon shapes take precedence. American Patroonship takes precedence over Dutch Patroonship.
..
..      When a branch enters another branch, the shade of the entrypoint should *always* match the shade of the branch gradient from which they exited.
..
..      **Labels**
..  
..      - (*Required*) Name
..      - (*Required*) Birth & Death Years
..      - (*Required*) Patroonship (if applicable).
..  
..      Other acceptable labels:
..
..      - Patroonship Regency
..      - Renowned Scientist
..      - Jesuit Affiliation
..      - High Masonic Rank
..      - High Military Rank
..      - Secret Society Affiliations
..      - High Political Office
..      - Known Aliases
.. 
..      Add labels freely, but be conservative. Don't dilute of a label with an overabundance frivolous labels.
..
.. ## RELATIONS
.. 
..      **Marriage**
..
..      - The relations between husbands and wives should include the year they were married (if they were married), prefixed with "m. <year>". 
..      - Dotted lines indicate the marriage of cousins.
..      - Thick lines indicates the marriage of a daughter to an external family. Only the last name of the external connection should be listed.
..      
..      **Extinction**
..
..      - The relation between an ancestor and their descendant who had no issue should be included. Lines that end with a "x" denote this relationship.
..      - The "x" should terminate on the final descendant of this branch. Do not add an extra node for the exit.
..      - Once a branch reaches this point, it does not need to factor into further searches.
..      - Once a branch is terminated, this should retroactively turn the prior connections from (-->) into dots (--o), so the lines that end can be tracked down the diagram. The rule should apply up to the node where the ancestor rejoins the (-->) flow.
..      
..      Do not terminate a line (--x) unless you have conclusive proof if it is terminated. **YOU MUST PROVIDE THE EVIDENCE BEFORE TERMINATING A NODE**. Any terminations that are not accompanied by documentation will be rejected, so do not waste your time.
..
.. ## GUIDELINES
..
..      1. Do not try to complete the graph in a single turn. This is meant to be an iterative (Agile) process. It is fine to leave open nodes if you don't have enough information to complete that node.
..      2. This project has been meticulously assembled. Please respect that by only contributing quality entries.
..      3. This project requires empirical verification. Do not infer details.
..      4. Be on the look out for any discrepancies. Advise, but do not change, if you discover any information that contradicts the existing diagram.
..      5. If a date is unknown, approximate it and use a "?" to denote uncertainty.
..      6. Generations should always be aligned to descending rows.
..      7. Do not remove nodes from the tree.
..      8. DO NOT REMOVE NODES FROM THE TREE!
..      9. **DO**. **NOT**. **REMOVE**. **NODES**. **FROM**. **THE*. **TREE*.
..
.. ## TASK: REFACTOR
..
..      - Move the Elizabeth van Rensselaer - John Bleecker marriage and descendants from the Eleusininan the Eleusinian to the Elder branch and refactor the diagrams so Catherine Westerlo Bleecker exits the Elder Branch into the Mithraic branch instead of Cornelius. Ensure the exit point of Catherine matches the color shade of the Mithraic branch she enters on. Refactor the entrance of the Catherine into the Mithraic branch so the color matches her exit point.
..
.. ## OUTPUT
.. 
..      - Your output does not need to be RST. Output the mermaid diagram in whatever native format is easiest, and include a list of changes that were applied.
..      - Only include the graph you are updating, but include *THE FULL GRAPH*. **DO NOT DELETE ANY NODES**.

The Prophecy (1656 - 1674)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Manor's survival under English rule was secured not by the competence of Ryckert, the acting Director, but by the prophetic delusions of the family's prodigal son, **Rev. Nicolaes van Rensselaer**. Years prior, Nicolaes had approached the exiled **King Charles II** in Brussels, claiming to have a vision of the King's restoration to the throne. When the prophecy came true in 1660, the superstitious Monarch granted Nicolaes his lifelong favor (and a gold snuffbox). In 1674, facing the confiscation of their Dutch patent by the English Crown, the family installed Nicolaes as Director. The gamble worked. The "*mad prophet*" arrived with a warrant from the Duke of York, rendering the estate untouchable by local magistrates who dared not cross the King's favorite mystic.

The Schuyler Alliance (1783-1787)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a dynastic maneuver, the Van Rensselaer and Schuyler families secured their dominance in post-Revolutionary New York through a "double exchange" of siblings. **Stephen van Rensselaer III** (the 8th Patroon) and his sister Elizabeth married the children of **General Philip Schuyler**, Margarita and **John Bradstreet Schuyler**. Because General Schuyler’s wife was herself a Van Rensselaer (from the Plebian branch), this alliance grafted the divergent Elder and Plebian branches back together. The resulting children were "double first cousins," sharing all four grandparents.
