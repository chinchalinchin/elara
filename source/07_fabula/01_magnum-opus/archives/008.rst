Results
~~~~~~~

It's cold. Why is life so cold? Where is father? They say that I am angry with you. What have you done? What have you done *to me*? Why am I the one that must suffer for your sins? Father. Forgive me. I think I am dying. I don't want to die, Father. Why have I been born? What did I do to deserve this? Why do you hate me? Am to die in this place? I don't want to die here. God, please save me. 

Mother. Mother. What have I done? Who am I? The world is nothing but horror. It comes apart. Departs in waves. The violent storms. They roll out graves. In ice, we perish. It grows cold. Please hold me. I am scared. I am so scared. Why do we die, Mother? 

I don't understand the world you have made for us, Father. Surrounded by ice. Heartless, it beats. Timeless, it expands.
