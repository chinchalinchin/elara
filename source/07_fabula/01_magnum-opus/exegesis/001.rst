Like the majority of the synoptics, much of the information contained in its original form has been lost as the verse was shifted through different host languages. By the time English was the primary language of consumption, the original meaning was all but lost except to those who made it a point to study the original texts.

Typological analysis over the centuries has focused on the wordplay of the *Πέτρος-πέτρᾳ* pairing in the Codex Vaticanus, which was preserved in the Vulgate, but subsequently broken in the English translations. Indeed, reading this verse allegorically in Greek or Latin, it is impossible to ignore this obvious paronomasia; One would be forgiven for reading no further than the identification of Peter as the bedrock of the church he would later go on to found.

Yet the symbolism within this verse is not contained merely to the semantic realm. A true understanding only comes from *contextualizing* this semantic wordplay within the world it was spoken.

In the Gospel of Matthew prior to Verse 16, Jesus has taken the disciples to Caesarea Phillipi, one of the many outposts of the burgeoning Roman Empire. He speaks these words in front of the Cave of Pan.
