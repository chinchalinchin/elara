| Photographs
|
| A photograph of strangers' joy
| Atop the garbage, torn in half.
| Though lost, these ghosts in gloss deploy
|       a photograph. 
|
| Imagine tears that joyous laugh,
| The Autumn gowns and corduroy,
| A wedding banquet monograph.
|
| With age then mixed precise alloy
| From parts romance and epitaph,
| Til future hands at last destroy
|       a photograph.

| Walls
|
| Graffitied walls of yearly bloom
| With vagrant spray of aerosols;
| The vapors fume, condense and groom
|       graffitied walls. 
|
| The artists follow protocols:
| the lover's name, the prophet's doom,
| the epigraphs of homeless sprawls.
|
| The rarer buds of sweet perfume
| Are hidden deep in alley malls
| Where flowered faces sprung consume
|       graffitied walls. 

| Air
| 
| The fragrant air which wavers here
| in heat like harps of golden hair
| that sweep their shoulder length to clear
|       the fragrant air.
|
| The lily sermons whisper where
| I heard your blood through skin by ear,
| A moment made in silent stare. 
|
| The scent remains, you disappear,
| as wind now speaks your name in prayer,
| in razor gusts that whip and shear
|       the fragrant air.

| Ink
| 
| In fading ink, her fine details
| like curly cues and shades of pink,
| the shadowed lines that leak through trails
|       in fading ink.
|
| A paper mind she wrote to think, 
| so words replace what breath inhales
| and find my thoughts with hers in sync. 
|
| In letters light as chapel veils,
| I watch our dance as bodies sink,
| a final gasp of life exhales 
|       in fading ink.

| Seats
|
| The vinyl seats of classic cars,
| The plastic smell their thread secretes,
| This cherry burn on cover mars 
|       the vinyl seats.
|
| When Father stooped to sew the sheets,
| his needles stacked in columned jars,
| his fingers folded rows of pleats.
|
| My fingers trace the wells of scars
| As driving down the city streets
| My careless dropped reminder chars
|       The vinyl seats.

| Misty Morn
|
| One misty morn of summer days
| when clouds collected futures sworn.
| From mountaintops descended haze
|       one misty morn.
| 
| That day a dress of green was worn
| while sky dissolved in liquid grays,
| I took your hand and we were born.
| 
| The sun reclaimed our world with rays,
| dispersed the fog, revealed a thorn.
| The fated prick dispelled the daze
|       one misty morn.

| Dinner Wine
| 
| The dinner wine of nervous dates
| once grew upon a Summer vine.
| The Autumn wind now hushed awaits
|       the dinner wine. 
|
| Beneath the Winter's pure moonshine,
| our words distill like concentrates 
| til fingers find yours under mine. 
|
| A taste of Spring now circulates 
| as starry arcs began decline,
| the final drop that dedicates 
|       the dinner wine.

| Little Sprout
|
| Oh little sprout, the forest sleeps
| in arid ground now cursed by drought.
| Across the land, the desert sweeps
|       Oh little sprout. 
| 
| Your boldness lacks a water spout
| but hidden root in darkness steeps
| the moisture buried deep in doubt. 
|
| The dream of Spring nobody keeps 
| ascends in stems so small and stout 
| when mourning sky, in seeing, weeps,
|       Oh little sprout.
