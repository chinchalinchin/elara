In modern English, :ref:`being <being>` is the marriage of two concepts that were previously distinct. Its etymology descends from the coupling of the Old English words "`beon <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/beon>`_" and "`wesan <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wesan>`_", which can in turn be, if the theorists are to be believed, traced further back to the Proto-Indo-European roots of "*bheu*" and "*wes*", respectively. For this reason, we conjugate from the infinitive "*to be*"" two distinct varieties of words:

1. **B**-root words: *be*, *been* and *being*
2. **W**-root words: *was*, *were*.

"*Is*", a direct cognate from Old English, is the present tense conjugation of "*wesan*", revealing its hereditary from the *es*-stem roots that form the concept of :ref:`being <being>` in other Proto-Indo-European languages, such as the Spanish "*estar*" or the Italian "*essere*", and thus belongs to the latter group of conjugated verbs.

It is in the meaning of these words prior to their symbosis we find a starting point for understanding the separation of "*am*" and "*is*". The differences between the semantic function of "*beon*" and "*wesan*" is slight, but potent.

"*Wesan*" is the Being of objects and nouns. It is the "*is*" of the "*this*" and "*that*", the "*the*" and the "*a*". When affixed to a name, "*wesan*" indicates existence, what is actual about its subject. "*He is here*", "*you will be arriving soon*", "*there are three of them*". These are all existential statements of particular cases, facts which can be determined true or false by reference to reality. This type of concrete Being is contained in "*Wesan*".

    **wæron** þa dura belocene (the doors **were** closed)

    Her **wearð** Eadwine cing ofslagen (Here King Edward **was** slain)
 
To put it succinctly, "*Wesan*" is the empirical "*is*", the "*is*" which refers to the external world.

"*Beon*", however, is the :ref:`being <being>` of the abstraction and adjectives. "*Beon*" indicates an object's `gnomic aspect <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomic_aspect>`_. In the parlance of logic, a *gnomic* truth is a universal assertion, a statement of generality that applies to all things of which it speaks. While the Being of modern English does not have a direct *gnomic* form, a *gnomic* proposition can be induced by the removal of the particularizing article "*the*" in the following: *the birds are fast*. The use of  "*the* in this sentence refers to a particular group of birds, whereas the proposition "*birds are fast*" does not refer to any definite bird, but references the *gnomic aspect* of birds, i.e. the abstraction of form common to all avian entities. It is in this context that "*beon*" is conjugated in Old English.

    Ic beo gearo sona (I **will be** ready soon)

    Wiga biþ strang (Warriors **are** strong)

Mandarin has a similar variation in how it unpacks the relations of Being into representative form. In Mandarin, the verb "*是 (shi)*" can only be affixed to nouns, to signs representing physical objects,

    wǒ **shì** lǎoshī (You are a teacher)

However, "*是 (shi)*" cannot be affixed to adjectives, such as beautiful or loyal. For that, the extra verb "*很 (hen)*" is required,

    Nǐ **hěn** cōngming (You are smart)

Again in  "*是 (shi)*" and "*很 (hen)*"  the distinction of meaning found in "*wesan*" and "*beon*" is encountered, that of actuality versus abstraction. Indeed, this is a common duality to be found in languages across the world.

When "*wesan*" and "*beon*" were gradually merged in modern English, two meanings came to inhabit the same word. Still, to this day, these meanings have not yet been fully integrated, perhaps due to their mutual exclusion. There are defects in the merger that can be glimpsed, when words falter slightly in their aspect and :ref:`being <being>` reveals its separate meanings. The English :ref:`being <being>` haphazardly applies the ideas of concrete and abstract reality simultaneously, thereby allowing assertions of existence to be mixed with assertions of conceptualization, as seen in the propositions "*there is love*", "*this is justice*", "*hope is eternal*", etc. The English "*is*"" is capable of asserting abstracted existence, i.e. existence that is not reducible to objective reality.

---

The lack of precision in discussions of :ref:`being <being>` often leads to the participants overlooking this subtle distinction between the two notions. Indeed, the course of western philosophy depended throughout most of its history on the unexamined assumption these two types of :ref:`being <being>` were essentially the same, that is to say, that both "*am*" and "*is*" imply existence in the same way.

This necessarily leads to a duality of mind and body; if the primary mode of :ref:`being <being>` of both "*am*" and "*is*" is existential, then there must be a rupture in :ref:`being <being>`; things must divide into "*res extensa*" (literally: "*the thing which is extended*"), and into "*res cogitans*", (literally: "*the thing which thinks*"). In other words, :ref:`being <being>` is necessarily split into the physical and the mental because the "*am*" and "*is*" are both derivative of *existence*.

---

We are asking if the conjugation of "*am*" deserves recognition as an ontological operation over and above the existential operation of "*is*" which structures language. We are asking if it is a redundancy that is already included in "*is*", merely a syntactical construct with no semantic interpretation.

If the first case obtains, "*am*" provides structure distinct from the structure of the "*is*", essentially performing the function of dimensionalizing language, and the question "*what am I?*" has been granted a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a meaningful answer. If the latter case obtains, then the answer we seek is clearly some variation of "*I am* :ref:`nothing <nothing>`".

---

It must have been surprising to the first :ref:`being <being>` who recognized in language the image of the world. One is tempted to posit that exact moment as the historical origin of sentience. Akin to a photograph or a painting, a sentence is a reflection of :ref:`being <being>`; even when a painting depicts a fiction, it stil does so through the dimensions of necessity, through color and perspective, through representation; the same can be said of a sentence, for when we sketch the image of a paritcular :ref:`being <being>` in a proposition such as "*the pencil is over there*", we have, with words, captured the essential relationship embodied by an existent entity that is before us. We have "*photographed*" :ref:`being <being>` in words, reduced its momentary effervescence to a reproducible formulation.

---

What is it in :ref:`being <being>` ourselves that prevents us from :ref:`being <being>` other people? Why does our :ref:`being <being>` require perspective and individuality?

---

The :ref:`world <world>` inherently has an order, a structure that separates events through succession. Causality is manifest in time and space; things are a certain way, meaning the sequence of things that led to the current state of the world was just so and not some other way. Causality imposes a particular order on events, excluding the possibility of other orderings. Each event, by occuring, fixes the order of time as the particular circumstances that led to the current becoming of the :ref:`world`. It is a fact of symbolic logic that order relations must be anti-reflexive.

A reflexive relation is one that is the same forwards as backwards, i.e. :math:`x = y` is equivalent to :math:`y = x`.

An anti-reflexive relation can be seen in the relation of "*less than*", i.e. :math:`x < y` is not equivalent to :math:`y < x`. This asymmetry in the relation is what gives rises to its ordering. Because the relation cannot be reflected, the field of its values necessarily has an order, that is to say, each integer increases in magnitude, i.e. it is greater than its precedessor.

The ordering of time and space must necessarily make us ask, what is it about :ref:`being <being>` that is anti-reflexive? Where is the asymmetry in :ref:`being` to be found? Why are things always one way and not some other way? Why are things perceived in a linear fashion, that is to say, as a succession of form though time? What primitve rupture in reflection causes time to move forward, making thigns have an order?

---

    "I am this"

    "This is me"

When reflected, the "*am*" becomes an "*is*". Is this purely linguistic, an artifact of the peculiar evolution of the word ":ref:`being`"? Or is this the aforementioned rupture in the relation of :ref:`being <being>`? The English "*am*" is one-directional. It latches to its subject and severs its reflexivity. The  "*am*" reduces to "*is*" when the subject is object.

The "*is*" does not have this property.

    "This is a person."

    "A person is this.""

"*is*", in other words, is reflexive. There is no ordering in the existential relation of Being. It is, as mentioned, an equivalency relation.

---

The question, as always, is: is subjective :ref:`being <being>` the same as objective :ref:`being <being>`? And if it is, why does our linguistic representation of it bare the logical features of ordering? Why does our language allow the relation of "*am*" to operate in a non-reflexive way?

---

.. topic:: Conjecture

    *am* is the asymmetric *is*.

Or, in terms of ontological relations, existential :ref:`being <being>` is an equivalency relation. Subjective :ref:`being <being>` is an ordering relation.

.. epigraph::

    ":ref:`Being <being>`" is said in many ways.

    -- `Metaphysics`_, Aristotle

It is first of all said, and "*to be said*" requires what is said to be expressible in :ref:`language <language>`. Every linguistic form is a representation. Therefore, something said is necessarily representative of some other thing. What a representation is and what it is representative of is left vague in the beginning, but the form of representation is not: :ref:`language <language>`.

In order to understand the initial statement, one then turns to an analysis of :ref:`language <language>` in order to clarify what could possibly be meant by a thing which can be said. A description of :ref:`language <language>` is a necesary component of any exposition that wants to analyze the ways in which ":ref:`being <being>`" is said. In making this description, one immediately encounters the essential problem in ontological endeavors: describing the operation of "*description*"" is itself a description.

Every system of thought, by objectifying the world, makes an object of itself within that system. "*System*" in this sense is synonymous with and equivalent to ":ref:`language <language>`".

For instance, lingustic representations possess the property of standing for things they themselves are not.

.. note::

    Let "*R*" stand for things that are red.

    Let "*B*" stand for things that are blue.

Here a letter, "*R*" or "*B*" , stands in place of something else. These letters are *representations*. Note the letter "*R*"" is not a thing that is red, except in circumstances where it is printed in red ink. Rather, it symbolizes the conjunction in thought of elements that possess the attribute of ":ref:`being <being>` *red*". The letter "*R*" makes an abstraction of the elements we agree belong to it.

On the other hand, there are sometimes classes of words that stand for themselves, or at least include themselves in that for which they stand. For example, the word "*word*" is a word that stands for the thing which it is,

    "*Word*" is a word.

However, a crucial distinction must be drawn in these cases. The quotation marks in the preceding example are not frivolities. They are a necessary component of the proposition, for they provide a boundary that outlines a thing's *name*. Sans quotation marks, the proposition descends into senselessness,

    Word is a word.

This analysis hinges on the realization first proffered by Tarski that there is a consequential difference between the :ref:`language <language>` in which we speak propositions of a :ref:`language <language>` and the :ref:`language <language>` in which we speak *about* the propositions of a :ref:`language <language>`.

    The :ref:`language <language>` one speaks is not necessarily the :ref:`language <language>` about which one speaks.

Confusion often results when the same :ref:`language <language>` performs both functions. In the case of mathematics, where the proposition :ref:`language <language>` is that of, say, arithmetic, and the description :ref:`language <language>` that of logic, the distinction is easier to maintain. When doing philosophy, the different levels of speech often waver and blur together, leading to confusion. For the purposes of clarity, quotation marks serve the function of referring to the name of the concept addressed whereas a unquoted word expresses what is meant by the concept. This lack of clarity throughout history is one of the root causes of Martin Heidegger's deconstruction of ":ref:`being <being>`" in the early twentieth century.

If the goal is to define ":ref:`being <being>`", then one can only succeed at the level of description. A description *about* a " :ref:`being <being>` " is incapable of saying what is meant by ":ref:`being <being>`".

---

The problem is :ref:`truth <truth>`. It's impossible to define. More precisely: it's definition undoes its foundation. If you say: something is :ref:`true <truth>` if it is the case (i.e. agrees with reality), then by allowing the indeterminate sentence to be named, even with a name so innocuous as "something", you've allowed the necessary and sufficient conditions for a contradiction to emerge. Let the next sentence be called P. The sentence P is not true. Then, by our definition of :ref:`truth <truth>`, we see we have named an undecidable sentence.  More than that, we have annihilated the possibility of :ref:`truth <truth>` by demonstrating an example of something to which it cannot apply, that is, something neither true or false. Self reference is a paradox that cannot be exorcised; it's impossible to give a name to something without that name referencing the thing to be named. You cannot talk about :ref:`truth <truth>` without giving things names and you cannot name a thing without decimating the foundations of language. We arise from a vacuum of meaning, and blindly seek what cannot be sought. All that we know and think is built on top of a void.

.. epigraph::

    What is not truly one :ref:`being <being>` is not truly *one* :ref:`being <being>` either.

    -- `Leibniz Letters`_, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz

To say the same thing in a different way,

    To be a *being* is to be *a* being.

Apparently :ref:`tautological <tautologies>` in form, the exact meaning of the Liebniz's :ref:`proposition <proposition>` can only be understood through the emphasis placed on its constituent words, which in turn immediately enriches its otherwise vacuous content. In this way, the words in Leibniz's :ref:`proposition <proposition>` have semantic content that is not contained in their letters, if by "*letters*" it is meant "*characters of the alphabet*". This is obvious in :ref:`languages <language>` with aspirated breathing marks, where the operation of emphasis possesses a symbol within the :ref:`language <language>`, but English can be deceptive in this regard, for italicization or boldening are not normally considered a linguistic symbol, even though they possess no warrant to belong to any other classification.

Leibniz's emphasis is a form of naming that would more naturally be represented with quotation marks. The lefthand side of the :ref:`proposition <proposition>` selects the name of :ref:`being <being>`, ":ref:`being <being>`", preparing it for the operation of definition. The selection is then equated through the copula of :ref:`being <being>` to the righthand side, which defines the named :ref:`being <being>` as the :ref:`being <being>` of the name of the article through which it is selected for naming. A ":ref:`being <being>`" is nothing more than an index attached to a :ref:`being <being>`.

The operation of naming can be understood in terms of pure direction. A rule is given that picks a name from the domain of names and assigns to it an object in the domain of objects. In the preceding sentence, "*object*" is not necessarily equivalent to "*thing*", and might be more precisely described as "*an indeterminate* :ref:`being <being>`".

What is :ref:`language <language>`? Did it emerge gradually or all at once? Was there a point in time when no :ref:`language <language>` existed and the next it did?

Does the distinction between :ref:`meta-language <language>` and :ref:`object language <language>` exist in actuality? Is there a :ref:`language <language>` *about* :ref:`language <language>`, where the general conditions for :ref:`language <language>` can be precisely specified? What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for :ref:`language <language>`? Can :ref:`language <language>` be described in aggregate?

The nature of :ref:`language <language>` is elusive. It begs an unending series of questions and offers little in the way of answers. It resists definition, for definitions occur within it. It resists analysis, for analysis occurs within it. :ref:`Language <language>` is a vicuous circle. :ref:`Language <language>` is *the* vicuous circle, from which all others originate. Language is inescapable and intractable. One might attempt to formalize :ref:`language <language>`, but every attempt hitherto has failed. There are always aspects of :ref:`language <language>` that exceed any container we construct for it. Indeed, there appear to be certain syntactical constraints that can be placed on the general science of :ref:`language <language>`:

1. :ref:`Language <language>` is a hierarchy of ordered sequences. Words are ordered sequences of characters. Sentences are ordered sequences of words.

This seems fundamental. If there is a purely logical and formal principle underlying :ref:`language <language>`, surely this is it.  Almost every known :ref:`language <language>` conforms to this model, in some way. However, even with this meager claim, the most miniscule of structural propositions (that structure *exists*), counter-examples can be produced that show this :ref:`axiom <section-ii-ii>` fails to span the entire breadth of the phenomenon of :ref:`language <language>`.

To start, the concept of declension immediately challenges this hierarchical model of :ref:`language <language>`. In :ref:`languages <language>` like Greek or Latin, the suffixes appended to words denote its part of speech. Consider the three Latin sentences,

- Puella canem videt. (Girl dog sees)
- Canem puella videt. (Dog girl sees)
- Videt puella canem. (Sees girl dog)

Each sentence, in essence, expresses the same proposition, showing that sentences are not necessarily constrained to be ordered sequences of words. The order of the declined words is not *meaningless* in this example, as order in declined :ref:`language <language>` often denotes emphasis, but importantly, it is not the *primary* bearer of meaning. However, the spirit of the model can be recovered by adjusting structure of hierarchy, perhaps by adding a layer above sentence for "*tokens*", of which each of the previous sentences is an instance.

However, there is a more fundamental challenge to the hierarchical model of :ref:`language <language>`. Similar to declension, agglutinative :ref:`languages <language>` accumulate meaning through suffixes applied to roots. The boundary between *sentences* and *words* is not well-defined in an agglutinative :ref:`languages <language>`.

In the Native America :ref:`language <language>` of Central Alaskan Yup'ik,

    tuntussuqatarniksaitengqiggtuq

Translates roughly to "*He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer.*" Describing this linguistic entity as a "*word*" does not fully elucidate its role in Yup'ik :ref:`language <language>`; it would be more accurately classified as a sentence, but that also is not entirely true. The "*words*" of the "*sentence*" are not delimited by blank characters or other marks, so that it appears to an Indo-European speaker to be a single word. This "*sentence-word*" is formed by stacking morphemes into a single word,

1. ``tuntu-``: reindeer
2. ``-ssur-``: to hunt
3. ``-qatar-``: will be going
4. ``-ni-``: to say that
5. ``-ksaite-`` : not yet
6. ``-ngqiggte-`` : again
7. ``-uq``: third person indicative mood

.. note::

    This is a very approximate mapping to English. Take it with a grain of salt.

As another example of an agglutinative phrase, consider the Turkish,

    evlerimde

The root ``ev``, *house*, is modified by a plural suffix ``ler``, a possessive suffix ``im`` and then a prepositional suffix ``de``, so that it translates into English as "*in my houses*". This :ref:`language <language>` formation process may be visualized as a type of functional composition. A root has a grammatical operation applied to it,

.. math::

    \text{plural}(x) = x + \text{ler}

Where :math:`x` is the root and :math:`+` represents concatenation. Similariy, the operators for possession and preposition can represented,

.. math::

    \text{possessive}(x) = x + \text{im}

    \text{preposition}(x) = x + \text{de}

Then, the word ``evlerimde`` can be represented formally as,

.. math::

    \text{preposition}(\text{possessive}(\text{plural}(x)))

In other words, a "*word*" in an agglutinative :ref:`language <language>` is a sequence of operations applied to a root, where the operations *are* the grammatical structure of the :ref:`language <language>`.

The essential nature of :ref:`language <language>` appears to be sequential, but identifying *what* is being sequenced presents a problem. We want to name the terms of linguistic science, but there seems to be no universal property that is manifested in every instance of :ref:`language <language>`.

To reconcile these two distinct categories of :ref:`language <language>` (called *synthetic* and *analytic*), linguistics often treats *morphemes* as the smallest semantic unit (the smallest token in a sentence that bears meaning), from which larger complexes are constructed.

However, there is a subtle problem in this model, which is not necessarily a flaw, but does commit its proponents to an ontological position they might not be willing to adopt were it made explicit.

The morpheme model of :ref:`language <language>` that unifies analytic and synthetic :ref:`languages <language>` requires viewing the referents of signs (symbols, abstractions) indirectly. In other words, a sign from this model does not directly signify the signified, but does so through modalities that alter its apparent form. To state more clearly, this :ref:`language <language>` model supposes a universal term preexists the particular instance of it within the sentence and moreover, it supposes the essential process of :ref:`language <language>` is to instantiates these universals into particular words or sentences.

Moreover, this abstraction requires syntactic artifices like *null morphemes* to describe how morphological operators behave when applied to certain lexical roots,

.. math::

    \text{plural}(\text{horse}) = \text{horse} + \text{s}

    \text{plural}(\text{deer}) = \text{deer} + \varnothing

However, this representation is slightly misleading in its form. A more accurate formal model would distinguish the tokens "deer" and "horse" (i.e. the *names* of their conceptual locus) from their written representation. Letting :math:`\mathfrak{x}` stand for the token, :math:`x` for its written representation and :math:`f` for the morphological operator,

.. math::

    f(\mathfrak{x}) = x + s

    f(\mathfrak{y}) = y + \varnothing

The important point in this formalization is that the token and the representation exist in different domains; one is mapped to the other.

In other words, this model seems to assert that when a speaker utters "*the cat is here*", the speaker is necessarily comprehending the word "*cat*" indirectly as the result of applying a :math:`\text{singular}()` operator to an underlying *essence*. Linguistics, it seems, has an implicit stance on the Aristotelian problem of the Universal, namely that universals exist, insofar as language is concerned.

A universal motif of creation myths is the prominence of *speaking* and *naming*. Almost every myth that attempts to elucidate the origins of existence describes a process where the very act of speech induces creation. The world is portrayed as *formless* and *void*, a sea of primordial *chaos*; it is :ref:`language <language>` itself that give structure to the penumbral shadow, pulling it into light and casting it into :ref:`beings <being>`. The ubiquity of this theme across different historical eras and disparate geographic areas suggests it is not merely random or circumstantial, but indicative of the fundamental pathology that language induces in the human mind.

Any assertions about the origin and historical development of :ref:`language <language>` must remain speculation, but nonetheless, certain patterns emerge from the available evidence. The earliest records of written :ref:`language <language>`, such as Ancient Egyptian or Sumerian, are pictographic in nature, meaning there tends to be a direct correspondence between the symbol and the object it represents, e.g. a sun is represented by a starburst or a fish by the crisscrossed curves that form its shape. The grammar of a purely pictographic :ref:`language <language>` is primarily extensional, meaning it does not have the syntactic glue to bind its presented concepts into complex relations except through their mere presentation. A pictogram of an axe juxtaposed with a pictogram of tree implies a certain action, but it does not contain complex modalities like motive, temporality or setting. Its possible interpretations are limited to simple utterances, "* tree cut down*" or "*man cuts tree*"; there are no syntactic markers upon which to hang the semantics of *why*, *how*, *when* or *if*.

As :ref:`language <language>` evolves, its progression into abstraction is apparaent. The correspondence between the signifier and the signified is almost entirely severed as linguistic forms accumulate syntactic functions and these functions become the bearers of meaning beyond the directly indicative; Language is no longer a direct mapping between object and sign. The `following diagram <https://www.britannica.com/topic/writing/Sumerian-writing>`_ shows the evolution of cunieform, from simple pictograms to abstract symbols,

.. image:: ../_static/img/context/anthropological/cuneiform-evolution.jpg
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Encyclopedia Britannica Cuneiform Table
   :align: center

The lefthand column pictograms are clearly direct representations of the underlying concept, a visual analogue of reality. The grammar of such a system cannot help being analogical by mimicking the perceived the relations of reality through their direct image in writing. There is no other way to represent relations except spatially, i.e. by placing the symbol for "*foot*" next to the symbol for "*road*" to indicate the action of "*walking*". Actions, and the complex relations which factor into motive forms, are reduced to the aggregation of their constituent objects.

This type of representation offers little in the way of symbolically presenting the internal state of a human. There is no way to conceive of "*self*" in a pictographic system, because a "*self*" cannot be represented graphically. In other words, the "*self*" never sees itself because it is the thing that *sees*. The conceptualization of "*self*" requires semantic features this form of :ref:`language <language>` does not possess.

.. topic:: Conjecture

    Early creation myths are records of the transformation every :ref:`language <language>` must undergo to provide the linguistic apparatus for progressing from purely visual and analogical to the abstract and metaphorical. Creation myths are literal linguistic artifacts of early humans attempting (or inventing the terms) to describe the transformation they were undergoing, from a form of consciousness primarily grounded in immediate perception and external representation to a form of highly symbolic abstraction that allows (or induces) a conceptualization of "*self*".

The sheer breadth of history that separates the current time period from the moment when creation myths were actually written precludes any positive verification of this claim, so all evidence will necessarily be circumstantial. Bearing that in mind, a particularly compelling piece of evidence for this claim is demonstrated in *Exodus 3:14*, when Moses asks for the name of God to give to his people. God replies,

    אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה

    Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh

This phrase presents significant challenges when translated into modern English. It is often rendered as one of the following,

    I am who I am

    I am that I am

    I will be what I will be

    I am the being
 
    I am the one who is

These translations are influenced and constrainted by the historical trajectory of the Torah through Greek and Latin cultures. When translated into the Greek Septuagint, the original Hebrew phrase became,

    Ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ὤν

The Greek Septuagint introduced a definite article in the form of "*ὁ*" and a personal first person in "*Ἐγώ*" in order to reconstruct the perceived meaning of Ancient Hebrew within Koine Greek. More fundamental, it translated "*אֶהְיֶה (ehyeh)*" into the present tense of "*εἰμι (eimi)*". The effects have been passed down to present day translations like King James. However, the original meaning of the "*Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh*" is not entirely captured by any of these translations.

Ancient Hebrew did not have a modality for time. Its verbs were given aspects, but not temporality. A Hebrew verb has a *perfect* aspect and an *imperfect* aspect. The *perfect* aspect denotes completed or singular actions. This is sometimes called the *gnomic* mode or tense. In English, some examples are given in the following,

- It has been decided.
- The sun rises.
- The birds are fast.

However, these statements, while exhibiting *perfect* aspect, by their instantiation in English, are necessarily inflected with temporality, e.g. "*rises*" or "*has been*". Again, it is crucial to note Ancient Hebrew did not have this modality.

The *imperfect* aspect denotes an incomplete, ongoing or potential action. In English, some examples are given,

- They will go.
- The bird sings every morning.
- The store used to be open.

"*אֶהְיֶה (ehyeh)*" is the first person singular imperfect form of "*הָיָה (hayah)*", which translate into "*to be*", "*to become*", "*to exist*". "*אֶהְיֶה (ehyeh)*" is the Ancient Hebrew concept of :ref:`being <being>`.

"*אֲשֶׁר (asher)*" is a linguistic relativizer, analogous to the English "*that*" or "*which*". A relativizer plays a role not dissimilar to the role of quantification in symbolic logic, in that it provides conditions for its clause to obtain, i.e.,

- the lady from Chicago that sang a tune.
- the brown dog which ran away.
- the man that wasn't there.

These examples show the function of a relativizer is to qualify its clauses. With these facts in mind, the literal English translation of "*אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה*" is,

    am that am

    am which am

The question then becomes in what *mode* to interpret the "*am*", i.e. as a potentiality, a habituality or ongoing process. Regardless, taken in conjunction with the previous conjecture, God's reply to Moses appears to identify divinity itself with the conjugation of :ref:`being <being>` into its *imperfect first person modality* of "*am*". Moreover, that :ref:`being <being>` is qualified relative to itself.

.. topic:: Conjecture

    Early humans did not have the concept of "*self*" until :ref:`language <language>` had evolved to the point where abstraction, complex predication and metaphor was possible.

It is easy to be fooled by the apparent continuity of our "*self*" through time and space that consciousness is a single thing, everywhere equivalent in its multiplicity. We assume our consciousness is in every way identical to every other, except for its particular circumstances, that we might substitute our "*self*" into another's without alteration. That no one remembers their birth or early youth except in fragments is dismissed because however blurry the memory, we remember our self ":ref:`being there <being>`". We don't account for the role that :ref:`language <language>` plays in the development of our "*self*". Humans are essentially vessels for :ref:`language <language>`. Our earliest records are (*allegedly*) suffused with the history of consciousness itself.

If the conjecture is granted, the question remains: what is the "*self*"? How does the modality of "*am*" that evolved from the concept of :ref:`being` allow the "*self*" to take root? Is the "*self*" created or described by this evolution of :ref:`language <language>`? Conceding to the ever present specter of uncerainty, the question is essentially: does :ref:`language <language>` *induce* self-awareness or does it provide the formal framework for its interpretation?

It is instructive to consider the history of the *proposition*, for the *proposition* is at once a sentence and a unit of mathematics, i.e. a :ref:`truth value <truth-values>`. The proposition is a both a *meaningful* thing and a *formal* thing. The history of philosophy and mathematics is, by and large, an analysis and gradual unveiling of the relations that bind *form* to *meaning*, *syntax* to *semantics*. It is therefore, fundamentally, a history of contradiction and paradox.

    Heidegger would call this translation *latinized*, and point out the components underlying the meaning of *οὐσία*. *οὐσία* is derived from the feminine present participle of *εἶναι* (*to be*), *οὖσα*, but it is also etymologically related to *παρουσία* (*being-at, present*). Heidegger would likely contend the translation of *οὐσία* is better served by the term "*presence*".

Aristotle regarded a :ref:`proposition <proposition>` as a representation of :ref:`being <being>`, and thought of the syntax of :ref:`propositions <proposition>` as manifestations of the different *categories* of :ref:`being <being>`. Aristotle's ontology regarded :ref:`being <being>` as a relationship of predication that ultimately resolved to a category predicated of the primitive subject, termed the "*οὐσία*" (often translated as *substance*). Aristotle defined the nature of the predicative relations in `Categories`_, summarized below,

1. Substance (*οὐσία*): What something fundamentally is.
2. Quantity (*ποσόν*): How much or how many of the subtance exists.
3. Quality (*ποιόν*): What kind or sort of thing a substance is.
4. Relation (*πρός τι*): How a substance stands in reference to another substance.
5. Place (*ποῦ*): Where the substance is located.
6. Time (*πότε*): When the substance exists.
7. Position (*κεῖσθαι*): The physical arrangement of the substance's parts.
8. State (*ἔχειν*): The condition or state of having something.
9. Action (*ποιεῖν*): What the substance is actively doing.
10. Passion (*πάσχειν*): What is being done to the substance.

Aristotle viewed the predication of a category as applying to either the entire *οὐσία*, a part of the *οὐσία* or none of the *οὐσία*. Modern :ref:`logic <logic>` tends to view this as the equivalent of :ref:`quantification <logical-quantification>`, but as Peter Abelard pointed out (see below) this type *Aristotelian* :ref:`quantification <logical-quantification>` has important differences that are not present in its modern descendant. These differences are themselves rooted in the *lack* of material difference in the ancient concepts of :ref:`logic <logic>` and ontology; when Aristotle is expounding his :ref:`logic <logic>` in `Prior Analytics`_, he is not making formal (*syntactic*, :ref:`tautological <tautologies>`) arguments, he is making ontological (*semantic*, *interpretative*) arguments. This becomes clear when he "*proves*" his syllogistic figures by appeal to ordered triplets of *things*. (TODO: example here)

The division of :ref:`logic <logic>` and ontology into separate domains of discourse did not occur until much later, its beginnings emerging approximately in parallel with the Renaisannce era, when figures like Boole began to probe and map the formal properties of :ref:`logic <logic>`, eventually leading to successive revolutions of Frege, Russell, Gödel and Tarski, which effectively isolated :ref:`logic <logic>` from ontology by reducing the subject's presence in the ancient science to the role of interpretation. 

.. sidebar::

    Badiou's pronouncement, `mathematics is ontology <Being and Event>`_ is an attempt to return ontology to formal discourse. However, as this essay will argue, his pronouncement is *essentially* incorrect. Mathematics is *metaphysics*, or atleast as close as a subject can get without thereby becoming it. 

In the modern conception of :ref:`logic <logic>`, the subject's role lies in finding a real world model that *satifies* the syntactical properties of the formal model under the assignment (indexing) of empirical objects to the symbolic terms of the :ref:`language <language>`. The formal model has no responsibility to comport itself towards :ref:`being <being>` real; the one interpretting the model must find its coherent interpretation in reality. A significant portion of modern mathematics is nothing more than the production of formal theorems unanchored by empirical reality, often justified by appeal to other instances of theoretical constructs finding unintended interpretations, e.g. the axioms of probability in geometric proportions, imaginary numbers in engineering applications, etc. The *intension* of :ref:`Aristotelian logic <aristotelian-logic>`, however, is to explicitly elaborate the structure of :ref:`being <being>`, first and foremost.

However, within the :ref:`logic <logic>` of Aristotle, there is a subtle flaw which betokens why :ref:`logic <logic>` and :ref:`language <language>` must remain incapable of an equivalency with :ref:`being <being>`. In `Prior Analytics`_, Aristotle often uses what he termed a "*positive conversion*" from a universally affirmed premise to particular premise,

.. epigraph::

    The positive premise necessarily converts, thought not universally but in part. For instance, if every pleasure is a good, then some good will be a pleasure.

    -- `Prior Analytics`_, Aristotle

If the statement "*all B are A*" is rendered as :math:`AaB` and "*some B are A*" as :math:`AiB`, a positive conversion of a premise can be formalized as, 

.. math::
    
    AaB \to AiB

Aristotle also applied particular conversions,

.. math::

    AiB \to BiA

Which is to say, if "*some B is A*" is true, then "*some A is B*" is also true, the classic example cited above in this instance becoming "*if some pleasure is good, then some good is pleasure*". These two conversions [#may_2025_01]_ form the core of Aristotle's deductive calculus. Aristotle viewed a deduction (*συλλογισμός*) as a ontological rule where two categorical premises implied a categorical conclusion. The classic *Barbara* deduction (the "*first figure*", as Aristotle called it) is formalized as, 

.. math::

    AaB, BaC \vdash AaC

Which is rendered into English as, 

    If all B are A and all C are B, then all C are A.

Where :math:`A`, :math:`B` and :math:`C` represent *genera* and *species* of *οὐσία*, for example, *animal*, *man* and *husband*. Aristotle often proves these "*figures*" of deduction by applying a positive universal conversion, as in his proof of the *Darapti* deduction, 

.. math::
    
    PaS, RaS \vdash PiS

.. epigraph::

    When both P and R belong to every S, it results of necessity that P will belong to some R. For since the positive premise converts, S will belong to some R; consequently, since P belongs to every S and S to some R, it is necessary for P to belong to some R (for a deduction through the first figure comes about).

    -- `Prior Analytics`_, Aristotle

The deduction rule :math:`AaB \to AiB` is often termed a deduction of *existential import*, for it implicitly assumes the existence of its premise. Abelard brought this subtle fallacy to light in his *Dialectica*,

.. epigraph::

    If '*every stone-man is a stone*' is true, also its conversion per accidens is true ('*some stones are stone-men*'). But no stone is a stone-man, because neither this man nor that man etc. is a stone. But also this '*a certain stone-man is not a stone*' is false by necessity, since it is impossible to suppose it is true.

    -- Dialectica, Abelard

What Abelard is pointing out is a notion that would not be formalized for another millenia in the strictures of set theory: unrestricted comprehension of an abstraction principle necessarily leads to contradiction. The proposition, "*all stone men are stone*", can be true, syntactically speaking, when no objects exist in the domain that is being quantified, namely "*stone men*". As a consequence, because "*all stone men are stone*" can be true without referring to any actual :ref:`beings <being>`, it is too much to grant a deduction from the universal assertion to a particular instance of a "*stone man*". In other words, "*all*" does not imply "*some*" if nothing exists to satisfy "*all*"; indeed, "*all*" must be conditioned on a presupposed existent *thing*. 

The essential fallacy committed by Aristotle is supposing :ref:`language <language>` can represent reality with perfect fidelity. The crux of Abelard's criticism is found in how Aristotle transforms an argument into symbolic abstractions, manipulates the abstractions through an algebra and then transforms the result back into the original :ref:`language <language>` to obtain the conclusion. Aristotle supposes one can assign symbols to things and then map the actual relations that obtain between the things onto the syntactic rules that connect the symbols. Once this assignment is made, he supposes the result obtained through symbolic deduction is equivalent to the actual conclusion, where each application of a rule (e.g. a conversion) in the deductive chain corresponds to some actual thought process that would occur were it (the thought process) to consider the argument on its own terms.  

At this point, one might assume, as humans did, it is merely a lack of precision that prevents Aristotle's ontology from expressing the true relations of :ref:`being <being>`. However, the inability of :ref:`language <language>` to penetrate :ref:`being <being>` is the perennial problem of philosophy. Again and again, age after age, it is supposed the nature of :ref:`being <being>` can be reduced to words. The history of logic and the proposition is the history of a losing war. Each time, armies are raised, cloaked in ever more complex machinery. The battles become more sophiscated and harder to follow, but the outcome is always the same. The human mind falters in its approach and discovers another layer of contradiction encircling its thoughts. 

In the late nineteenth century, the most sustained and protracted campaigns of this war, up to that point in history, was waged by Frege's `Grundgesetze Der Arithmetik`_ . In this sprawling and dense work, Frege target was the language of arithmetic, which contains such statement as "*all numbers have a successor*" or symbollically in modern notation,

.. math::
    
    a \in \mathbb{N} \implies a + 1 \in \mathbb{N}

His goal was to show this :ref:`language <language>` was derived from the more fundamental :ref:`language <language>` of :ref:`logic <logic>` through definition and deduction. In effect, Frege sought to show, using precise :ref:`language <language>` lacking any ambiguity, the essential nature of numbers was logical. 

To see how the conundrum of existence and :ref:`language <language>` ruptures Frege's :ref:`logic <logic>` from the inside out, one must understand how 
Frege departed from the Aristotelian model of :ref:`logic <logic>`. Frege conceived of a proposition *extensionally*, as opposed to *categorically*. To Frege, a proposition is a formula that is *satisfied* by certain objects. For example, ":math:`x` *is even*" is a proposition *satisfied* by the series of numbers :math:`0, 2, 4, ...`; Frege thought of each proposition as implicitly expressing the relation of "*belonging*" between an object :math:`x` and a (*value-range or extension of a*) concept :math:`\hat{\epsilon}f`, where the relation is manifested through a property predicated of each object that belongs to the concept. In other words, Frege saw *predication* as being equivalent to *abstraction*.

For example, to say in Fregean terms, "*this pen belongs to the concept of Black*" is equivalent to saying "*this pen is a black object*". Note in these examples the division between the near-Platonic formal nature of "*Black*" and the near-Aristotelian predication of "*black*". The use of capitalization is intentional, for Frege would call "*Black*" a proper name and "*black*" a description. According to Frege, *Black* is the abstract concept common to all instances of *black* things. In other words, Frege has committed himself to a stance on the problem of universals, namely that they exist. 

Moreover, Fregean concepts exist as *terms* in the language from which they arose as abstractions. Frege asserted, for all objects :math:`x`, the property :math:`f` being equal to the property :math:`g` is equivalent to saying the concept :math:`\hat{\epsilon}f` and the concept :math:`\hat{\epsilon}g` are the same concept,

.. math::

    (\forall x: f(x) \equiv g(x)) \equiv (\hat{\epsilon}f = \hat{\epsilon}g)

The righthand side of this equivalency treats the concepts  :math:`\hat{\epsilon}f` and :math:`\hat{\epsilon}g` as operands in an equality relation, which to say, it treats concepts *as objects in the language of* `Grundgesetze der Arithmetik`_. This :ref:`axiom <frege-axioms>` was called *Law V* by Frege. 

Note this formulation is symmetrical and complementary with the logical law, first posited by Leibniz and adopted by Frege in his `Grundgesetze Der Arithmetik`_, that if two objects have the same properties, they are identical (often known as the Law of Indiscernibles),

.. math::

    \forall a, b: (\forall f: f(a) \equiv f(b)) \equiv (a = b) 

However, instead of quantifying over objects and passing into conceptuality, the Law of Indiscernibles passes into objectivity by quantifying over properties (i.e. abstractions). In other words, the Law of Indiscernible states for all possible properties that can be asserted of two objects, if and only if the objects are the same will all of the asserted properties of those objects be equivalent [#may_2025_02]_. On the other hand, Frege's Law V states, for *all objects*, if and only if the (*extensions of*) concepts are the same will the asserted properties to those concepts be equivalent.

The Law of Indiscernibles qualifies abstractions in their totality and passes into an assertion of equality between the objects which originate the abstraction, whereas Frege's Law V qualifies objects in their totality and then passes into an assertion of equality between their abstractions. Crucially, the Law of Indiscernibles can be *vacuously true*, as in the case of :math:`f` representing such properties as the predicate of "*being impredicable*". However, the quantification in Frege's Law V is *existentially* important for all but the *null* domain; Frege's Law V *assumes the existence of the object being quantified*.

To draw to the surface the lurking shadow of Abelard's stone men from Frege's Law V, and reveal the formal structure of contradiction in Frege's `Grundgesetze Der Arithmetik`_, the notion of "*an object* :math:`x` *belonging to a concept* :math:`\hat{\epsilon}`" must be defined [#may_2025_03]_,

.. math::

    x \frown \hat{\epsilon}f \equiv \exists \phi: (\hat{\epsilon}f = \hat{\epsilon}\phi) \land \phi(x)

That is, asserting :math:`x` *belongs* :math:`\hat{\epsilon}f` is equivalent to asserting there exists a property :math:`\phi` of :math:`x` (denoted :math:`\phi(x)`) *and* the concept (value-range) of :math:`\phi` is equal to :math:`\hat{\epsilon}f` (the concept or value range of :math:`f`). [#may_2025_04]_ It is rightly stated by Frege's commentators that Law V leads directly to the contradiction of Russell's Paradox. This is true, but the manner in which this contradiction arises is often not appreciated. The origin of Russell's Paradox in Frege's system is the existential and creative nature of his definition of membership, :math:`\frown`. From this definition, Law V is used to show,

.. math::

    x \frown \hat{\epsilon}f \equiv f(x)

Which is to say, the assertion of :math:`x` belonging to a concept :math:`\hat{\epsilon}f` is equivalent to the assertion :math:`x` has property :math:`f`. From here, it is a simple matter of letting :math:`f` be the property of not belonging to concept :math:`\hat{\epsilon}f`,

.. math::

    f(x) = \neg (x \frown \hat{\epsilon}f)

Whence the famed Russell's Paradox emerges,

.. math::

    x \frown \hat{\epsilon}f \equiv \neg (x \frown \hat{\epsilon}f)

Clearly, this should not be the case. Historically speaking, this annihiliated Frege's logicist project, but the nature of the deduction which leads to this annihiliation would be the primary motive for the formal insights of Russell and Tarski. To show more clearly how this contradiction arises, consider the following  proof of one direction of :math:`x \frown \hat{\epsilon}f \equiv f(x)`.

Assume :math:`x \frown \hat{\epsilon}f`. 

From the definition of membership, there is a property :math:`\phi(x)` and the concept of this property :math:`\hat{\epsilon}\phi` is equal to the concept of :math:`f`, :math:`\hat{\epsilon{f}}`. 

The question, often known as the *Caesar Problem*, is how does one re-identify the property :math:`\phi` with the property :math:`f`? This is where Frege's Law V comes in; since the definition of membership yields the equality of concepts, Frege's Law V allows the deduction to pass into the equivalence of properties,

.. math::

    \phi(x) = f(x) 

Therefore, if :math:`x \frown \hat{\epsilon}f`, then :math:`f(x)`.

The key step is passing from the universal equality of concepts, an assertion of categorical relation, to an *instance* of the property denoted by the concept. Frege makes the same mistake as Aristotle (:small:`good company to keep`) in assuming a universal relation implies an existential relation.

    For the sake of greater perspicuity, we shall use the symbol '*c*' as a typographical abbreviations of the expression '*the sentence printed on this page, line 5 from the top*'. Consider now the following sentence:

        *c is not a true sentence*  (Note: this sentence is typeset on line 5)

    Having regard to the meaning of the symbol 'c', we can establish empirically:

        1. 'c is not a true sentence' is identical with *c*

    For the quotation-mark name of the sentence *c* (or for any other of its names), we can set up an explanation of type:

        2. 'c is not a true sentence' is a true sentence if and only c is not a true sentence.

    The premises 1 and 2 together at once give a contradiction:

        c is a true sentence if and only if c is not a true sentence.

    - `The Concept of Truth in Formalized Languages`_, Alfred Tarski

From this, Tarski concludes that "*colloquial* :ref:`language <language>`" is hopelessly inconsistent. :ref:`Truth <truth>` *about* a :ref:`language <language>` never exists *within* that language. Tarski is saying, in the mathematically ineluctable way of *proof by contradiction*, that by assuming ":ref:`language <language>`" is a singular entity where all descriptions occur on the same level, contradictions necessarily result. Therefore, to salvage the concept of ":ref:`truth <truth>`", Tarski famously introduces the distinction between *meta* :ref:`language <language>` and *object* :ref:`language <language>`,

.. epigraph::

    For this reason, when we investigate the :ref:`language <language>` of a formalized deductive science, we must always distinguish clearly between the :ref:`language <language>` *about* which we speak and the :ref:`language <language>` *in* which we speak, as well as between the science which is the object of our investigation and the science in which the investigation is being carried out. The names of the expressions of the first language, and of the relations between them, belong to the second language, called the *meta* :ref:`language <language>` (which may contain the first as a part). The description of these expressions, the definition of the complicated concepts, especially of those connected with the construction of a deductive theory (like the concept of consequence, of provable sentence, possibly of true sentence), the determiniation of the properties of these concepts, is the task of the second theory which we shall call the *metatheory*.

    - `The Concept of Truth in Formalized Languages`_, Alfred Tarski

In other words, the notion of "*truth*" requires a bifurcation of :ref:`language <language>`. If we want the discourse to include predicates of "*is true*" or "*is false*", :ref:`language <language>` cannot be treated as one cohesive unit, where these assertions are carried out in the same :ref:`language <language>` in which what is being asserted *is asserted*. This idea is only strange if :ref:`language <language>` is regarded as something fixed and determinate. However, it is more apt to think of :ref:`language <language>` as a *continuous process that accumulates components of orthogonal meaning over time*. Each syntactic construct allows new semantic meaning to be encoded into the artifice of :ref:`language <language>`, and each new semantic concept integrated into the fabric of :ref:`language <language>` alters what is demarcated by its boundaries. In other words, :ref:`language <language>` can only be conceived of as a whole at certain points in time, when its definitions are fixed by their factical origin in the world. But the cross section of :ref:`language <language>` at any given moment does not capture its dynamic nature across time; in fact, this nontemporal model of :ref:`language <language>` fails to represent in any capacity beyond the formal the essential nature of :ref:`language <language>`.

Tarski's parsimony of meta and object :ref:`language <language>` shows that ":ref:`truth <truth>`" represents one of these transformative concepts that alters the very constitution of :ref:`language <language>` through its introduction and analysis. In essence, the concept of ":ref:`truth <truth>`", through its rigorous integration into the corpus of :ref:`language <language>`, creates a schism in :ref:`language <language>`. If we allow ourselves to accept ":ref:`truth <truth>`" as a meaningful construct, then we must accept this molecular division of :ref:`language <language>` into separate, but related, domains.

.. important::

    It should be noted this division is only necessary if one concedes to the premise that contradictions should not be syntactically expressible within a :ref:`language <language>`.

The apparent *incompleteness* of :ref:`language <language>`, i.e. its inability to be fully reduced to formal representation, arises because we each view words and sentences as a representative instances plucked from the supposed totality of :ref:`language <language>`. But Tarski has shown, by revealing the circular logic of :ref:`truth <truth>`, that :ref:`language <language>` *is not a totality* and any attempt to treat it as such will result in contradiction.

.. epigraph::

    Vicious circles arise from supposing that a collection of objects may contain members which can only be defined by means of the collection as a whole. Thus, for example, the collection of propositions will be supposed to contain a proposition stating that "*all propositions are either true or false.*” It would seem, however, that such a statement could not be legitimate unless “*all propositions*” referred to some already definite collection, which it cannot do if new propositions are created by statements about “*all propositions*”. We shall, therefore, have to say that statements about “*all propositions*” are meaningless. More generally, given any set of objects such that, if we suppose the set to have a total, it will contain members which presuppose this total, then such a set cannot have a total. By saying that a set has “*no total*,” we mean, primarily, that no significant statement can be made about “*all its members.*”

    - `Principia Mathematica`_, Bertrand Russell and Alfred Whitehead

We say, "*this word is* :ref:`language <language>`" or "*this sentence is* :ref:`language <language>`", having misunderstood what is designated by the term ":ref:`language`". We view :ref:`language <language>` as a *structure*, as a collection extensionally determined by its members, instead of a *structuring*, as the *intension* which composes the determination. *Structures* must possess parts in determinate relations, whereas *structuring* is the very process by which parts are arranged into and imbued with *structure*. In other words, the predicate "*is* :ref:`language`", like the predicates "*is true*" or "*is false*", never occurs within :ref:`language <language>`, but indicates a rupture in the foundations of :ref:`language <language>`. This rupture *is* the essence of :ref:`language <language>`, to bring within its field of containment something entirely disparate from its other elements.

.. epigraph::

    Ask yourself whether our :ref:`language <language>` is complete-—whether it was so before the symbolism of chemistry and the notation of the infinitesimal calculus were incorporated in it; for these are, so to speak, suburbs of our :ref:`language <language>`. (And how many houses or streets does it take before a town begins to be a town?) Our :ref:`language <language>` can be seen as an ancient city: a maze of little streets and squares, of old and new houses, and of houses with additions from various periods; and this surrounded by a multitude of new boroughs with straight regular streets and uniform houses.

    -- `Philosophical Investigations`_, Ludwig Wittenstein

Ask yourself: What do "*equals*", "*or*" and "*all*" have in common beyond their inclusion in :ref:`language <language>`? All three serve distinct linguistic functions, that of identity, disjunction and categorical assertion respectively. They are employed a certain way, to encode meaning a certain way. They have no commonality beyond being :ref:`language <language>`. To call "*these words*" :ref:`language <language>` is directly analogous to collecting an abacus, a paint brush and a hammer under the header of a single concept. The way an abacus is engaged in action and the meaning of its movements, is vastly and materially different than the action and movement of a hammer or paintbrush.

In Tarski's conception, :ref:`truth <truth>` is a property expressed in the meta :ref:`language <language>`, *not* the object :ref:`language <language>`. When the :ref:`assignment <value-assignment>` of values to the terms of the object :ref:`language <language>` satisfies a :ref:`proposition <proposition>` of the meta :ref:`language <language>` for all possible :ref:`assignments <value-assignment>`, then the result is said "*to be true*". Tarski defines :ref:`truth <truth>` relative to the combinatorial totality of value assignments. :ref:`Truth <truth>` is the semantic locus point of *syntactic satisfaction* across all possible interpretations.

:ref:`Set theory <sets>` is a formal system that is often used as a meta :ref:`language <language>` in mathematics to specify the conditions of object :ref:`languages <language>`, e.g. differential and integral calculus, real and complex analysis, etc. In many ways, :ref:`set theory <sets>` is the formal crystallization of the logical dialectic initiated by Aristotle in the Organon. :ref:`Axiomatic set theory <sets>`, in its various formulations, represents the purely symbolic and syntactic limit of categorical logic, the maximum extent to which language can be shaped by formal considerations. In doing so, it must restrict itself to the *metalogical* layer, never penetrating below the surface of description.

When language ceases, so does life. 

We spend our childhoods learning how to speak, threading our souls with symbols. Language acqusition is like a spell, a black magic ritual that induces in us the world. We are spoken into existence. Our lives are lived through the medium of speech.

All of these concepts accumulated through history, flowing into our heads through the currents of time, met in the external source of the world which unfolds in our senses. One marvels at the complexity. So many facts, shot through and through with interpretations. So many accidents and contingencies, indistinguishable in their effects. 

In the murky factical origins of language, nothing is certain, but somethings are more certain than others. One cannot imagine a world without community. The self implies a multiplicity of selves. We must be bootstrapped with language, taught through ostension the ways in which things can relate to another, before the self as a concept may emerge as a relata within a relation, and this cannot happen without someone to draw attention to the ways in which symbols may represent that latent potential lurking. The "*self*" must be taught to us; it is an evolution of abstraction transmitted through language that manifests in our phenomenological life, in a directly analogous fashion to the way chains of DNA manifest phenotypes. The "*syntax*" of amino acids encodes the potentialites of life; the raw struggle of existence dictates which potentialities are activated, i.e. the "*semantics*" of DNA are determined by the ways in which the phenotypes interact with the existent world. 

It is hard to imagine how a newborn infant could contain the potential for language, except through the possibility of absorbing it from another human. Language is only innate to the extent that is a potential of the human mind (and only then, at crucial periods during the development of the organism, as the case of feral children implies).

Consider the two substantially different questions: Who was the first human to be named? What was their name? Now consider that, whatever the answer to these questions might be, the literal answer (i.e. the series of characters) is the same each case, but what is denoted by the answer is not. 

In the first case, the answer to the question refers to the bearer of the name. In the second, it refers to the name itself. In other words, a name enables (formal) identity, but a name is *not* the same as (formal) identity. Or to be a finer linguistic point on it: a name is not identical to identity. 

Tarski tells us names do not exist on the same logical level as the :ref:`language <language>` in which the named things are used. A name is not an object; The name of a thing is a different type of thing than the thing itself. 

Obviously, the name itself does not matter, as any symbol whatsoever can stand in place of a thing. In Tarski's view, "*A contains B*" is the name of the sentence: A contains B. But this is only a matter of convention, albeit a deceptive convention that masks the nature of naming. We can as well agree to call the symbol :math:`ᛉ` the name of the sentence: A contains B. Tarski, instead of assigning arbitrary symbols to a name, expressed the name of a symbolic proposition with another symbolic proposition,

    ":math:`B \subset A`" if and only if A contains B. 

This process of naming has no limit,

    "":math:`B \subset A`" if and only if A contains B." if and only if ":math:`B \subset A`" if and only if A contains B. 

Language does not seem possible without admitting that it's nature is inextricably tied to the phenomenon of naming, and naming is not a coherent phenomenon unless language is allowed an infinite regress, forever synthesizing names and names of names and names of names of names and ...
