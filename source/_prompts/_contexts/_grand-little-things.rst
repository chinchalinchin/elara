.. # SOLICITATION: GRAND LITTLE THINGS
.. 
.. “The fact is that no form belongs inevitably with any theme or attitude; no form is good or appropriate in itself, but any form can be made good by able hands.” – Richard Wilbur
..
.. Grand Little Things is a journal that embraces versification, lyricism, and formal poetry that focuses on anything, be it the expanse between the minutia of everyday life, to revelations on how we got here or why we use a thing called language. Grand concepts like spirituality, reality, existence are welcomed. So are little things like emotions and human relationships. Or maybe you write about nature? GLT wants to read all formal poems, be they grand like the sestina or little, like the couplet.
.. 
.. GLT caters to formalistic, stylized poetry, but it is welcome to invented/nonce forms as well. Heck, as long as there is a strong sense of versification – does the poem sing? Is the imagery vivid and serves a purpose? Does the poem have meaning? Or does it do away with such concepts? – it will be considered. However, GLT is not the best place for experimental poetry.
..
.. Language is small. It’s just markings that we’ve assigned meaning to. However, that meaning fills the entirety of our universe.
..
.. Also, Grand Little Things is open to new writers – meaning you don’t have any publication credits – as well as emerging or established writers. Feel free to submit!
..
.. GLT is looking for formal poetry, be it a tried and true form or an invented/nonce form. Blank and free verse will also be considered, assuming there are other aspects of standard versification.
..
.. This means that GLT will read things like the sonnet, metrical poetry, lyric poetry, narrative poetry, haiku, villanelle, etc. And just to reiterate: if your poem doesn’t fall into such stringent guidelines, BUT has a strong sense of versification, it will be considered.
..
.. Grand Little Things does not publish previously published work. This includes work that has appeared on other blogs or social media sites.
.. 
.. Feel free to send up to three poems at a time in a single file. Please ensure that the file is saved in a DOC., DOCX., or RTF or any other Microsoft Word related format. Don’t send a PDF. Include your name as well as a short 3rd person bio (50-100 words). Simultaneous submissions are welcome.
.. 
.. Poems shall be published based on a rolling basis. I will try to have a response sent back in 5-6 months. If I can respond sooner, I shall.
..
.. Allow up to 5 months before querying however.
..
.. First time publication rights will belong to Grand Little Things, but all rights will revert to the author after it is published.
.. 
.. Submissions are free. This is a labor of love (which means that there will not be any monetary payment if you’re published).
.. 
.. I’m interested in creating a space for new and emerging writers. However, if you are popular and you want to help spread said popularity, that’s cool.

.. # RANDOM POEMS FROM THEIR ISSUES
..
.. What Moves Us
..
.. Designs for towns, these places usually move
.. to the sounds of the river, the constant rushing
.. Expansion of soil or retracting floods, prove
.. the diligence of generations in pasts brushing
..
.. Generations working the water and wind
.. People moving with the river or air
.. Of all the time we could possibly spend
.. planting roots or moving freely, neither seems fair
.. 
.. The elements skirting the delinquence of wild
.. Constant fervor in the need to depart or stay
.. Sky lifting across the horizons in a smile
.. could care less for either calamity or fray
.. 
.. Indifferent natures, we seek what pleases
.. Become part of any landscape or change with seasons
..

..
.. Sing
..
.. If you can hear me
.. on a winding thread of light
.. grab a can and sing
.. from the moon tides to the shore
.. phosphorescence you will bring

.. No Street by Which You Might Return
..
.. Most any day you’d take your walk -
.. Sometimes the dogwoods were in bloom,
.. Or sometimes in a winter gloom -
.. You’d linger with some friend and talk.
..
.. Our streets were safe, but even so
.. If you walked on and on too long,
.. I’d fear there might be something wrong
.. And where I thought you’d gone, I’d go.
.. 
.. Now sometimes absentmindedly
.. I wait to hear you at the door;
.. I listen for your voice once more;
.. I wait for what can never be;
..
.. Forgetting that there is no street,
.. Now, by which you might return,   
.. No friend to tell where you have gone,
.. No corner now where we might meet.
.. 
.. And should you wander tired and sore
.. Down endless streets beneath dark skies  
.. Beyond the lamps of paradise,
.. I can’t come find you anymore.

.. Hyades
..
.. Where are you now? When night by night goes by, 
.. And all I have are memories and dreams—
.. Of rainy scenes of you in late July,
.. Unmoved by all that acts, but only seems,
.. And never is what it may seem. I ask:
.. The meaning of your kiss. Of death, or life?—
.. A question? Or love?—All I serve, and task
.. Myself to tend this care, as would my wife
.. Tend mine.—And like a faithful wife, you stayed 
.. My gait through troubled times of need and loss,
.. Which still today burn bright, and do not fade 
.. Or wash away, like stars that never cross.
.. 	They form a double fact: that you are you,
..  And everywhere you are, there I am, too.
