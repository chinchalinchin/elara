.. MODE: OVERRIDE
..
.. This document contains a collection of poetry and my resume. This comment contains a solitication from a journal and some context surrounding the journal. The goal is to find the most likely poems to be published in the given solicitation. Use the context to create a taste profile of the journal. Select poems from the collection below that meet the this profile. If there are none, say so. If a submission is possible, create a cover for the letter submission and any other additional material (biography, etc) the solitication requires for submission.
..
.. The collection also contains submission histories. Use this data to influence your decision, i.e. take into account the number of rejections and allow it to update your posterior probabilities about the likelihood of getting published.

.. # SOLICITATION: THE AFTERSHOCK REVIEW
.. 
.. The Aftershock Review is a poetry magazine committed to showcasing exceptional work that grapples with trauma in its many forms. But this isn’t about catharsis—it’s about great poetry. We believe that poems about trauma don’t have to be traumatic. They can be nuanced, tender, sharp, or even playful. Above all, they should push the boundaries of language and form, showing us what poetry can do.
.. 
.. Our mission is to become a leading publication for poetry that examines the aftershocks of lived experience with precision, imagination, and artistic integrity. We look for work that challenges the narrative of trauma as simply pain and explores it as a complex force that shapes, complicates, and enriches human life.
..
.. We believe that poetry has the power to transform how we see the world—and ourselves.
..
.. "After almost dying, there was only one option in front of me: to survive. But not just that, to thrive. This is a celebration of that. This is my manifesto for living. With over 40 confirmed names, our lineup is wildly inclusive and diverse, featuring individuals aged 17 to 93. It includes multinational poets, as well as those who are disabled, neurodiverse, LGBTQ+, and represent all income strata.
.. 
.. We also have BIPOC voices, voices from those who have lived with psychosis, and people who have been affected by terminal illnesses in their lives as well as those with other hidden disabilities among our contributors.
.. 
.. I believe these are voices that need to be heard.
.. 
.. Their poetry is proof of that."
