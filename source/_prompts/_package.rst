Our Story Unfolded

Neon & Smoke is a home for bold, voice-driven fiction with emotional weight and narrative fire.

We publish stories that don’t sit quietly—tales where the plot might thrill, chill, or make you laugh, but always reveals something deeper. We crave characters who leap off the page, language that crackles, and stories that blur the line between genre and literary not for the sake of novelty, but it’s the most honest way to tell the truth.  

We want poems that make ritual burn on the page. Sacred or profane, tender or destructive — show us traditions, habits, obsessions, or cycles that bind, break, or transform. Surprise us with what counts as ritual in your world. All voices welcome.

Feel free to submit up to two pieces - 60 lines or 600 words.

**Holly Tree**

Under the holly tree
bough of berries,
its siren red
temptation.

Where life began
on skinny knees
retching out
my guts.

Waxy saw-tooth skin,
prickly leaves,
the sickly buds
of poison seeds.

The tangy tongue
of Christmas
funerary rites.

I spewed
through chrysalis,
entrails slick
with acid grease,
thickly dripping
afterbirth.

Gazed upon by
ageless tree,
received in holy
communion, my first
memory:

The pluming rack
of tight blue
veins
that hung about
my neck.

The womb of black
that forked
the branching
Earth.

The world that hid
in bitter leaves
and pushed me
into it.

I made a wreath
of holly limbs
to prick my head
with thoughts.

I keep its berries
bright as death
and touch the skin
that baptized
me.

**Faustus**


crooked cross on steeple slants
behind the clouds on axis bound.
cocoon the storm, these winded cants,
this spell from depths of godless sound.

let dirge be purged through broken bell,
through hollow dell with surging wind,
unearthed remains returned from hell,
the bones decayed now gardens tend.

oh, name that hides in shattered ring,
that brings the rain, becomes the night
of lightless thunder, shriven sing
the drops of dark through wicked flight.

by dripping altar, prayers fled
through clasping fingers splayed in maze,
communed with spirits past and dead,
before my eyes, a sightless gaze.

the paint of statues leeched in stains,
with weeping ink of saint’s remorse,
deformed by time and bearing chains,
condemned to hear my voice grown hoarse.

profane my soul and twist it loose
with iron pincers red with sin.
let drain my blood, my veins to sluice,
replace my eyes and rise within.
