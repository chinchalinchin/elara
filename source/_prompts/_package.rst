Larksong 
========

| at least the larks remember songs
| each morning rise you're gone again.
| 
| the mourning veils of scattered throngs 
| depart your wake without amen.
| 
| the men who take your parts away
| forget to take my silent heart.
|
| they leave a lily black bouquet
| whose petals fingers tear apart.
| 
| and when i stand alone in pain,
| the stems are bare and nothing's changed. 
| 
| the birds begin their last refrain
| as though they knew and prearranged.
| 
| if nothing else, their voice belongs;
| at least the larks remember songs.

Crystal and Glass
=================

| i glue my heart of broken glass.
| refracted rays of you contract
| along the fractures breaks amass. 
|
| we fell in love upon the grass,
| a perfect shattered artifact.
| i glue my heart of broken glass.
|
| the lake was waving evening brass
| reflected in your eyes exact
| along the fractures breaks amass.
| 
| we shared the scent of sassafras
| as water braced for sun's impact.
| i glue my heart of broken glass.
|
| the summer lapped its final pass
| and left the surface still and cracked
| along the fractures breaks amass.
|
| in dreams, these grounds i will trespass
| to find their core, and shards extract.
| i glue my heart of broken glass
| along the fractures breaks amass. 

Ode to the Heron
================

| Grey Heron, sing the song the winds will bring.
| Who lingers longer than the Winter king?  
|
| When hunting ground returns
|       through fronts of blue to ice,
| the moles in burrowed urns
|       prepare beside the mice.
| The grunting geese will veer
|       where churning warmth once drove.
| The deer all disappear
|       through dreary dreaming cove.
|
| All yield, retreat and leave their claims till Spring.
| Through fields, what muffled name on streams will ring?
|
| The answer sweeps from east--
|       Oh! Heron! Hunter Grey! 
| Cry! Rouse the sleeping beast
|       and reaping, feast on prey!
| Creep low on drift of snow
|       with coiled neck of spear;
| Let steam of gasping slow
|       their rasping scream of fear.
|
| The weather warms, yet Winter lifts your wing.
| The feathers swarm, but lone to cold you cling.
|
| In flocking song most birds
|       find mate to take to nest;
| Let chorus part the herds
|       with fire from thumping chest,
| your pumping flame that spurns
|       the burning cold on flank.
| Your silent stare discerns
|       The creatures left on bank.
|
| Each season makes of life a shape to wring.
| Each reason born in strife escapes to sing. 
|
| The Spring first strings the thread
|       of lazy chirping thrush,
| The Summer, berry red
|       and cracking eggs in brush,
| Then Autumn crows of black
|       in pecking pumpkin hay.
| Only a lonely lack
|       breeds mighty Heron Grey.
|
| When night descends, take stock of everything.
| What hidden home should find you nuzzling?
|
| What branches bear your weight?
|       Whose feathers stroke your beak?
| No human eyes await
|       the colony's mystique. 
| The shrieking calls coalesce
|       atop the forest heights,
| In alien address
|       the flame inside ignites.

Holly Tree
==========

| Under the holly tree
| bough of berries,
| its siren red
| temptation.
|
| Where life began
| on skinny knees
| retching out 
| my guts.
|
| Waxy saw-tooth skin, 
| prickly leaves, 
| the sickly buds 
| of poison seeds.
|
| The tangy tongue
| of Christmas
| funerary rites.
| 
| I spewed
| through chrysalis,
| entrails slick 
| with acid grease,
| thickly dripping
| afterbirth.
|
| Gazed upon by 
| ageless tree,
| received in holy 
| communion, my first 
| memory:
| 
| The pluming rack
| of tight blue
| veins
| that hung about
| my neck.
|
| The womb of black
| that forked
| the branching
| Earth.
|
| The world that hid
| in bitter leaves
| and pushed me
| into it. 
|
| I made a wreath 
| of holly limbs
| to prick my head
| with thoughts. 
|
| I keep its berries
| bright as death
| and touch the skin
| that baptized
| me.
