``Dance, and | Pro-ven- | çal song, | and sun- | burnt mirth!``

.. note::

    This line presents several difficulties in metering. In particular "Provençal" and "sunburnt mirth" are ambiguous when it comes to stresses. It really depends on how the poem is read. Alternative readings of this line might result in :math:`ⲠⲠⲡⲡⲠⲠⲡⲡⲠⲠ` or :math:`ⲠⲡⲡⲠⲠⲠⲡⲠⲠⲠ`. Since the poem is predominantly iambic, the closet iambic interpretation has been adopted.

| I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead;
| I lift my lids and all is born again.
| (I think I made you up inside my head.)
|
| The stars go waltzing out in blue and red,
| And arbitrary blackness gallops in:
| I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.
| 
| I dreamed that you bewitched me into bed
| And sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane.
| (I think I made you up inside my head.)
| 
| God topples from the sky, hell's fires fade:
| Exit seraphim and Satan's men:
| I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.
| 
| I fancied you'd return the way you said,
| But I grow old and I forget your name.
| (I think I made you up inside my head.)
| 
| I should have loved a thunderbird instead;
| At least when spring comes they roar back again.
| I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.
| (I think I made you up inside my head.)
