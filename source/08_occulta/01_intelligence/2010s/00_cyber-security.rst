    Hacker discrimination? Is this DEF CON or a Tea Party gathering?

    OK, so instead of showing up identified as who they are, they'll show up incognito as random individuals.

    An exercise in futility

    With the exception of speakers, Feds tend to show up at Defcon incognito. That's the fun of Spot the Fed: https://www.defcon.org/htmUdefcon-13/dc13-spotthefed.html

    This announcement is a political statement and a clever PR tactic, not an exercise in futility. You can buy Defcon tickets with cash at the door, as the organizers well know, but this lets the Feds know they're not invited this year. Of course they can still sneak in, and I imagine Spot the Fed will have some extra-good prizes.

    Pablos Holman will not arrive Vegas until Sat. afternoon...he is saying if we have anyone in town earlier than that, maybe they can swing by the Rio and pick up as many badges as are needed for you. Badges should be on sale Thursday and Friday, the line might be pretty long. DEF CON, being a hacker conference, it is cash only at the door. Badges are $180.

    Pablos says he would volunteer to do it, but he has a meeting in San Francisco so he won't have time!
