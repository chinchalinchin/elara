The Mesmeria Tapes #1 

[]: --recording. The date is June 30th, 2040--

[]: 5800. 

[]: Excuse me?

[]: The actual year is 5800. That's how many years have passed since the creation of the world. 

[]: That's not true, Mesmeria.

[]: Yes, it is.

[]: No, it's not. The world is billions of years old.

[]: Relative to who? 

[]: Excuse me?

[]: Time is a frame of reference. Who was keeping track? 

[]: That's not how it works. We can measure the amount of carbon isotropes in rocks--

[]: What do a bunch of rocks have to do with the age of the world?

[]: It tells us how old the planet is.

[]: Relative to who? A rock? Who cares!

[]: We're getting off track here. We're here to discuss REDACTED. 

[]: Why do you want to talk about *him*?

[]: Because you are the only living person who can identify him. We need your help to find him.

[]: *laughter*

[]: What's so funny, Mesmeria?

[]: How can you find someone that's real?

[]: REDACTED is very real, Mesmeria. You know that.

[]: *laughter* I don't know anything about REDACTED. You'll want to talk to Margaret for that.

[]: Who is Margaret?

[]: A real bitch, that's who. *laughter*

[]: You said you would be cooperative. 

[]: No, that doesn't sound like me. 

[]: Are you backing out of the deal?





[]: If you don't know how old the world is, you'll never understand REDACTED.
