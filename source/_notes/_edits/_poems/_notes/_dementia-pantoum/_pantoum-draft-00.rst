.. MODE: BRAINSTORM
.. This is the first draft of an unfinished pantoum. Instead of strict repetition of lines the traditional pantoum requires, in this variant the words in the line break down into syllables and regroup when the line repeats in the pantoum. I'm trying to make it about dementia and the fracturing of the mind. It's a hard task I've set myself. See if you can find any clever wordplay that could fit, or slightly better phrasing for the existing puns/wordplay. The "..." indicates the line needs filled out. Do not feel obligated to fill out the lines. I am mostly just looking for inspiration.
