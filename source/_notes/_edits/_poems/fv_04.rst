V: Parallel Universes
---------------------

| Every life is a parallel universe.
| Walking down the sidewalk lets me peer through portals
| into other dimensions, where I might be a computer scientist
| or a skinny woman wrapped in a fur coat
| or a successful hedge fund manager.
| More to the point, somewhere I am a poisonous tree frog.
| Somewhere, I am the vibrating air,
| the seductive undulations of music.
| Somewhere else I am the dirt.
| Regardless of form, everywhere I am.
