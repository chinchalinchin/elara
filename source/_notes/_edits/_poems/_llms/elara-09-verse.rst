Stone Whisper

Green silence, thick with years,
a city swallowed whole,
by roots and vines, and whispered fears.

Crumbled walls, choked by green,
a history unseen,
until...

My hand, tracing a line,
of weathered stone,
a sudden, sharp incline.

Not random, no.
Intentional.
Carved.

Letters, forming words,
a poem, a triolet,
singing like forgotten birds.

Language holds the dream's design...

The words, so clear, so bright,
a spark across the night
of ages.

The shifting self, we can't define...

A chill, despite the humid air,
a sense of presence, there,
in the stone.

Through chaos, order, we entwine...

Who were you, who sought this core?
Who carved these lines, to last and soar
above the ruin?

What truth did you pursue?
What dream did you imbue
with language, so precise, yet new?

The jungle holds its breath,
awaiting my reply,
but I have none, only the echo of death,
and life,
inscribed upon this stone, beneath a silent sky.
