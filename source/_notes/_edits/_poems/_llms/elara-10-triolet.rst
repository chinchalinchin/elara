Echo in Stone (For My Father)

The jungle breathes, a constant green,
but your breath is stilled,
your searching eyes, unseen.

You sought the lost, the overgrown,
the whispers in the stone,
a language not your own.

Language holds the dream's design,
you wrote, that day, in lines so fine,
a truth you chased, a core to find.

Thirty years have passed, the stone remains,
and I, your daughter, feel the pains,
of loss, of love, that memory sustains.

You chased the shifting self, you could not hold.
A story whispered, never to grow old,
in cities built of dust and gold.

Language holds the dream's design,
I read, and now the words are mine,
a legacy, a love, a sign.

You found your peace within the maze.
I will now find my own ways,
to honor those ends, and all your days.
