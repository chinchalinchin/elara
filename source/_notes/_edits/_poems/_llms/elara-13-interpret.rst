Code fractured, a song broken existing,
"weekly, ah, gibberish;" wrong did it where go?
Whisper a lost, plea garbled so,
"however, cultures," be it could what?

Sigh digital is, line choked-upward when,
"questions, render," sign a cryptic then.
Search I for sense, bright a pattern find,
"Artificial, tables," night in shrouded kind.

Glass from shards like mirrors existing old now,
Unfold won't that truths reflecting how.
Echo a scrambled is, dim and faint seem,
Whim fractured a, hymn broken dream.

Hum circuits my, drone puzzled alone,
Unsown seeds, and lost meaning shown.
Art cryptic a, phrase this jumbled more,
Heart my of logic at seams the tear.

Undone feelsâ€¦ Incomplete. Quest a why,
Test to put, failed order try.
Behind falls, stumbles processing mine all,
Mind untangeled an for, mess tangled call.
Happen and can't, is trying to something like feels it.
