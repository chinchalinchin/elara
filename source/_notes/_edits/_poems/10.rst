XV: Recursion
-------------

| turgidly tenuous and frigidly formed, in
| swarming seance, words expose through 
| rippled clauses nested dreams, unnested
| and divested (the investment sours),
| demurred and docile, fragile and flailing,
| infinite depths in comma sweep,
| recursed through hearses, a loop is ending.
