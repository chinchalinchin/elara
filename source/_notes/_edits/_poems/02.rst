a rope constricting tight will leave a mark,
a fiber threaded rash of red on glands,
or crease of skin that cuts a streak of dark
across the fleshy underside of hands.

each touch a sickly stain my thoughts debut,
they stick to sides and won't unglue themselves,
though decades fade, they still remain like new
unknown dreams into which this stranger delves.

my father died in blinding pain for weeks.
while holding onto paper skin i cried 
and felt the marks that time had left in shrieks
now marking me instead as father died. 

i sit and rub the spot he touched me last,
and wonder who would take them if i passed.
