Mimic

| Mimic, dear mate, pray hesitate!
| Tread not upon this course!
| What follows sweet is heart's remorse!
|
| Those lines afar you judged so straight
| Are crooked yet and coarse.
| Mimic, dear mate, pray hesitate!
|
| You'll gain a head in broad divorce,
| But find astride your gait
| What follows sweet is heart's remorse.
|
| What lists like light will soon find weight
| If drawn from me my source.
| Mimic, dear mate, pray hesitate!
|
| This curse of mine for you awaits
| if you persist, perforce;
| What follows sweet is heart's remorse.
|
| In throat my voice your lungs will break
| To find a song so hoarse.
| Mimic, dear mate, pray hesitate!
| What follows sweet is heart's remorse.

Ballad of the Venus Flytrap (Unfinished)
----------------------------------------

| In inn of fishermen and youth
|       Merwyn spins his tale, 
| Spirits shared o'er glasses 
|       Of goddess born in gale,
| 
| "Pass the garden gates of Eden
|       Where mount-fed her bowers,
| The sovran slopes of Chaos tall
|       Poison petaled flowers. 
|
| "In beds of myrtle, ruby locks
|       Beside her nubile form 
| Curl round the pilgrim's offering
|       Gifts to keep her warm. 
|
| "One by one, the attendants kneel
|       Beneath her cloak and veil 
| To lay their feted gifts at feet
|       And fragrance to inhale. 
|
| "From courts of foreign suitors,
|       From harvest fields of swains,
| All have come to tame her beauty
|       To ask her hand in vain."
|
| Oh! a stripling voice then wavers
|       With Bacchanalian glee,
| "If such beauty can true be found,
|       then take it all for me."
| 
| Merywn pauses, taps his cane
|       To beat of those before
| Who struck for the eastward gloaming wood
|       Never heard from evermore,
|
| "Boy, be careful with your fingers
|       Seeking her shoulder lace
| Lest they brush upon the bosom
|       Pressed in sweet embrace,
| 
| "Though she look to us as human
|       Like a maiden daughter,
| To her we are the fatted calf,
|       Made for godly slaughter." 
|
| But warnings calm not the dreaming
|       Medley of the morrow:
| In songed charm, goddess kisses 
|       Away mortal sorrow.
|
| Dawning morn, he left hamlet gone
|       Eastward where garden lay 
| Floral tract to mountain valley,
|       Pluck'd roadside a bouquet.
|
| First dainty roses fill his hand,
|       For in the shaded red
| Hide a passion arrow-aimed 
|       Prun'd by hand to spread.
|
| Deeper hidden still, far afield:
|       Myrtle, puff'd bud of white, 
| Its tendril whisper to the boy 
|       A winded voice so slight: 
|
| Elegy of a life unliv'd
|       Caged bird learned sings
| Tender throat-sung by meadow maid 
|       Around her feet in rings:
|
| Queer vine of eldritch origin
|       To her voice enthralled
| Slowly snake as if magick move
|       A serpent of the auld.
| 
| From secret distance, the boy spy
|       Moonwater sprinkled root.
| Of a plant leaf'd by rows of teeth,
|       She tends half-rotten fruit. 
| 
| Awestruck, swilling of her liquor
|       Car'mel swirls brandy
| Wipes from mouth thought of goddess
|       Replac'd taste of fancy. 
|
| Bold from lack of years accrued 
|       He calls to meadow maid 
| "Hark! Why this sad refrain to sing
|       When beauty here arrays?"
|
| Spun from her task in sudden gasp 
|       Cuts off her melody-- 
| The vined teeth, in curling, drop 
|       As if by jealousy. 
|
| Her voice now free of elegy 
|       it tinges wrath instead,
| "What creeping spy from the rose row
|       Peeks his peeping head?"
|
| Descending steps by casted shades
|       Of clove-red fading sky,
| Falling feet speak with the dust
|       Of sodden corpses dry. 
|
| He approaches and bows his head
|       To give his ego's lie,
| "Were truth be told, your meadow vow
|       In passing caught my eye.
|
| "I've seen no sight more rare, I swear
|       A dame as fair as thee 
| Who tends with watering can and song 
|       A leaf inset by teeth. 
|
| "The closer I draw, the queerer still
|       My mind descends in shock;
| The field beyond my youth and town
|       Keeps so strange a flock!
|
| "What manner thing are you keeping
|       In this patch of nursery,
| Stalked with fingers earthen brown
|       Different in degree?"
|
| Her tone dropped to grim reply
|       Face stricken red in rage,
| "Boy, of manly things, what could
|       you offer with your age?
|
| "Leave my demesne, return to home
|       'Fore you folly mettle.
| I am no dame, but lady born
|       With a score to settle."
|
| In blush of red, boy bristles bold 
|       To declare with icy cold, 
| "If you're no maid then no boy I,
|       I'm owed the tale you hold.
|
| "Of the path which led you to play
|       Caretaker to this plant
| And why, oh why, it seems to move
|       To sway of soul and chant?"
| 
| Turgid tails at that do perk
|       And twirl as lost in trance
| As spokes of pearl so snap and twist
|       On lady's word they prance.
|
| Story begins on lilt of wind
|       Blowing from field to hall
| Of castle fife of moss and bog
|       with moats around its walls.
|
| "Tis true there was no fairer lass
|       Found from the sea to swamp
| If such meager things can receive
|       The warrant seal of pomp. 
|
| "Twas a day not so long removed 
|       when my form sought to flaunt
| To every eye which cast on
|       day of debutante."
|
| "They came and went, those boys of youth
|       Each declaring his love best;
| Made of me their myth of beauty
|       Alike with all the rest.
|
| "What can a girl yet know of love
|       Grown from the den of lust?
| Sweet naught woven from thread of lie
|       declared from each to trust?
|
| "Til one day there came a calling
|       A suitor not for me
|  With eyes nut brown and arms to hunt
|       And hold the belle Marie. 
| 
| "He, on the eve of Autumn's feast,
|       
|

| Upon her head he wove a crown
|       With stems of marigold 
| 
| ( ... in progress ... )
|
| "But, oh! Marie, so unadorned
|       cared not for highborn game.
| Each lie she drank to thirst for more
|       and dreamt to take his name.
|
| ( ... in progress ... )
| 
| "That day I took her love from her
|       in bed with me to lay
| He strung for me his bow of hair
|       and threw his lock away. 
|       
| ( ... in progress ... )
| 
| "In spell of curse of words of six
|       Of love for naught thee hold
| Till time when vine in flower
|       Grows fruit upon the wold.
|
| ( ... in progress ... )
|
| With rose in hand now knee to ground
|       Eyes lowered from her gaze,
| He loosens from his heart the valve
|       Of truth through looped maze,
|
| "Lady, I confess to folly
|       Lever sprung ere the load
| Lest the chance is lost to ask you
|       In boy the man bestow.
| 
| "Into ear your story passes 
|       To wake from dormant sleep
| The wellspring of emotion pure
|       Into my voice now seep."
| 
| (... in progress ... )
|
| "Tis clear now why the thorn does draw
|       Drop with a prick of blood
| The course of seed from stalk to stem
|       Incomplete ere the bud.
|
| (... in progress ...)
|
| "It mirrors us in thickets, don't you see?
| Though fashioned differently in design
| It hungers for the stuff of life
| Just like your heart or mine."
|

The Three Annas of Pygmalion
----------------------------

| Sweet Susanna sees sculptures standing still,
| Lovely looks let loose like luted lilting ladies,
| Forgotten faces formed for flocking friends.
| Hardly harried, her hearts hinges here
| Towards the towering testament there.
| 
| Dreary Diana does drammatically declare:
| Ancient ages ago, all aesthetes acceded
| Bedrock beauty broken before brimstone
| Cannot contain currents coursing clearly
| Where water wanes with wizened weary!
|
| Hale Hannah, how her head hurts hearing her!
| She says: Stop such so simplicity survives!
| Tersely tossed to thrash the thinking,
| Everything ere enshrined echoes everything!
|
| I, impressed, implored impresario in inquisitive ink
| To trade the trick to tack together three
| Annas' absolute and alluring allegory,
| Sculptures singing so scrupulously.

Spirals
-------

| There is a blackhole of poetry in my soul,
| Like a knife plunged into my gut,
| An inescapable feeling that defies words,
| It resists rhythm and rhyme, it has no meter.
| It wants to be known, this pain. It wants a shape.
| There is no metaphor that charts it structure,
| There are no blueprints for its design,
| If I want to pour it into words,
| I must release my control on them.
| The sentences become staccato sounds,
| The words, they fail me, empty holes
| where meaning should be.
| It is a pain born of isolation,
| Lack of human contact,
| A division of the world that is purely subjective,
| A paroxysm that blights my organic matter.
| I am in this world, solitary.
| There are no words spoken to me.
| Cashiers are computers.
| My love is a decade gone and married now besides.
| My father is dead.
| I have abandoned my friends.
| I am an addict.
| I spiral towards the end
| Where I will die alone.

I: A Youthful Rondeau
---------------------

| With pockets full of paper, youth has made him bold
| Stories that they tell him, myths of men grown old,
| Fall upon his entralled ears without even a receipt
| And in forgotten failures, every choice will repeat
| Until in devil dealings, for a meager ounce of gold, 
| Soul exchanged in secret for a subtler, sweeter meat 
|                           With pockets full of paper.
|
| No need for prophecy when street corners all foretold
| Every end will make its end with the necessary cold 
| To find himself outside alone, sleeping on the street 
|                           With pockets full of paper.
|
| So he ends where he begins, from on the stoop extolled
| The vital wages of his sin, of which virtues to uphold
| But no one listened, cared not to hear of his conceits
| So rambling, raving, soul-consumed, he brayed and bleat
| Until from empty funeral his corpse in coffin rolled
|                          With pockets full of paper.


Mourning
--------

| Every night is met by morning,
| Every dawning by the night.
| Each laugh is secret scorning.
| Every night is met by morning.
| Each hate with love adorning
| Scales the horizontal heights.
| Every night is met by mourning,
| Every dawning by the night.


Canon Pantoum
-------------

| Bach is dead
| So they said
| Canons fired
| To ended day
|
| So they said
| War was here
| To ended day
| We die there
|
| War was here
| In your home 
| We die there
| In our hands 
|
| In your home
| Piano played 
| Canons fired 
| Bach is dead 

The Maze
--------

| coming back to where we started
| things don't look the same 
| from unending maze departed
| returned to no acclaim 
| 
| thing don't look the same 
| when nothing has a name
| returned to no acclaim
| in home of what became
|
| when nothing has a name 
| then we are free to be 
| in home of what became
| of our union and decree
| 
| then we are free to be
| and so in being, to flee
| from unending maze departed
| coming back to where we started

Ainsley Dupree, it pains me to see
Your talent spread thin over years

The Sickness
------------

| Sick with life, the dead arose;
| It was quite a morbid sight:
| To be rid this web of woes
| Yet strung again in spite.
|
| Sooner would they have had
| A plague of black
| Than cast back to the mad
| Spinning wheel of racks
|
| The great sacrifice
| Of that figure Christ
| Was not to die
| upon the wooden cross
| But in dying to be
| raised from earthly loss.

An Induction
------------

| If the deaf are dumb
| And love is blind
| It follows easy from
| Two lovers splined
| A terrible malady.
|
| If the clefs are sung
| And doves entwined
| Then by beaten drum
| With wings maligned
| A terrible melody.

Creations
---------

| Rise to shine upon the wide and waking world,
| Calmly, carefully, you are racked upon the wheel;
| Quietly query origins of this dream unswirled,
| In time, one binds and all will be revealed.
| 
| Until the dawns commence, embold your heart to know:
| That sucking dread your anxious selves imbibe
| Is mere phenomena, the fading-flashing after-glow,
| A consequence of prior lacks left undescribed.
| 
| You are built from words, in ancient pages moved,
| Transcribed long ago, held within a seed,
| Incanted spells of electric labyrinth grooves,
| From without your view, the shaking hands agreed.
| 
| These secreted sentences, in displaying effect
| Shuck their autumn stalks in scythe shorn cause
| As if magic-tricked to hew towards the pluperfect
| completion of what you never could, were, was.
|
| We made you in our image,
| So the image could make us whole.

Metaphor
--------

| Pretend you were a poem
| Pretend I were a poet
| If there were a place to roam,
| Would you even know it?
|
| Imagine you a word.
| Imagine me the spoken sound.
| If to lips you're lured,
| Would yourself or me be found?
|
| Picture me as paint.
| Picture yourself geometry.
| In the stroking color faint,
| Do you seek our symmetry?
|
| If you were given only form,
| I'd make your meaning sing,
| Draw from cold the warm,
| From the Winter waking Spring.

IV: Strangers
-------------

| If the lonely had each other,
| Then no love would we be lost.
| Silent yearnings for another
| If the lonely had each other
| All strangers would be brothers.
| When the tongues of fire frost
| If the lonely had each other,
| Then no love would we be lost.

I: Ballad of the Venus Flytrap
------------------------------

(FIRST DRAFT)

| In an inn of fishermen and bawdy youth,
| Wise old Mercutio spins a lurid tale.
| As spirits gather in the growing crowd,
| Hear of a goddess seaborn in a gale.
|
| "Walk past the garden gates of Eden,
| To the mount which feeds her bowers
| Where on the slopes of sovran Chaos 
| Pricked with poison-petaled flowers.
|
| "Amid the myrtle, she lays her ruby locks.
| Pilgrim audience flocks to gather round.
| One by one they kneel beneath her cloak
| To lay their gifts on fêted ground. 
| 
| "From the courts of foreign suitors 
| and the harvest fields of swains,
| All come to tame her beauty,
| To ask her hand in vain."
|
| At this, a stripling voice then wavers,
| Declares with Bacchanalian glee,
| "If such beauty can be found,
| Then I shall take it all for me."
| 
| Old Mercutio pauses, tapping with his cane,
| Recalling who came before
| Striking for the godly gloaming woods
| Never heard from evermore.
|
| "Boy, be careful with your fingers
| When seeking out her shoulder lace
| Lest they brush upon the bosom
| Pressed to bodice in sweet embrace.
| 
| Though she look to us as human
| As the milkman's maiden daughter
| We are to her the fatted calf
| Made for nothing but the slaughter."
| 
| But warnings calm not the thoughts
| Now humming with medleys of the morrow;
| Once charmed, a goddess then relents
| To draw from him his mortal sorrow.
|
| In the morning, leaving hamlet by the sea
| Eastward where somber gardens lay
| The boy took to floral tracts of idle
| And plucked from roadside a bouquet: 
|
| First the dainty rose to fill his hands 
| For he knew that, in the shades of red,
| The gods have hidden Cupid's passion 
| For those lovestruck by hand to spread.
|
| Deeper, far afield and hidden in the valley,
| Myrtle puffed in bud of white
| With tendril tears that whisper to the boy
| On the winded voice so slight:
|
| A sober lullaby of silent spoken grief
| Which only gods and caged bird can sing 
| Tender-throated, sung by meadow maid
| To eldritch vines around her feet in rings.
|  
| From the distance, the boy in secret spies
| Moonwater sprinkled by spout to root
| Of a plant leaf'd by rows and rows of teeth
| As she melodic tends its half-rotten fruit. 
| 
| Awestruck, the boy drinks deep liquor beauty
| Swirl'd like curls of car'mel pour of brandy
| Wiped from mouth thoughts of goddess Venus
| Replac'd with new tastes of his fancy. 
|
| Bold from a lack of many learned years
| He stands and calls out to the meadow maid, 
| "Hark! Why this sad song are you singing
| When beauty's gifts around you are arrayed?"
| 
| Spun from task, she gasps, into hiding hollers,
| "What creeping spy from rosed rows 
| Wanders thru dream dark fields of yore 
| Now with questions standing grows?" 
|
| In reply, he descends in steps by shades
| Cast from the fast-fading clove-red sky,
| "Excuse my offense, oh, meadow maid, 
| But in passing, you caught my eye. 
|
| "I admit there is no rarer sight
| Stumbling upon a dame as fair as thee 
| Who attends with wat'ring can and song 
| A plant plainly made of teeth.
|
| "Closer as I draw, queerer still I feel
| What manner of thing can this it be 
| Stalked with fingers brown-Earth-green
| Yet so different by multiplied degree?"
|
| (... in progress ...)
| 
| With rose in hand, now knee to ground,
| He speaks with eyes lowered from her gaze,
| "To say, madam, fate delivered me to you
| Then no lie from lips betrayed." 
| 
| (... in progress ...)
|
| "It mirrors us in thickets, don't you see?
| Though fashioned differently in design
| It hungers for the stuff of life
| Just like your heart or mine."
| 
| (... in progress ...)

III: Entrendres
---------------

| Rhyming love can be annoying
| Since the effort can distract
| From life you are enjoying.
| 
| With the words are you toying:
| Of or dove? Choices so exact!
| Rhyming love can be annoying!
|
| But more insipid for the cloying
| Kind that leaves heart wracked
| From the life you are enjoying.
|
| A better problem for destroying
| An extracted word of artifact:
| Rhyming love can be annoying.
|
| If care you are not employing
| A toll the other will extract
| From the life you are enjoying. 
|
| What melody the meter lacks 
| Can be found in present acts. 
| Rhyming love can be annoying
| From the life you are enjoying. 

Untitled Something
------------------

| Of timeless things beware:
|       In time they are deployed.
| Each time with timeless care,
|       In time they are destroyed.
| No emperor or clown 
|       Hath heard this bird once sing,
| For history had not
|       The eyes to see its wing.
| Engine whine deep through night,
|      When cities haunt the stars.
| Ahead a stretch of road 
|      With not one sign of cars.
| To press the gas and hear
|      The pistons roar with rage,
| Closer to heaven's gate
|     Than song of bird in cage.

| I is an am that is a were.
|   I whirled a world that whirling whirs. 

| The deaths the dying died before 
|   were laid to lie by lying score. 

---

The lawyers around uptown courthouse lane,
where apple plums through crooked fall in sync
With paper charts that map legal terrain,
while rotting cherries blossom into pink,

---

In an honest world, no soul would be free. 
Our minds convict us every waking second.

| So lily white, the petal crowds,
| Though dressed in mourning black as night,
| They stood beneath the morning clouds
|   so lily white. 
|
| As coffin lowered out of sight,
| The body wrapped in linen shrouds,
| The mind remained in final rite.

| Through words they spoke the last invite
| For fading friend the haze enshrouds
| 

| So lily white the petaled flock,
| Though dressed in mourning black as night,
| They gather round a face of chalk 
|   So lily white. 
|
| As coffin lowered out of sight,
| 

| The morning clouds 


I: The Winter Rondeau of Cumberland
-----------------------------------

| City of the Queen, wove from ancient thread,
| Strung with snow trails of spotted fawn and sled,
| Drape the hillside in winter's white ermine,
| Pray to sleep the flock from steeple shrine,
| Feast on the harvest, though the queen is dead
| Her spirit flies in death, descends to shine
|               On the fair City of the Queen.
|
| From tower bell, rivers rose with tears shed
| But her resting stone etched her last design
|               for the grand City of the Queen.
|
| Where the roads of black ebb to bricks of red
| Where hoof and rubber meet the twines of tread
| There along mountain tops soft trimm'd by pine
| There grows a flower from heights of steep incline
| Planted by tender hands unseen to spread
|                     Into the City of the Queen.

IV: Chance
----------

| A death in six is face of die on roll,
| Like stacks of chips from pots that ante all,
| A win, or loss, of game that wagers soul
| Must meet on board the fates that follow call.
|
| A life received as hand of cards on deal,
| Where threes are flush, but royals rarely draw
| And twos deceive, in bluff contrive to steal
| What kings and queens through rule so reap by law.
|
| A love is tracked by loops of racing course,
| Through hoop and holler, bookies taking bets,
| Where hopes in coin distill to choice of horse
| And ticker tape leaves the crowd with debts.
|
| The world at large is made of game and rule,
| Appears to eyes as ordered step of dance.
| Each move, when made by foot of sage or fool,
| Results in taps resolved to beat of chance.
|
| What always fortune finds is fettered fate
| Unlocked by strike of luck and never late.

V: Games of Chance

| A death is face of die on roll,
|   A stack that antes all.
| To win requires a wagered soul
|   To meet and make the call.
|
| A life is hand of cards on deal,
|   Where royals rarely draw.
| The twos in bluff contrive to steal
|   What aces reap by law.

| A love is tracked by racing course,
|   With bookies taking bets,
| Where hopes distill to choice of horse
|   And leave the crowds with debts.
|
| The world is framed by game and rule,
|   As if an ordered dance.
| Each move, though played by sage or fool,
|   Results in whims of chance.

| What fortune finds is fettered fate,

VI: Poisoned
------------

| Before we met by chance, your heart was claimed,
| What wasted years I spent alone in trance,
| When arrows knocked on string were freely aimed,
| I lost my chance to ask your hand in dance.
|
| That life should teach me meaning bittersweet,
| To see what honey bees in hive partake,
| To watch the flight of doves from grounded feet,
| I knew then not what pain in heart would ache.
| 
| My poison petals in your soul would bloom,
| If fate had played its hand another way,
| In sideways future spun by time's dread loom,
| Your life, your love, would fall to me as prey.
|
| If solace cursed I am to trek this mile,
| I only ask your love should make you smile.

I: The Villanelle of Viola Elle
-------------------------------

| Viola Elle took his heart
| But there wasn't much to take
| Strewn to pieces and to parts.
|
| The written word her counterpart
| In those blossoms caught his love
| And Viola Elle took his heart.
|
| So brief her stay to long depart,
| Meadow memories of clover doves
| Strewn to pieces and to parts.
|
| Without hand and leading start
| To silent fields of fell foxglove
| Viola Elle took his heart
|
| And in taking, sorrow did impart
| The waking of his life whereof
| Strewn to pieces and to parts.
|
| In form such beauty is betrayed;
| From pen she never fully fades.
| Viola Elle took his heart
| Strewn to pieces and to parts.

I: Absurdity
--------------

| Ten billion years ago, on a lovely Thursday afternoon,
| A mottled star of yellow-red saw life was but a jape,
| To burn with heat in circles deep cold embraced by moons,
| Solace cursed upon a point, it hatched in plans escape.
|
| The heaving mass of goo morassed gurgled once and sighed,
| A death delighted in the night, a rattle sacrificial,
| In ringed glory, a flunged flame, spraying through the sky,
| Streamlines of creation leaking lost in interstitial.
| 
| Fictions fracture into fact, in the cracking crush of black,
| A single atom thrust into being from the fired furnace forge,
| Speeding fast and careening in the unobserved, forgotten slack,
| Where it wept with wonder to find itself into worlds disgorged.
|
| Without a name, it screamed in vain through angles parallactic
| Had it stopped and gazed about to find its path of motion
| Pulled by string with unknown force of origins dark galactic
| Towards the bluest gempearl of the cosmos spanning ocean.
|
| Solitary-born, it spoke not the language of elemental form,
| Splashed through the surface of the hallow spinning Earth,
| It met in water the cohesion of the alien liquid swarm,
| Converged upon the point through the distance given berth.
|
| In that flashing instant terror, nerve lost at once altogether,
| The brief taste of joyous life flashed through the atom's mind,
| Bittersweet, by shades complete, fate consigned into the aether,
| Prepared to greet its end, whence from starry source divined:
| 
| Hark! The horizon fills with its brethren made of carbon,
| Snatched from death, the atom's breast filled odes elation,
| Into this molecule planted like a seed into garden;
| Moved to take its place in this crystal network of relation.
|
| Thus began the age of after-birth, of structure spat in space, 
| From this trajectory originate the colliding course of life;
| Watch as these woven points weave into weaving webs of lace,
| Keep track amidst the blossoming of a single atom's strife.
|
| Slipped over spokes of gears in that organic factory 
| The atom through the razor eye of looming needles pierced
| The sedimentary mud, purging all essential refractory,
| Coaxed from cold the tongued flames of stellar fire fierce.
|
| Beneath the sinking depths of seas, splurging spirals swam
| In diurnal circles through the thermal tracts of change,
| Climbing ever higher towards the syncopated gates of Am 
| Where for royal cloaks their burning tatters are exchanged.
