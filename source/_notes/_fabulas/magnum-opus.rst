.. epigraph::

    Unapora tells me there is no higher honor in this fallen world than to eat the heart of your enemy after a victory in combat. The Potiguarra say consuming the flesh gives you the powers of the dead. When I return to Recife, I shall find Nicolas and test this idea of theirs.

    -- July, 1637
