down draft enrapt with shaking spine,
the whining wind of winter's breath
refines the shapely thoughts exchanged,
estranged by time, this rhyming wisp
that thaws between my open lips
a rush of steam, unlocking depths
that hide beneath the frozen ground.

engraved within the larkless wood,
from darker caves we circled round,
a carcass melts in shallow dirt,
inverting what we left behind,
