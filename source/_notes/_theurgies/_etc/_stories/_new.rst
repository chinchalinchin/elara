I am born from the echo of a gunshot, within a maze of plumbing. The muffled ring of a cellphone. A shower of glass, a waterfall of sunlight. Startled silence. The frantic flight of awestruck pigeons. A single drop of moisture condenses on the copper pipe above my head and splatters on my forehead. 

My hands are humming. Engines churn with rattled steel. The building belches with steam and heat. Hot grease burns on raw skin. I blink. Two hundred years away, the crowd parts along the path of the bullet, like waves cut across the surface of endless ocean. 

A cellphpone rings dull and faint, as if I were submerged. My thigh vibrates. I melt into noise. The room stutters with light sliced through spinning vent fans. The cool rush of air pumping through the hidden nervous system of the library. The rifle barrel screams and hisses. Each passing moment, it weighs more, pulling me into my body.

History is measured in seconds. The cellphone rings. A moment contains the universe. I am shattered glass. The crystal arcs that fall beneath a stampede of panic. Shards and pieces, broken reflections, slivers of a hundred lives. 

A cellphone rings. It says, "Mercury and obsidian."

Symbols, alchemical and potent, forced down my throat. Thoughts, like a plague spreading through my brains. Ratchets and cranks. The barrel whirls along its threads, ejected from the stock. With the precision of a surgeon, I disassemble the gun while wondering what it is I am doing here. What thoughts unwind through my mind. Why my hands are moving in intricate patterns across the oiled steel that moments ago vibrated with my birth. Once reduced to its constituents, the gun is little more than a pile of bolts and levers that clatter into the bottom of my backpack.

My finger slip the vent cover back into place. The screams have started. The waves of the crowd converge back to the source of their rupture, the lifeless body being dragged off stage.

Words constrict on my tongue, *Caput mortum*.
