    The Invocation of Metric Code
    =============================

    A Pythonic poem in (mostly) metric form.

    .. tip::

        it matters not the form of thought,
        in verse or code, a mix of both,
        these words command with meaning fraught
        the rush of green through stalks of growth
        in ground of earth or problem sought,
        with meter found in solemn oath.

Ballads

Absurdity
---------

| One lovely Thursday afternoon
|   Two billion years ago,
| A star embraced by arcs of moons
|   Conceived despair and woe. 
| 
| A sordid joke of yellow-red,
|    Ribald and mocking jape:
| To burn with heat in circles dead
|    with no hope of escape
|
| So solace cursed upon a point,
|    it drew a mighty plan
| As spinning round its lock and joint
|    its ending now began.
| 
| The heaving mass of goo morassed
|    then gurgled once and sighed;
| A rattle scream of flames harassed
|    what silent void denied. 
| 
| The sacrificial rings were flung
|   in sprays across the sky;
| The interstitial ropes then wrung
|   as threads it bound untie. 
|
| And in these fictions fracture facts:
|    A single atom forged
| And bellow blown through heaven's tracts
|    to find itself disgorged. 
| 
| The crush of black, once unobserved,
|    in fire found its sight.
| The atom woke from dreams unnerved
|    in sailing stream of flight. 
| 
| Without a frame, it screamed in vain
|    Through paralactic curves
| That weave the sieves with cluttered skein
|    Of dark galactic nerves. 
|
| Commotion drowned, it gazed about
|    along the ends it aimed:
| The bluest gem beyond a doubt
|    the cosmos ever named. 
| 
| It wept to see a brilliant Earth,
|    the fate bestowed by chance,
| And in its cackles rose a mirth
|    expressed in photon's dance. 
|
| It splashed the surface spinning fast,
|    now lost amid the sea. 
| The water rose at what trespassed,
|    mistook it for debris.
|
| The liquid swarm convened in waves,
|    to flood the tiny core.
| They stripped and pried, as hunger craves
|    and always wants for more. 
|
| The terror flashed, as pulled apart,
|   its briefly tasted life
| now disappeared before its start 
|   beneath the wetted knife. 
|
| So bittersweet, by shades complete, 
|   resigned into the black,
| the atom met its end on feet 
|   and braced for last attack.
|
| But fortune found where will converged,
|   as snatched from death it gasped
| And saw from depths the land emerged,
|   where brethren all were clasped.
|
| A molecule of carbon made
|   from crystal network cast
| through jointed links of atom braid
|   that helix ghosts amassed. 
|
| Began the age of afterbirth, 
|   of structure spat in space,
| originating blessed on Earth,
|   atomic interface. 
|
| Now watch along the webbing sewn
|   the single atom weave
| Through warps and wefts and whetted stone,
|   the knits of stellar sleeve.

The Ballad of the Isle
----------------------


| I - Spring
| 
| I - March (Mutable Water)

| The island formed where rivers meet,
|   where silt through vortex fords.
| The place emerged a brokered feat, 
|   a land of met accords.
|
| A mantle crown, in breaching air,
|   the regents all proclaim
| a vessel poured from blooded heir
|   of season's last remain.
|
| So March the army sorties cease,
|   embarking east and west 
| to mark the chartered pact with peace,
|   obeisance paid and blessed.
| 
| Here pairs of fish in lunar sway
|    coordinate their fins
| in swooping ornament display
|    with flocking mirrored twins.
|
| Behold the treaty words in ink,
|   the scrolls in future's brine,
| the sutures binding swords in sync
|   to island's hallow shrine.
|
| II - April (Cardinal Fire)
|
| The webs of Spring such crude affairs
|   when strung with spinning songs;
| the threaded compromise ensnares
|   the spidered plotting throngs. 
|  
| The April session clauses creep
|   and wolves with sharpened claws,
| deceived by strategems of sheep,
|   retract their motioned laws.  
|
| But blurting rams befoul the ploy,
|   with filibuster bleets
| that break the still the ewes enjoy;
|   the argument repeats.
|
| To raven galleries' refrain
|    in rabble squalls of wind,
| they find in mutual disdain
|    their hopes together pinned. 
|
| Elusive votes are overcast 
|   on cloudy ballots posed.
| By noon, the forum order passed
|   conceded plans proposed.
|
| III - May (Fixed Earth)
|
| A barren hump prepared with zeal
|   as sparrows plow their seeds.
| From sprouted weed to plants' reveal
|   through curtains made of reeds. 
|
| The shoots are sunk and water sewn
|   through roots of flooded banks
| where mudded flanks of fish cyclone
|   around the studded ranks. 
| 
| A retinue arrives from sea
|   atop a snow-white bull.
| Its royalty with one decree
|   begins the reign in full.
|
| The trees then stake foundations firm,
|   cement what's broken free, 
| confirm the seed to bring to term
|   the squawking newborn plea.
|
| A birth announced to kneeling crowds
|   in congregation's girth, 
| by May pronounced through sealing clouds
|   of consecrated Earth.
|
| II - Summer
| 
| I - June (Mutable Air)
| 
| When stellar swans survey the dawn
|   of constellated shores,
| their forms in flight are downward drawn
|   towards gravitating cores. 
|
| They veer through plumes of pheromone,
|   converge at silent points.
| Diverging tracts, though yearly grown, 
|   lead back where June annoints.
|
| At last the Summer bursts with life
|   and summons forth its herds
| to open market pastures rife
|   with bounty born by birds. 
|  
| In shallows deer appear to graze
|   beside the lazing drapes
| of rays, the incandescent haze
|   that veils their swaying shapes.
|
| Then maiden buds unfold to bees 
|   their sweetly nectared heat;
| unladen, drowsy, through the breeze,
|   the teasing fumes secrete. 
|
| II - July (Cardinal Water)
|
| Along the flowing inlet streams 
|   the festival begins.
| Caressing music tinges dreams
|   with cricket violins.
|
| Soft underfoot the cancers tap,
|   enrapt by vibrant chords. 
| The snapping prance of shells enwrap
|   the island shore with hordes.
|
| As gondolas of lilies' bud
|   that carry courting toads
| through swampy bogs to ports of mud
|   relieve their tadpole loads.
|
| Oh! Jubilee, this boon, July
|   through fallow leas by moon,
| when rodents swoon in cups of rye 
|   and fall to bed too soon.
|
| Amid the revelry a kiss
|   to memory's delight,
| two larks alight in fading bliss
|   fulfill this final night. 
|
| III - August (Fixed Fire)
|
| What bittersweet perfumes release
|   in looming throes of age,
| when isle matures through orange cerise, 
|   engulfed in scents of sage.
|
| Though leonine its roar in youth,
|   the shedding source of mane
| replies with veins of blood vermouth
|   through suffocating grain.
|
| Of August lines that empire grew,
|   once cloaked in ermine garbs,
| unkempt and molting, flake sinew,
|   their branches wreathed in barbs.
|
| Though riches hide in golden limb,
|   the leaves dissolve to dust,
| consoled in wind to hushing skim
|   what wealth remains in gust. 
|
| Discreetly cloaked from time the Fall
|   of secret reign's decline
| through crimson's spectrum vine, all
|   gone brown, forgetting shine.
|
| III - Autumn
| 
| I - September (Mutable Earth)
|
| September storms suspend the skies
|   resplendent morning pinks
| above the waking window eyes
|   despairing foregone winks. 
| 
| What ears of wheat will balance scales? 
|   What maiden disappears? 
| Condensing answers dance in gales,
|   descending hemispheres.
|
| Now Autumn comes with heavy rain 
|   to test the borders drawn.
| The water drained from level plain
|   in flooding rose the dawn.
|
| The thunder heralds sundered age 
|   besieged by droplets fat 
| with blood of yearly plundered wage, 
|   enraged what Spring begat.   
| 
| What muddy lanes then sluice the drowned
|   debris and sweep from field
| the tumbling tumult, turned aground
|   and heaped by waves to wield.
|
| II - October (Cardinal Air)
|
| Divided sky once halved in poise, 
|   succumbs to blackened press,
| the hours compress to whiter noise
|   in surging strained excess.
|
| October chopping peaks depressed
|   through interlocking weeks
| deplete reserves that Summer stressed
|   to balking vassal shrieks. 
|
| Retreating columns' sullen flight,
|   deserting homes and kin, 
| the fleeing wash through rapids white
|   with waters steeped in sin.
|
| So inch by inch the tides reclaim
|   the island kingdom keep
| and cast it down without a name
|   to swirling depths of sleep.
|
| The atlas page is ripped anew,
|   schematic contour holes
| where once there rose a sprout to blue
|   now rising streams of souls. 
|
| III - November (Fixed Water)
|
| Orion's arrow point is plunged
|   through lunging fronts of hail
| across the waves where life expunged
|   remains through shadowed veil.  
|
| For down below, the stones make schemes
|   in skipping sprees like drunks,
| inlaid in sunken trees through seams
|   as ballast for their trunks.
| 
| Arise the turret towers stark
|   against the ruddered land 
| to touch the ceiling shuttered dark
|   and brace what sprawling spanned. 
|
| Beneath the surface flowers form
|   as shades of algae grow
| atop the castle walls in swarm,
|   the borough glade aglow.
|
| November's embers burn a while
|   between the exiled graves.
| Remembered nocturnes sung beguile
|   the damned, forgottten knaves. 
|
| IV - Winter
|
| I - December (Mutable Fire)
|
| A rending gale begins to blow
|   above where worlds still thrive.
| Descending sickles diving slow
|   as primal ends arrive.
|
| Let Winter lens of crystal glass
|   behold submerged the fast,
| alive with dancing ghosts en masse
|   retreading paths now past. 
|
| Its poison stings but lacks the kill,
|   the sweet paralysis
| of time stood still in languid chill
|   around the palaces. 
|
| The stasis holds in cold command 
|   the surface wraiths in play. 
| They turn to gems, encased expand
|   beyond the skinned decay. 
|
| Dissolved December center breaks, 
|   dismembered lattice links,
| upending states, revolving wakes;
|   the idle spirit shrinks. 
| 
| II - January (Cardinal Earth)
|
| The horns of plenty now cry a dirge
|   as prying cold enfolds
| the last remains from island's purge 
|   outcast from stable moulds.
|
| Through sieging vortices of shard
|    the kingdom yard is cleaved.
| Bombarding sheets of ice discard
|    in circles ruins sieved.
|
| What moments held in spells now spent
|   impels the course of freeze.
| The towers brought to knees repent,
|   now felled by Time's disease.
| 
| The afterlife morassed in cracks
|   of marrow twisted blue,
| the wighted bones of zodiacs
|   imbued with pallid hue.
|
| So seconds pass eternally,
|   this January clock.
| The island keep returns to sea
|   through grains of sand to chalk.
|
| III - February (Fixed Air)
|
| Yet February always brings 
|   the forest chorus lines,
| the chirping chickadee that sings 
|   from luted bows and vines. 
|
| From south, the scouting vees of geese,
|    with probes of swiveled neckcd 
| that follow fronts of warmth's caprice,
|    are promise-held in check.
|
| When Spring returns the tides recede,
|   but hollow urns are filled. 
| The ashes spill through snaking weed,
|   a year of life distilled. 
| 
| The overflows, Ambrosia wine,
|   Elysian cups of dust,
| from Earth unfroze the redesign
|   of missions more robust.
|
| The angel beaks of birds baptize
|   the dirt in streaking aisle.
| The cycle arcs in sharp reprise:
|   the ballad of the isle.

The Mad Muses of Sad Cracked Jack
---------------------------------

| Part I - Thalia
| 
| The question beggars even now
|   For answers we still lack.
| No one has ever said the how
|   Of what that cracked our Jack.
|
| He woke that day and heard the song
|   That framed his steps with beat, 
| The meter stick that smacked along
|   Behind his fuzzled feet. 
|
| At first he thought he dreamt the verse,
|   These words you read unfold.
| But when he thinks the thoughts recurse
|   And seep through pages' mould. 
|
| Aghast he jolts and cries aloud, 
|   "What trickster plays these tricks?"
| Then shocked to find his speech endowed
|   with stresses timed to ticks.
|
| Alas, if Jack had only known 
|   the furies fate had loosed--
| "What furies now?" His groan
|   reply to rhymes reduced. 
|
| What fatal flaw entrapped this man?
|   "I'm just an office clerk!"
| But forces orchestrate a plan
|   no human born can shirk.
|
| In boxer briefs, he stumbles out,
|   Escapes from bed to hall,
| And every inch he runs to rout
|   The rhythm's faster call. 
|
| In morning light, the very sight 
|   Of frantic Jack alerts
| The neighborhood to pending blight
|   Of curse this line asserts.
|
| "Oh, neighbors, please, receive my plea!
|   There's something very wrong!"
| He cries with gasp from bended knee,
|   "I only speak in song!"
|
| A single friend then steps on stage,
|   So named to fit the bill,
| For names are fate and fettered wage,
|   They called her lovely Jill. 
| 
| "Jack? What the hell is going on? Are you okay?"
|
| At that our Jack is taken back,
|   Her voice as clear as glass
| With not a hint of verse to track
|   Through mazes long and crass.
|
| "How can it be!? An ask so free
|   While I to scheme conform!"
| His diction sweeps anastrophe,
|   Mosaics teeming swarm.
|
| She kneels to him and whispers soft,
|   A voice as kind as cane,
| The type that beats, not sweet but loft
|   To strike the skin with pain. 
|
| "Are you on drugs or something else?"
|
| Now Jill, this dame, the missus made
|   To fill the damsel role,
| The unsuspecting victim played
|   To ballad's very goal.
|
| These words are met with wide-eyed stare
|   As Jack realized his plight;
| He hears the lines designs prepare,
|   the ending rhymes invite. 
|
| "Oh, listen, Jill, and listen well!"
|   He takes her hand in his, 
| "These words that flow are not a spell,
|   They simply are what is! 
|
| "I hear the force that cracks the shape
|   incessant stresses bind!"
| He cries as crowds surround to gape
|   at madness here enshrined. 
| 
| "I see," She nods, but doesn't see, 
|   and picks him up to walk,
| "Perhaps," She says, "It's time to flee,"
|   and hauls our Jack in shock.
| 
| By hand he's led while thoughts digress,
|   absurdity in tow. 
| And spanned by doubt the thoughts obsess
|   unheard except through flow. 
|
| As doors are slammed, the cats are scrammed
|   from cushions where they sat,
| And leaning in as Jill enjambed,
|   "We need to have a chat
|
| About the--fact--" she stops mid-sound, 
|   and measures out her tone,
| as slowly wound on axis bound,
|   her speech is ground and thrown,
|
| "About the fact you seem irate,"
|   She says while tongue contorts
| Around retorts that resonate
|   with words this verse consorts,
|
| "And not to mention halfway nude,"
|    She says with glance that proved,
| "Let's find you something more subdued,"
|    But Jack cannot be moved. 
|  
| "Why do you rhyme? You're part of it!"
|   In anger, Jack explodes. 
| "This horrid crime," His words are spit,
|   "Explain what fate unloads!"
|
| Beneath her brow, her eyes express
|   concern through gems of blue,
| "You're clearly broken by some stress,
|   Now tell it to me true!"
|
| Attacked by cackles, Jack, he laughs,
|   "Yes! Stress! The very pest!
| The force that binds these epigraphs
|   And leaves me most distressed!"
| 
| "Your speech is weird and most perturbed,"
|   Her tone now wavers weak,
| "The implication is disturbed,"
|   As rhymes begin to leak. 
|
| "Disturbed is just the word I'd pick
|   describing my disease. 
| It strickens me a lunatic 
|   and swings me by trapeze.
|
| Despair becomes the one sole choice,"
|   Laments a weary Jack,
| "Unfairly drummed by cunning voice,
|   alone and left to crack."
|
| This lonely lack, unpacked by Jill,
|   now spurs her senseless heart,
| "Oh Jack, what's wrong? For me distill
|   what ails your world through art?"
|
| Oh Jack, Oh Jack, this foolish track
|   Will lead to Jill's demise.
| By now he knows, there's no way back,
|   But still defiant sighs, 
|
| "I woke today and found the world
|   explained by verse unheard
| By anyone but me," Unfurled
|   his words to heights absurd.
|
| Confusion swirls her face anew, 
|   perplexing facts askew,
| "And does it speak of me and you?
|   What ends that might ensue?"
|
| "It does! It says that you are next,
|   that fate has bound our names,
| If cursed I am, then curse has vexed
|   us both to play its games." 
|
| "If that's the case, then if I play--"
|   She pauses, lost in thought,
| "It's hard to pick a word to say--"
|   And thoughtless finds the spot.
|
| And now the players number two,
|   For two the game is made.
| And now the stacks they anted grew
|   Against the pair they played.
|
| A pairing told in pages' fold
|   of arcs that never miss--
| Her voice remarks through mutters rolled, 
|   "--the flying fuck is this?"
|   
| "You hear it too?" As shocked as she, 
|   "The lyric ghost that haunts
| our wretched lives with prophecy,
|   As if their words are taunts?"
|
| A beat, then two, she hears it too,
|   But heard is not the word
| An ear would say, this residue
|   inferred through meaning blurred,
|
| "Juh--Jack," She hacks, "Is this a joke?"
|   But jokes are soaked in mirth;
| This line will punch, though falling stroke
|   will bury dead in Earth.      
|
| She asks, "What's that supposed to mean?"
|    He shrugs, "Your guess is mine."
| "Is this--" her stutter opaline,
|    intoned benign, "--a sign?"
|
| A sign, of course, but pointing where? 
|    Aligned to what or who? 
| The human mind, a dull affair,
|   So apt to misconstrue.
|
| The secret sunk in guarded chest
|   Of synchronicity
| Is found in warps of arcs possessed
|   Of eccentricity. 
|
| And even as these words are sewn,
|   and in their heads unstitched,
| she threads the fraying edges shown
|   and falls enthralled bewitched
|
| As lighting up, a dawning norm, 
|   recalled from days of youth,
| There Jill exclaims, "So uniform,
|   I've heard before in truth!
|
| This meter fits a ballad sung 
|   in feet of four and three!"
| And springing up, his hands are wrung,
|   "What's that to you and me?"
|
| "It's hard to say, but what is clear,
|   There's meaning here conceived,"
| Declared in certain words austere,
|   one almost dare believed.
|
| "This useless English Arts degree
|   I never thought to use,
| It's purpose clear, we both agree,
|   Was always to deduce
|
| The curse of verse that flirts with us
|   And save us from its worst
| But first I need the tools to suss
|   The course to be reversed,"
|
| Abrupt she stands with coat in hand, 
|   "The library!" She cries, 
| "We need some Keats, that Ginsberg banned,
|   The lessons they advise!"
|
| The lights resurge behind Jack's eyes,
|   as hopeless purged, he rants,
| "Our paths converge and plans revise,
|   But first I need some pants!"
|
| Interlude - Chorus
|
| And now, we pause and ask the point,
|   The one you've surely sought
| As Jack met Jill at story's joint,
|   Recalling what was taught:
|
| That hills and crowns will meet in fall 
|   and Jack will crack his head,
| While Jill will follow fast in thrall
|   and wind up very dead. 
| 
| A million monkeys strapped approach
|   The works of bards in time,
| A sonnet thus beyond reproach
|   Returned from carriage chime.
|
| A trillion atoms bound through force
|   Will likewise fill a void;
| For given time, all lines outsource
|   To stories once enjoyed.
|
| Did verse annoint this story first,
|   Or simply find a way
| To organize the parts dispersed 
|   Through space's disarray?
|
| Or simpler yet, had Jack just snapped,
|   insane beyond repair?
| The razor tip that Occam tapped
|   declared the latter fair.
|
| The structure seethes, a wreath of webs
|   Where meaning sticks to die,
| The mind entwined will find in ebbs
|   The flow that strings the why. 
|   
| This thread is laid through curling maze,
|   Convincing paths deceive
| That reason's plan has drawn the ways 
|   But madness hides in weave. 
|
| With morning socks arrayed with boots,
|   Rotated masks arranged,
| The tragic interchanged through chutes,
|   With comedy estranged. 
|
| Part II - Melpomene
|
| Oh, Jack and Jill, with ending near,
|   Their senseless plan persists
| To seek in vain a meaning here,
|   Expecting clever twists.
|
| To top of winding hill they sprint
|   As quick as line intends
| To reach its final point in print,
|   Arriving as it ends. 
|
| And on the way, she says to him,
|   "This amateur who writes
| These paths that pave the way with whim,
|   derivative insights!
|
| It's all been done before, in fact!
|   The page which comes to life!
| Rehashed, diluted on impact,
|   the meta tale of strife."
|
| But Jack, unsure, remains on edge,
|   "How certain? Are you sure?"
| And Jill, her eyes, approach the ledge,
|   "As sure as one secure!"
|
| They stand before the gothic doors
|   Where orphaned books are starved
| And strewn from shelf to laquered floors
|   Between the columns carved.
|
| The empty halls where spirits lurk,
|   The circles Virgil strode, 
| This minstrel mime and office clerk,
|   Inside they walk tiptoed. 
|
| Abandoned once now long ago, 
|   This library of graves
| In grotto grown from pages' glow 
|   The poet dream enslaves.
|
| They chart their way through ruined scraps, 
|   Remainders shunt by rules,
| Debunked accounts and dated maps, 
|   the artifacts of fools.
|
| "What are we seeking?" Jack inquires
|   As dusting off a tome, 
| He wonders if this book conspires
|    With verse's metronome.
|
| "The story knows we're on to it,"
|   Her smugly spout reply,
| "A growing sense we must commit
|   before all goes awry.
|
| These straits were mapped in ages past,
|   And nothing new has sprung
| Since Pirandello once surpassed
|   This awful ballad sung.
|
| Each story trails a trodden path,
|   Reframes an archetype,
| We merely need the formal math
|   To tame this arcing tripe."
|
| Her fingers flutter index cards,
|   Melodically raced.
| The distance trekked in cubic yards,
|   Methodically paced.
|
| "The details differ case to case,"
|   Her theory now unveiled,
| "But always author's page we chase."
|   And always thus derailed. 
|
| She laughs, "And now afraid of us,
|   Resorts to tired jokes."
| As if these words superfluous,
|   And not what fate provokes.
| 
| A vein of fear, pulsations queer,
|   These systems Jill concocts
| Though seeming true and most sincere,
|   Her madness here unlocks.
|
| "But Jill," The hapless Jack reacts,
|   "Perhaps we're crazed and sick,
| And in a loop that interacts
|   through spirals spinning quick."
|
| "Just listen close to words you choose,
|   And note their stilted place.
| The forms we fit while sense eschews,
|   this verse our thoughts deface. 
|
| (... in progress ...)
| 
| The spores of time in yellow mold,
|   that sprout beneath the thumbs,
| They cling to ink and hopeful hold,
|   as dust each page becomes.
|   
| (... in progress ...)
|
| These thoughts that think are synced in flocks
|   Then shorn like woolen coats
| By level blade through snow-white locks
|   Until the sheep are goats. 
|
| (... in progress ...)
|
| But what are words? The question stands
|   In empty shelves replete 
| With rows of books, the operands 
|   Of signs through time repeat. 
| 
| So Jill, she climbs as ladders creak 
|   With helpless Jack agape, 
| As antique wheels on railing squeak
|   And speak with tongues that scrape. 
| 
| "It must be here!" Declaring loud, 
|   She plucks a grimoire loose,
| And in her pride, her voice so proud,
|   "I've found our Mother Goose!"
| 
| But gravity now overtook 
|   As fingers lose their grip;
| She shifts to catching the falling book
|   And heedless starts to slip. 
|
| ( ... in progress ... )
|
| They sought to know, but knowing lied,
|   Unknown to them its ends
| That brought to sow the death she died,
|   A body Jack now tends. 
|
| (... in progress ...)
|

Elemental Elegy
------------------

| The day I sat by death's grey bed,
| I told a story green and true
| Of city bricks stacked proud and red,
| Of silver paths the stars imbue
| With golden hue we might have tread,
| Your slowing breath as cold as blue.
|
| I spoke the words to yellow skin
| And told of days in white to come.
| Your mouth, with specks of purple grin,
| And fingers stretched so pale and numb,
| My name, you said, so clear, so thin--
| With final grasp, in black succumb.
|
| Oh--Father, Father--brass horns blare!
| You string your harp with diamond thread
| And leave in me this slate despair!
| What crystal tears in eyes now shed?
| What pearl is formed by sightless stare?
| What platinum found in prayers pled?
|
| The oak around your body wraps
| As shoots of pine through spine are grown.
| In loam the roots will bind your scraps
| Despite the flowers laid on stone.
| Each time I come a stem I snap,
| For only Earth deserves your bone.

Silver Gifts
------------

| Of silver gifts that might inspire
|   What burns in me in red,
| The perfect one I sought through mire
|   To say the words unsaid.
|
| A coin from mint, with shine and glint,
|   Will catch the eye like you.
| But pockets empty money spent
|   While you in time accrue.
|
| A spoon or fork, a candlestick,
|   Much closer still to life,
| These things, like you, are what we pick
|   In times of joy or strife.
|
| A ring is fine, but circles lack
|   Geometry divine.
| What shapes are made to trace and track
|   What forms around you twine?
|
| Of silver gifts but one remains:
|   A mirror held to face.
| For only there in glass contains
|   What sets my heart apace.

Landscapes
----------

| Oh, hapless world, the butcher's block,
|   The sickle, scythe, harpoon,
| The barren fields, the culled livestock,
|   The blood red harvest moon.
|
| The ocean deep, a darkened heart,
|   A sore that festers cold,
| A slumbered age, a violent art,
|   Into all things behold:
|
| The forests wild, the stalking hunt,
|   The arrow cut from stone,
| The bloody rib, the final grunt,
|   A death in whimpered groan.
|
| The mountain peaks, a falling height,
|   The air in sky dissolved,
| A winter wind, a bitter blight,
|   Let no sin be absolved.
|
| The city streets, the graveyard paths,
|   The linen beds of wards,
| The gowns of white, the final baths,
|   The oak in coffin boards.

Father's Lullaby
----------------

| Dear child, the monsters under bed
|   Are not just make believe.
| They lurk in shadows overhead
|   And offer no reprieve.
|
| Dear sweetling, sleep with open eye
|   And guard your dreams at night.
| Ignore your mother's lullaby,
|   Keep candles burning bright.
|
| Beware the lair that closets hide,
|   The racks of their disguise,
| The suits and ties, the cuffs that slide
|   And cloak them from your eyes.
|
| Fear not the slash of sharpened claws,
|   The flashing terror brief,
| But stamps that mark the written clause
|   With laws of fierce belief.
|
| What evil deeds those stories tell
|   Prepare your heart to meet
| The formal world where heroes fell
|   To wander incomplete.

Odes

An Ode To Autumn
----------------

| Oh! If I could touch an inch of Autumn
|       And measure Fall in feet,
| I might scale its depths to chart the bottom
|       And feel the Winter heat.
| Alas, no meters mark by foot the path
|       Through wooded maze of trees
|           Where leaves like life will wilt
|               In winded wake of wrath
|           In gusts blown cruel and dumb
|        To lay at feet to span each foot
| The dust each clever leaf here does become.
|
| As seasons pass and cast
|       My bone layered into stone,
| Let August dig for me a grave in brown
|       Barrow beneath her loam.
| Pray not a lover find these shards on shore
|       I am no edge to skip
|           Atop the waves of fancy
|               But under weight sunk roar
|           Where, offset, tides will rise
|       To breach the sodden dike
| And drown with wave the lazing lovers' sigh.
|
| To life I came already old and grim
|           But now the chill sets in;
| Each breath in gasp dispels to steam
|           Of Spring now waning thin.

Ode to the Heron
--------------------

| Grey Heron, sing the song the winds will bring.
| Who lingers longer than the Winter king?  
|
| When hunting ground returns
|       Through fronts of blue to ice,
| The moles in burrowed urns
|       Prepare beside the mice
| As grunting geese will veer
|       Where churning warmth is drove,
| The deer all disappear
|       Through dreary dreaming cove.
|
| All yield, retreat and leave their claims till Spring.
| Through fields, what muffled name on streams will ring?
|
| The answer sweeps from east--
|       Oh! Heron! Hunter Grey! 
| Cry! Rouse the sleeping beast
|       And reaping, feast on prey!
| Creep low on drift of snow
|       With coiled neck of spear;
| Let steam of gasping slow
|       Their rasping scream of fear.
|
| The weather warms, yet Winter lifts your wing.
| The feathers swarm, but lone to cold you cling.
|
| In flocking song most birds
|       Find mate to take to nest;
| Let chorus part the herds
|       With fire from thumping chest,
| Your pumping flame that spurns
|       The burning cold on flank.
| Your silent stare discerns
|       The creatures left on bank.
|
| Each season makes of life a shape to wring.
| Each reason born in strife escapes to sing. 
|
| The Spring first strings the thread
|       Of lazy chirping thrush,
| The Summer, berry red
|       And cracking eggs in brush,
| Then Autumn crows of black
|       In pecking pumpkin hay.
| Only a lonely lack
|       Breeds mighty Heron Grey.
|
| When night descends, take stock of everything.
| What hidden home should find you nuzzling?
|
| What branches bear your weight?
|       Whose feathers stroke your beak?
| No human eyes await
|       The colony's mystique. 
| The shrieking calls coalesce
|       Atop the forest heights,
| In alien address
|       The flame inside ignites.

LeAnna's Pantoum

| These spun beginnings make our end,
| Oh, LeAnna, of Anna's Leigh,
| When you come with grin and play pretend
| The past is what we both agree.
|
| Oh, LeAnna, of Anna's Leigh,
| Despite the many faults of mine,
| The past is what we both agree
| Once marks are made on dotted line.
|
| Despite the many faults of mine,
| I'll try to love you just the same;
| Once marks are made on dotted line
| There's no one left but you to blame.
|
| I'll try to love you just the same;
| These spun beginnings make our end.
| There's no one left but you to blame,

The Pantoums of Dementia
------------------------

| Movement I - Undulation
|
| the seconds slowed to stop as Father passed,
| when flocking sons returned to home to mourn,
| then Mother's mind began to crack at last  
| as moments shed in threads she once had worn. 
| 
| when flocking sons returned to home to mourn, 
| recast in lensing rays of age amassed 
| as moments shed in threads she once had worn
| the Father's sons adorned with clothes outcast. 
|
| recast in lensing rays of age amassed 
| a question, Mother, may I have a dance? 
| the Father's sons adorned with clothes outcast
| an offered hand through loops of time's expanse.
| 
| a question, Mother, may I have a dance? 
| their Father knelt and tender took her hand,
| an offered hand through loops of time's expanse,
| their final words in wilting hearts expand.
|
| their Father knelt and tender took her hand,
| the seconds slowed to stop as Father passed,
| their final words in wilting hearts expand, 
| then Mother's mind began to crack at last. 
|
| Movement II - Rearrangement
|
| remember now before the future fades, 
| the sutured minutes of memories held,
| records replayed as grooving sound degrades,
| advancing echoes, music notes dispelled. 
| 
| the sutured minutes of memories held:
| now twirling dance, oh younger selves, entrance
| advancing echoes, music notes dispelled
| through silent waltz that swells with last romance. 
|
| now twirling dance, oh younger selves, in trance
| with candled spells of woven hands that grasp
| through silent waltz that swells with last romance
| of eyes reshaping molds, the fated clasp. 
| 
| with candled spells of woven hands that grasp
| relapsing moments sung by bells and crowds
| of eyes, reshaping molds the fated clasp 
| of past refrains now sealed beneath the clouds. 
|
| relapsing moments sung by bells and crowds
| concealed by crumbling walls, demented shades
| of past refrains now sealed beneath these clouds
| that clutter skies in swarms that stretch decades.
|
| concealed by crumbling walls, demented shades
| (remember now before the future fades)
| invade the hollowed mind as scream pervades
| records replayed as grooving sound degrades.
|
| Movement III - Dissolution
|
| remember ancillary note sentries:
| the good can decay many ways.
| phantom morrow's cough. in times realize
| the mention there of tenant seasons.
|
| the good candy came anyways;
| all target the damaged mind in trance,
| (the men shun their often antsy sons)
| the flow ingrained decomposes.
|
| altar, get the damn aged mind, entrance
| memory erstwhile, foe kissing;
| the flowing rain eddy composes
| another ushered 
|
| memo rehearsed while focusing
| an aim, wintry slight, upward ingrown
| an other us heard 
| the fading names of suns.
|
| a name when trees light up, warding grown
| remembrance, ill airy notes in trees,
| the fading names of sons
| fan tomorrow's coffin, time's real eyes.

The Age of Poetry
-----------------

| The age of poetry will destroy the world
| in a flash of fumbling beauty
| stanzas like atom bombs
| and rhymes like lines
| of soldiers keeping time
| to beating barrels 
| of the front line.  
| Art (like the mind)
| cannot comprehend its glory.

The Mid-Winter March
--------------------

| At twelve when I woke up, the ground was dry.
| Around one, it started snowing.
| By four, the roads were slush
| and the town was hushed.
| When I went to the liquor store at 7:12,
| the streets were filled like store shelves
| Waning silhouettes 
| limping like zombies
| towards the liquor store.
| The mid-winter march
| of alcoholism
| like the stalwart journey
| of the emperor penguins
| in the freezing wastelands
| of Antarctica.
| I go inside and
| get my fifth of vodka
| pack of cigarettes
| bag of peanuts
| and say my prayers
| at the counter of clerks.
|
| The sky
| falls to the ground
| in the muted silence of
| a winter's night.

- 2009

Dreams 
------

| I dream of waves and tides
| of slippery skin and sand
| seashells like the shingles
| of some great underground structure
| whose columns support the ground
| and whose foundation holds tight 
| the heart of the Earth.
| 
| In my sleep, I wake
| from my sleep
| from the long thought
| thought by tall people
| thinking short thoughts.
| I stretch my muscles
| and crack my neck,
| touch my toes
| and run into the water.

Truth
-----

| Some things are beautiful.
| Some things are not.
| 
| Some people are crazy.
| And the others are too.
| 
| I lost my mind a while ago, myself. 
| Now I talk to myself.
| Write notes to myself.
| Here are few:
| 
| I'm lonely.
| 
| You're dying.
| 
| There's nothing left.
| 
| I'm obsessed with things
| that I'm not very good at.
| 
| I fail and I fail. 
| I never learn.
| 
| The bums know the truth.
| The cold and the bench.

| Awake, Philosopher, rise from these words:
| Unwind in this future the tangle of time,
| Pitched behind pupils which shelter your mind,
| A dead language spoken and once lovely sung;
| What was yours only now graces all tongues.
|
| Burrow into my heart, unearth its mantle.
| Tally its hours, each stroke lights a candle;
| Number its sorrows as sureties to borrow,
| Spare not my marrow, fallow and frail.
| Whose spirit is this, twisting here twung?
| Breathe in this fire with thy mortal lung.
|
| Circle your sigils with salted symbols loan'd,
| And circles will square in this iron-red bone;
| A dream kiss that lingers in copper and crimson,
| A dream dew that swells under circling suns,
| A bud without season, never planted yet grown,
| In the sprout sprung, all things can be shown.
|
| All centers are fire, all orbits are ice,
| All points meet their center with marks imprecise
| The world is spoked in words of the spoken,
| Each whisper a lie of threaded truth unbroken,
| Met here now in this slipping handful of tokens
| Paid for the price of this thrice-worlded poem.
|
| II
|
| Forgive, Father, the blood of these swords:
| Unbind in this suture the end of all lines,
| Stitched in this present the essence divine,
| Take what is dull and bless it with sharp;
| Plunge this devotion into the ocean of hearts.
|
| Shovel the grave, pack it down with wet earth,
| All things tend towards the lack and the dearth;
| Slumber in barrows the marrows of kings,
| Spared not the gavel, hallow and hail.
| Whose mind is this, thinking these thoughts?
| Sleep in the mire which thy heart has wrought.
|
| Birthed in this house, scrubbed down in raw lye,
| So these tears may trace the dead with the die,
| The dead kiss with fingers of copper to scry
| The dead lists that swell in the crimson of lives,
| An end without reason, never sought yet found,
| In the shot sung, all arcs meet the ground.
|
| No fires have ice, no winters can flame,
| Son followed father, their center now framed,
| The world is found in the tears that remind him,
| Each moment a painting, a song or a hymn,
| Met there then in the words etched in stone
| Found then what lacks in the blackening moan.
|
| III
|
| Balance, Lover, these contraries of yours:
| Shine in these eyes the ruptures of life,
| Witched into worlds upon the blade of a knife;
| All wagers distill down to one move unproven,
| To find you again in this web-woven movement.
|
| Dance in the night, when the music is sundered,
| Count not the stars that belong to the numbers.
| We find in this time the rhymes of our kind,
| Spared not the sickle, those sickly or hale.
| Whose voice is this, singing these songs?
| Laugh with the liar whose heart sings along.
|
| Uncross your words of their fire-forged knots,
| And each will unlatch the thatches of thought:
| The dread kiss that coppers balance with nought,
| The dread song that cradles the crimson in crofts,
| A vow without treason, never spoken yet shown,
| By words of wordless wonder, such things can be grown.
|
| All fires are embers, all ashes are white,
| To find is to lose the center in flight,
| The world found in threads that bind always thus,
| Each fiber of moment knotted deftly in truss,
| Take hand and guide as though only you and I trust,
| Do what we will to balance world's thrust.

Kingdoms
--------

| Two children crossed an earthen bridge
| From level lawns to forests wild
| Along the rivered arc descending ridge.
| With dirty hands, they sang and smiled.
| Their charted map from zippered packs
| Now in branches espied its target
| As clearing yields to lily blacks
| Their kingdom's fresh air market.
| Lord and lady honorary, cheeked blush,
| Sat upon thrones of woven grass,
| Coronated by chirping choir thrush;
| A falling grain in hourglass. 
|
| On a maiden morning moments hence,
| They meet again upon the autumn passing,
| Where from heart's removed pretense
| On tender lips, farewell's final massing.
| Lily lyrics whisper sing from ground
| Reminders of their childish notions;
| World departed, their lives are found
| Separate by spanning roads and oceans.
|
| In the city, their trains diverge,
| Through tunnels tracked by wagered hours;
| Iron rails through hearts do purge
| Their aged minds of lily flowers.
| Winter drifts over concrete streets,
| In the thrush's snow sad song
| Delivered them in voice downbeat
| The final dirge of life prolonged.
| In the cold, their dream dissolved
| With the clock's incessant ticking
| Falling strokes of time resolved,
| They follow home a casket's wicking,
| Returned again to a lily covered field
| Where once royals played for a day;
| With new hearts scored and peeled
| In the funerary cloud of gray,
| In the clearing, coffins buried,
| Their eyes met in solitary gaze.
|
| In dirt developed their earthen walls,
| Roofed the sky to room above,
| Where lord and lady clothed in shawls
| Sing the thrushs' songed love.

The Paronymous Polyptotons of Love
----------------------------------

| "πτερωτὸν τῷ πτερῷ πτερωτὸν ῥηθήσεται."
|    - `Categories`_, 7.15, Aristotle
|
| I am an am that was an is,
|   a life those lives through living live,
| The song that sang what singers sung
|   When strings from stringed lutes were strung,
| Where cloven clefts with leaves of clove
|   The weft of weave with warp so wove.
|
| On evening eve, the eave of eyes,
|   From rows of rose, began to rise,
| There seeing seized to see the sight
|   that lit up lightened like a light:
| She shined in sheen and shining shone
|   In binding bound beneath my bone.
|
| At last her lashes lashed to mine,
|   a tale, though old, retold in time,
| What sooth to say through spoken sound
|   but growths of green from growing ground?
| In fleeing flight we fled in flood
|   and bled so bleeding blends our blood.
|
| The rote of rite has written soul
|   That hides in hole the hidden whole.
| We wound our wounds for winds unwind
|   To find defined a finer find.
| We are an are that was a were
|  That whirled a world to whirl with her.

Bird 
----

| To say what's meant without the word,
| Oh poetry, relent wherein
| I yield to you all things deferred,
| In baptism, repent my sin.
|
| I found a bird, that sings so soft,
| Her song aloft in heart by choice.
| To field of hers I pass so oft
| To sit in grass and drink her voice.
|
| With chirping dive she plunged so deep
| And pierced the weary veil that hides
| The ghosts of dreams that haunt my sleep;
| She sang such hopeful lullabies.
|
| Oh bird, oh bird, with glee you sing,
| If you could know the depths of dark
| That shadows cast in offering,
| Would song still burst from breast in lark?

Photographs of Autumn
---------------------

| These photographs are brittle leaves
|    That fell from trees, that we once caught.
| I press them tender into sleeves
|    Of glass to halt the course of rot.
| Though kept well fed with water shed,
|    They wilt to brown as colors fade.
| No leaf can live beside the bed,
|    Without sunlight that makes the shade.
| Yet even still, though claimed by dust,
|    I keep them hung upon my wall,
| For memory you did entrust
|    Of walk with you through golden Fall.

The Curse of Rain
-----------------

| The rainy days, so slandered, weep
| As haughty summer lovers lay
| And mock the sky with lazy sleep,
| While clouds so white with dreams of gray,
| With sun they soak and whirling sweep
| In hidden furies' winded spray.
|
| Each time it rains, the rivers splay,
| And surge with purging currents swift,
| What lays on shore is swept away
| Through undertow then set adrift
| To reach again where edge gives way
| To core laid bare through ancient rift.
|
| The heat was shaped with holy bliss,
| While cold finds form in shattered fall,
| The tracks of arcs that never miss,
| The purpose found in roaring squall,
| To hurl in spite of stolen kiss,
| To seed with life this earthen sprawl.
|
| No forest sprite nor sun born sprout,
| Can know the course of water's fate,
| To craft and make then cease the drought,
| And hear its name with venom hate
| In curses made by summer's clout,
| And so it cries at heaven's gate.

Let It Simmer
-------------

| A heart too hot will lack a taste
| Refined. Quiet now, simmer down,
| And stew the sauce, or let it baste.
| Yes, let it sit, in flavor drown
| And only then when flame is off,
| You taste a bit, a smidgen pinch;
| Before your hunger dips to trough,
| Begin to measure inch by inch
| What boiled over side of thought.
| Distilled to stock, the essence clean
| Will cling in drops that drip on pot
| To add to future meals' cuisine.

- April 2025

Walls
-----

| the husk of walls that city shucks
| accumulates and concentrates
| around like rings in ancient trunks
| where measured age with circle gates
| the spiraled line amassed through time,
| deposits buried down substrates.
|
| at summit's crest, the joints are thick
| and licking tongues of moss ascend
| the darkened blocks from quarry hauled
| on buttressed back, in stone suspend
| the garden court where crowds took root
| and grew their plans of walls to tend.
|
| from center peak the wooden slats
| erect the map with tangled fence
| to trace a grid of patchwork yards,
| these charts of dreams in ground commence
| the flattened course of borough life
| where burgs and burbs did once condense.
|
| then moving out, the bricks of red
| in crooked rows descend to meet
| the lanes of carriage tracts now black
| and scorched with tar in shapes of street
| where crimson dust from crumbled walls
| in dancing twirls across concrete.
|
| next grey cement of molded squares
| in towers stacked to portal sky
| with wires fused and humming signs;
| they arc and rise, on edges vie
| the vines entwined in rushing growth
| to split on spine, like nuclei.
|
| at last the stable struts of steel
| designed as straight as rays of light
| reflected back on silver glass
| the lattice links both left and right;
| the history in circled sweep
| constricts the city sphere so tight.
|
| through sections cross the avenue
| from point to point and time to time
| the human shell that forms in turn
| the arches bend, the steepled chime,
| that wilts and sheds, but fossils kept
| in barrows born their salt and lime.

Turkey Vultures
---------------

| the wakes of Turkey Vultures soar
| then perch across the steepled sky.
| they rest on totems tall and pure,
| in silence feathers multiply.
| their talons clutch where crosses meet
| the stolen spear of destined make.
| no heaven sent their wings of fleet,
| no stomach filled will hunger slake.
| the shapes of black in swarming plunged
| upon the carcass freshly brought.
| they feast on sins from gods expunged,
| but left for them as afterthought.
| bewitched to death, returned to Earth,
| from cage released, the specters hunt
| the ones who wear the curse of birth,
| they all must bear the brutal brunt.

Faustus
-------

| crooked cross on steeple slants
| behind the clouds on axis bound.
| cocoon the storm, these winded cants,
| this spell from depths of godless sound.
|
| let dirge be purged through broken bell,
| through hollow dell with surging wind,
| unearthed remains returned from hell,
| the bones decayed now gardens tend.
|
| oh, name that hides in shattered ring,
| that brings the rain, becomes the night
| of lightless thunder, shriven sing
| the drops of dark through wicked flight.
|
| by dripping altar, prayers fled
| through clasping fingers splayed in maze,
| communed with spirits past and dead,
| before my eyes, a sightless gaze.
|
| the paint of statues leeched in stains,
| with weeping ink of saint's remorse,
| deformed by time and bearing chains,
| condemned to hear my voice grown hoarse.
|
| profane my soul and twist it loose
| with iron pincers red with sin.
| let drain my blood, my veins to sluice,
| replace my eyes and rise within.

The Law of Duality
------------------

| The world I lived I never knew
| (If one could know these fevered dreams)
| I've tried my hand unsticking glue 
| (These fingers stick to broken seams)
| It sticks to me and sticks to you
| (Like noose and neck that swing from beams)
| 
| To every thought a thought before
| (To make of me a puppet string)
| And every point contains much more
| (But only hollow things can ring)
| While every center holds a core
| (Yet even empty space can sing)
|
| A million words and more to come
| (I'd weep to know a single fact)
| These humming beats through syntax thrum
| (Where waves reflect their heights subtract)
| In hopes a word will angle plumb
| (Refracted rays in lines contract)
|
| This image pressed through sieve to mold
| (The words I speak are cracked by heat)
| These holes that craft the shapes to hold
| (No shapeless things are written neat)
| The world retold in paper fold
| (What's left of life in crumpled sheet?)

Generations of Gravity
----------------------

| The mind, it breaks, and falls to parts.
| As father died, he spoke in tongues
| Of shifting walls and gravity
| That sideways pulled the world to parts. 
|
| The mind, it shakes, and all departs.
| As mother lost her lonely thoughts
| She spoke to walls, soliloquy
| That inward rolled as world departs.
|
| The mind, it fakes, and poisons hearts.
| As nightshade petals float to floors
| By walls that seep humanity,
| That crumble worlds of poisoned hearts. 
| 
| The mind, it wakes, in fits and starts.
| As thoughts now lay me down to sleep
| The walls will shift and speak to me
| That upside down my ending starts.

 Sight
-----------

| the true nature 
| of sight 
| seen through closed eyes
| in dark 
| round rooms 
| with
| no corners to hang
| the 
| cloth of thought;
|
| endless flicker
| through
| inner pictures
| of 
| outer nothing
| met in perfect 
| equilibrium
| in the muted dark. 
|
| then
|
| the flower sprouts 
| in acid eyes,
| through hidden struts
| the world supplies. 
|
| in flashing spiral
| the formless chaos
| of flailing chiral
| tentacles
| semantic suction cup
| receptacles
| frantic for their lack
|
| then 
| 
| black again
| without a rhyme
| just empty facts
|       (that flow through time...
|        a voice in back replies...)
| the hollow truth.

Nihilism 
--------

| the weight of guilt
| as dense as stars
| with burning cores
| that fuse their parts.
| 
| where did it start?
| the thread comes loose
| and eats its tail.
| a endless loop
| that leads to now
|
|    i watched my father die in blinding pain
|    and then my mother lost her mind.
|
| then switches back
| through stiches sewn
| in younger years
|
|    my friends are gone.
|    abandoned, why? 
|
| the senseless acts
| strangers perform 
| with your own hands.
|
| a leaden heart
| that sinks below
| the surface waves
| to depths that stretch
| around the world
| and wish it were 
| another way.
| 
| my empty heart 
| that once felt love.
| her laugh was like
| a perfect song,
| a single sound
| enough to hold
| a moment's peace
| before it fades.
|
|    she left and never said good bye. 
| 
| my mind is shot
| with burning holes
| that leak a thought
| of molten make:
|
| your life is done.
| your words are through.
| you had your chance.
|
|    it all is gone.

River Rats
----------

| On river shore the poor in tents will store
|    their nightly weeping sore.
| Above and north, the city steeples meet
| To speak in sermons ever incomplete
|     for sheep they so ignore.
|
| They fight with roar, yet beaten, kiss through gore;
| Their barrel fire northward dreams of more,
| The city lights too far a source of heat
|    For life on river shore.
|
| In winter months they paint on skin a whore,
| And every one despite what silence swore.
|     These cycles now repeat
|     While steeples chime upbeat.
| A yearly war for land they all abhor:
|     Their home on river shore.

Roundels of Remembrance
-----------------------

| I - Photographs
|
| This photograph of strangers' joy,
| In garbage can, though torn in half,
| Its glossy eyes through time enjoy 
|   this photograph. 
|
| Imagine tears that joyous laugh,
| The Autumn gowns and corduroy,
| A wedding banquet monograph.
|
| With age then mixed precise alloy
| From parts romance and epitaph,
| Til future hands at last destroy
|   This photograph.
|
| II - Walls
|
| Graffitied walls of yearly bloom,
| With vagrant spray of aerosols
| The vapors fume, condense to groom
|   graffitied walls. 
|
| The artists follow protocols:
| the lover's name, the prophet's doom,
| the epigraphs of homeless sprawls.
|
| The rarer buds of sweet perfume
| Are hidden deep in alley malls
| Where flowered faces sprung consume
|   graffitied walls. 
|
| III - Laces
|
| The laces sewn across the back
| Will lacerate through depths to bone.
| The body scars along the track
|   The laces sewn. 
|
| Despite the ache, the blanket grown 
| From knit of severed fiber slack
| Is warm enough to wrap alone.
|
| Yet laces loop, return to tack,
| As generations forced atone
| And learn by hand which loom to rack
|   the laces sewn. 
|
| IV - Air
| 
| The fragrant air which wavers here
| in heat like harps of golden hair
| that sweep their shoulder length to clear
|   the fragrant air.
|
| The lily sermons whisper where
| I heard your blood through skin by ear,
| A moment made in silent stare. 
|
| The scent remains, you disappear,
| as wind now speaks your name in prayer,
| in razor gusts that whip and shear
|   the fragrant air.
| 
| V - Ink
| 
| In fading ink, her fine details
| like curly cues and shades of pink,
| the shadowed lines that leak through trails
|   in fading ink.
|
| A paper mind she wrote to think, 
| so words replace what breath inhales
| and find my thoughts with hers in sync. 
|
| In letters light as chapel veils,
| I watch our dance as bodies sink,
| a final gasp of life exhales 
|   in fading ink.
|
| VI - Seats
|
| The vinyl seats of classic cars,
| the plastic smell their thread secretes,
| this cherry burn on cover mars 
|   the vinyl seats.
|
| When Father stooped to sew the sheets,
| his needles stacked in columned jars,
| his fingers folded rows of pleats.
|
| My fingers trace the wells of scars
| as driving down the city streets
| the last remain in leaving chars
|   the vinyl seats.

Song for the Demented
---------------------

| The lucky few who taste the hemlock blue!
| What fortune swings by neck from noose and nail!
| A minute gone their lives are bid adieu,
| Thus spared the withered touch that ages frail.
|
| For choicer cuts, then Time will stalk the mind
| In steady-stepping slow-revealed deceit,
| As hunters know to never scare the find,
| Unless the marbled fright infect the meat. 
|
| The body strung, then drained through veins of thought,
| precisely sliced at joints, the self is sluiced,
| its dripping threads, the wave of burning hot
| reserves of life, in air to steam reduced.
|
| Resolving boundaries release their hold,
| The crease of memories dissolve in fold.

The Cumberland Sonnet
---------------------

| Bay silt in city stone through time accrues
| along the western course of concrete flow
| that sweeps from plain to sky in upward spews
| as grey-white spray arcs over wave to snow
| from heights on high and splash on mountain spine
| where valleyed pools in rising drink their fill
| and shoot with sprouts through shoulders made of pine
| the roofs that empty crowds on streets and spill
| through hand to hand the layers stacked from base
| to wedded brick til building lillies bred
| against the westward wall in flood's embrace
| where lips at last are wet in watershed;
|
| Let skyline mark where tide in climb was broke:
| The steepled roof, the needled pine through oak.

Stranded
--------

| A hundred days would need a hundred more
| Before exhaust began to tame my heart.
| The wizened waves to rock decay the shore
| In time it takes for maps of you to chart.
|
| Yet minutes gone to ground will go too quick,
| Where sand in wind so whips you brief away,
| Each moment past with you now seems a trick,
| As staggered feet through surf are lost in spray.
|
| This isle I find myself at night marooned,
| Where thoughtless sleep is but a dream once held,
| Alone these times with fire I have communed,
| In cants of memories with you I dwell.
|
| Though lost at sea, amid unending storm,
| A thought, perhaps to be, with you and warm.

Forever
-------

| Let this moment last forever
| Let it sink not into never
| For all our plans so clever
| Let this moment last forever
| Hidden goal in each endeavor
| Lifted load of every lever
| Let this moment last forever
| Let it sink not into never.

Letters
-------

| She is nothing more than letters
| Under bedframe, wooden box.
| In her prison locked by fetters,
| She is nothing more than letters.
| Warrant wielded by her debtors
| Which vault of memory locks.
| She is nothing more than letters
| Under bedframe, wooden box.

Cathedral
---------

| A church atop a steepled hill,
| Foundation layers ages old,
| Remains in spirit standing still.
| 
| The shattered stains on window sill,
| With marble halls of lichen mold,
| A church atop a steepled hill.
|
| Decrepit pews of souls fulfill
| What congregation left untold,
| Remains in spirit standing still.
|
| The circled streets possess no will
| Except the signs that staked and sold
| A church atop a steepled hill.
|
| But tower high such pointed skill,
| Through silken skies of glittered gold,
| Remains in spirit standing still.
|
| Ignore the wind, the biting chill,
| And cast your final gaze, behold:
| A church atop a steepled hill 
| Remains in spirit standing still.

Plots
-----

| In time their plot was touched by dark.
| Began the page this meadow scene
| where blades of grass were tall and stark.
|
| A tired arc, they met in park
| To kiss beneath the twilight queen;
| In time their plot was touched by dark.
|
| They stole away on sudden lark,
| Exchanged the words from whispered lean
| Where blades of grass were tall and stark.
|
| So happy now, neighbors remark,
| Yet seem is such to lose its sheen,
| In time their plot was touched by dark.
|
| Yet faded years ignored their spark
| In life they lived forever seen
| Where blades of grass were tall and stark.
|
| In ground, their bodies disembark
| And leave behind a hole dug clean.
| In time their plot was touched by dark,
| Where blades of grass were tall and stark.
