Research: Official Records of Anomalous Events

I am looking for official government documents (United States or otherwise) that contain suggestive quotes about the supernatural, the bizarre, the occult or the inexplicable. For example,

.. epigraph::

    CIA ... found such a facility at coordinates given by subject. Photos ... show large dish antennas. The number of antennas was different from that counted by subject and the dimensions slightly different ...

    In a double-blind experiment, subject was fed the coordinates of a small Soviet-occupied island in the Indian Ocean ... The island did not show on the map used by experimenters. In fact, the latter assumed the subject was being targeted against open ocean as a test. Subject began drawing a large scale map of an island, following its periphery. He soon ran off his sheet of paper, continued on another sheet, and continued this process until several separate sheets had been filled in, and subject had returned to his starting point. When the pages were joined together, the result was an exact match and an absolutely accurate topographical map of the island. Subject also described exactly what was going on on the island.

    Now that we have briefly profiled the basic mechanics of the principal techniques for altering or expanding consciousness which share some of the objectives and/or methods employed in the Gateway Experience, we may proceed to focus on what that technique actually involves. Fundamentally, the Gateway Experience is a training system designed to bring enhanced strength, focus and coherence to the amplitude and frequency of brainwave output between the left and right hemispheres so as to alter consciousness, moving it outside the physical sphere as as to ultimately escape even the restrictions of time and space. The participant then gains access to the various levels of intuitive knowledge which the universe offers.

.. epigraph::

    - They had (program manager talking) a craft -- an intact craft they believed could fly (space? air? water? dimensions?)
    - Was it from overseas or not? 
    - Said NO! Could not be -- not possible!
    - Why, I asked -- where did it come from?
    - Program manager said they didn't know where it was from [they had some ideas on this] -- it was technology that *was not of this Earth -- not made by human hands*.
    - Said were trying to understand and exploit technology;

Each of these qualifies as a topic I am interested in.
