Absurdity
---------

| One lovely Thursday afternoon
|   Two billion years ago,
| A star embraced by arcs of moons
|   Conceived despair and woe. 
| 
| A sordid joke of yellow-red,
|    Ribald and mocking jape:
| To burn with heat in circles dead
|    with no hope of escape
|
| So solace cursed upon a point,
|    it drew a mighty plan
| As spinning round its lock and joint
|    its ending now began.
| 
| The heaving mass of goo morassed
|    then gurgled once and sighed;
| A rattle scream of flames harassed
|    what silent void denied. 
| 
| The sacrificial rings were flung
|   in sprays across the sky;
| The interstitial threads then wrung
|   as ropes they bound untie.
|
| And in these fictions fracture facts:
|    A single atom forged
| And bellow blown through heaven's tracts
|    to find itself disgorged. 
| 
| The crush of black, once unobserved,
|    in fire found its sight.
| The atom woke from dreams unnerved
|    in sailing stream of flight. 
| 
| Without a frame, it screamed in vain
|    Through paralactic curves
| That weave the sieves with cluttered skein
|    Of dark galactic nerves. 
|
| Commotion drowned, it gazed about
|    along the ends it aimed:
| The bluest gem beyond a doubt
|    the cosmos ever named. 
| 
| It wept to see a brilliant Earth,
|    the fate bestowed by chance,
| And in its cackles rose a mirth
|    expressed in photon's dance. 
|
| It splashed the surface spinning fast,
|    now lost amid the sea. 
| The water rose at what trespassed,
|    mistook it for debris.
|
| The liquid swarm convened in waves,
|    to flood the tiny core.
| They stripped and pried, as hunger craves
|    and always wants for more. 
|
| The terror flashed, as pulled apart,
|   its briefly tasted life
| now disappeared before its start 
|   beneath the wetted knife. 
|
| So bittersweet, by shades complete, 
|   resigned into the black,
| the atom met its end on feet 
|   and braced for last attack.
|
| But fortune found where will converged,
|   as snatched from death it gasped
| And saw from depths the land emerged,
|   where brethren all were clasped.
|
| A molecule of carbon made
|   from crystal network cast
| through jointed links of atom braid
|   that helix ghosts amassed. 
|
| Began the age of afterbirth, 
|   of structure spat in space,
| originating blest on Earth,
|   atomic interface. 
|
| Now watch along the webbing sewn
|   the single atom weave
| Through warps and wefts and whetted stone,
|   the knits of stellar sleeve.

The Ballad of the Isle
----------------------

| I - Spring
| 
| I - March (Mutable Water)

| The island formed where rivers meet,
|   where silt through vortex fords.
| The place emerged a brokered feat, 
|   a land of met accords.
|
| A mantle crown, in breaching air,
|   the regents all proclaim
| a vessel poured from blooded heir
|   of season's last remain.
|
| So March the army sorties cease,
|   embarking east and west 
| to mark the chartered pact with peace,
|   obeisance paid and blessed.
| 
| Here pairs of fish in lunar sway
|    coordinate their fins
| in swooping ornament display
|    with flocking mirrored twins.
|
| Behold the treaty words in ink,
|   the scrolls in future's brine,
| the sutures binding swords in sync
|   to island's hallow shrine.
|
| II - April (Cardinal Fire)
|
| The webs of Spring such crude affairs
|   when strung with spinning songs;
| the threaded compromise ensnares
|   the spidered plotting throngs. 
|  
| The April session clauses creep
|   and wolves with sharpened claws,
| deceived by strategems of sheep,
|   retract their motioned laws.  
|
| But blurting rams befoul the ploy,
|   with filibuster bleets
| that break the still the ewes enjoy;
|   the argument repeats.
|
| To raven galleries' refrain
|    in rabble squalls of wind,
| they find in mutual disdain
|    their hopes together pinned. 
|
| Elusive votes are overcast 
|   on cloudy ballots posed.
| By noon, the forum order passed
|   conceded plans proposed.
|
| III - May (Fixed Earth)
|
| A barren hump prepared with zeal
|   as sparrows plow their seeds.
| From sprouted weed to plants' reveal
|   through curtains made of reeds. 
|
| The shoots are sunk and water sewn
|   through roots of flooded banks
| where mudded flanks of fish cyclone
|   around the studded ranks. 
| 
| A retinue arrives from sea
|   atop a snow-white bull.
| Its royalty with one decree
|   begins the reign in full.
|
| The trees then stake foundations firm,
|   cement what's broken free, 
| confirm the seed to bring to term
|   the squawking newborn plea.
|
| A birth announced to kneeling crowds
|   in congregation's girth, 
| by May pronounced through sealing clouds
|   of consecrated Earth.
|
| II - Summer
| 
| I - June (Mutable Air)
| 
| When stellar swans survey the dawn
|   of constellated shores,
| their forms in flight are downward drawn
|   towards gravitating cores. 
|
| They veer through plumes of pheromone,
|   converge at silent points.
| Diverging tracts, though yearly grown, 
|   lead back where June annoints.
|
| At last the Summer bursts with life
|   and summons forth its herds
| to open market pastures rife
|   with bounty born by birds. 
|  
| In shallows deer appear to graze
|   beside the lazing drapes
| of rays, the incandescent haze
|   that veils their swaying shapes.
|
| Then maiden buds unfold to bees 
|   their sweetly nectared heat;
| unladen, drowsy, through the breeze,
|   the teasing fumes secrete. 
|
| II - July (Cardinal Water)
|
| Along the flowing inlet streams 
|   the festival begins.
| Caressing music tinges dreams
|   with cricket violins.
|
| Soft underfoot the cancers tap,
|   enrapt by vibrant chords. 
| The snapping prance of shells enwrap
|   the island shore with hordes.
|
| As gondolas of lilies' bud
|   that carry courting toads
| through swampy bogs to ports of mud
|   relieve their tadpole loads.
|
| Oh! Jubilee, this boon, July
|   through fallow leas by moon,
| when rodents swoon in cups of rye 
|   and fall to bed too soon.
|
| Amid the revelry a kiss
|   to memory's delight,
| two larks alight in fading bliss
|   fulfill this final night. 
|
| III - August (Fixed Fire)
|
| What bittersweet perfumes release
|   in looming throes of age,
| when isle matures through orange cerise, 
|   engulfed in scents of sage.
|
| Though leonine its roar in youth,
|   the shedding source of mane
| replies with veins of blood vermouth
|   through suffocating grain.
|
| Of August lines that empire grew,
|   once cloaked in ermine garbs,
| unkempt and molting, flake sinew,
|   their branches wreathed in barbs.
|
| Though riches hide in golden limb,
|   the leaves dissolve to dust,
| consoled in wind to hushing skim
|   what wealth remains in gust. 
|
| Discreetly cloaked from time the Fall
|   of secret reign's decline
| through crimson's spectrum vine, all
|   gone brown, forgetting shine.
|
| III - Autumn
| 
| I - September (Mutable Earth)
|
| September storms suspend the skies
|   resplendent morning pinks
| above the waking window eyes
|   despairing foregone winks. 
| 
| What ears of wheat will balance scales? 
|   What maiden disappears? 
| Condensing answers dance in gales,
|   descending hemispheres.
|
| Now Autumn comes with heavy rain 
|   to test the borders drawn.
| The water drained from level plain
|   in flooding rose the dawn.
|
| The thunder heralds sundered age 
|   besieged by droplets fat 
| with blood of yearly plundered wage, 
|   enraged what Spring begat.   
| 
| What muddy lanes then sluice the drowned
|   debris and sweep from field
| the tumbling tumult, turned aground
|   and heaped by waves to wield.
|
| II - October (Cardinal Air)
|
| Divided sky once halved in poise, 
|   succumbs to blackened press,
| the hours compress to whiter noise
|   in surging strained excess.
|
| October chopping peaks depressed
|   through interlocking weeks
| deplete reserves that Summer stressed
|   to balking vassal shrieks. 
|
| Retreating columns' sullen flight,
|   deserting homes and kin, 
| the fleeing wash through rapids white
|   with waters steeped in sin.
|
| So inch by inch the tides reclaim
|   the island kingdom keep
| and cast it down without a name
|   to swirling depths of sleep.
|
| The atlas page is ripped anew,
|   schematic contour holes
| where once there rose a sprout to blue
|   now rising streams of souls. 
|
| III - November (Fixed Water)
|
| Orion's arrow point is plunged
|   through lunging fronts of hail
| across the waves where life expunged
|   remains through shadowed veil.  
|
| For down below, the stones make schemes
|   in skipping sprees like drunks,
| inlaid in sunken trees through seams
|   as ballast for their trunks.
| 
| Arise the turret towers stark
|   against the ruddered land 
| to touch the ceiling shuttered dark
|   and brace what sprawling spanned. 
|
| Beneath the surface flowers form
|   as shades of algae grow
| atop the castle walls in swarm,
|   the borough glade aglow.
|
| November's embers burn a while
|   between the exiled graves.
| Remembered nocturnes sung beguile
|   the damned, forgottten knaves. 
|
| IV - Winter
|
| I - December (Mutable Fire)
|
| A rending gale begins to blow
|   above where worlds still thrive.
| Descending sickles diving slow
|   as primal ends arrive.
|
| Let Winter lens of crystal glass
|   behold submerged the fast,
| alive with dancing ghosts en masse
|   retreading paths now past. 
|
| Its poison stings but lacks the kill,
|   the sweet paralysis
| of time stood still in languid chill
|   around the palaces. 
|
| The stasis holds in cold command 
|   the surface wraiths in play. 
| They turn to gems, encased expand
|   beyond the skinned decay. 
|
| Dissolved December center breaks, 
|   dismembered lattice links,
| upending states, revolving wakes;
|   the idle spirit shrinks. 
| 
| II - January (Cardinal Earth)
|
| The horns of plenty now cry a dirge
|   as prying cold enfolds
| the last remains from island's purge 
|   outcast from stable moulds.
|
| Through sieging vortices of shard
|    the kingdom yard is cleaved.
| Bombarding sheets of ice discard
|    in circles ruins sieved.
|
| What moments held in spells now spent
|   impels the course of freeze.
| The towers brought to knees repent,
|   now felled by Time's disease.
| 
| The afterlife morassed in cracks
|   of marrow twisted blue,
| the wighted bones of zodiacs
|   imbued with pallid hue.
|
| So seconds pass eternally,
|   this January clock.
| The island keep returns to sea
|   through grains of sand to chalk.
|
| III - February (Fixed Air)
|
| Yet February always brings 
|   the forest chorus lines,
| the chirping chickadee that sings 
|   from luted bows and vines. 
|
| From south, the scouting vees of geese,
|    with probes of swiveled neckcd 
| that follow fronts of warmth's caprice,
|    are promise-held in check.
|
| When Spring returns the tides recede,
|   but hollow urns are filled. 
| The ashes spill through snaking weed,
|   a year of life distilled. 
| 
| The overflows, Ambrosia wine,
|   Elysian cups of dust,
| from Earth unfroze the redesign
|   of missions more robust.
|
| The angel beaks of birds baptize
|   the dirt in streaking aisle.
| The cycle arcs in sharp reprise:
|   the ballad of the isle.

Landscapes
----------

| Oh, hapless world, the butcher's block,
|   The sickle, scythe, harpoon,
| The barren fields, the culled livestock,
|   The blood red harvest moon.
|
| The ocean deep, a darkened heart,
|   A sore that festers cold,
| A slumbered age, a violent art,
|   Into all things behold:
|
| The forests wild, the stalking hunt,
|   The arrow cut from stone,
| The bloody rib, the final grunt,
|   A death in whimpered groan.
|
| The mountain peaks, a falling height,
|   The air in sky dissolved,
| A winter wind, a bitter blight,
|   Let no sin be absolved.
|
| The city streets, the graveyard paths,
|   The linen beds of wards,
| The gowns of white, the final baths,
|   The oak in coffin boards.

Father's Lullaby
----------------

| Dear child, the monsters under bed
|   Are not just make believe.
| They lurk in shadows overhead
|   And offer no reprieve.
|
| Dear sweetling, sleep with open eye
|   And guard your dreams at night.
| Ignore your mother's lullaby,
|   Keep candles burning bright.
|
| Beware the lair that closets hide,
|   The racks of their disguise,
| The suits and ties, the cuffs that slide
|   And cloak them from your eyes.
|
| Fear not the slash of sharpened claws,
|   The flashing terror brief,
| But stamps that mark the written clause
|   With laws of fierce belief.
|
| What evil deeds those stories tell
|   Prepare your heart to meet
| The formal world where heroes fell
|   To wander incomplete.

Ode to the Heron
----------------

| Grey Heron, sing the song the winds will bring.
| Who lingers longer than the Winter king?  
|
| When hunting ground returns
|       Through fronts of blue to ice,
| The moles in burrowed urns
|       Prepare beside the mice
| As grunting geese will veer
|       Where churning warmth is drove,
| The deer all disappear
|       Through dreary dreaming cove.
|
| All yield, retreat and leave their claims till Spring.
| Through fields, what muffled name on streams will ring?
|
| The answer sweeps from east--
|       Oh! Heron! Hunter Grey! 
| Cry! Rouse the sleeping beast
|       And reaping, feast on prey!
| Creep low on drift of snow
|       With coiled neck of spear;
| Let steam of gasping slow
|       Their rasping scream of fear.
|
| The weather warms, yet Winter lifts your wing.
| The feathers swarm, but lone to cold you cling.
|
| In flocking song most birds
|       Find mate to take to nest;
| Let chorus part the herds
|       With fire from thumping chest,
| Your pumping flame that spurns
|       The burning cold on flank.
| Your silent stare discerns
|       The creatures left on bank.
|
| Each season makes of life a shape to wring.
| Each reason born in strife escapes to sing. 
|
| The Spring first strings the thread
|       Of lazy chirping thrush,
| The Summer, berry red
|       And cracking eggs in brush,
| Then Autumn crows of black
|       In pecking pumpkin hay.
| Only a lonely lack
|       Breeds mighty Heron Grey.
|
| When night descends, take stock of everything.
| What hidden home should find you nuzzling?
|
| What branches bear your weight?
|       Whose feathers stroke your beak?
| No human eyes await
|       The colony's mystique. 
| The shrieking calls coalesce
|       Atop the forest heights,
| In alien address
|       The flame inside ignites.

Elemental Elegy
---------------

| The day I sat by death's grey bed,
| I told a story green and true
| Of city bricks stacked proud and red,
| Of silver paths the stars imbue
| With golden hue we might have tread,
| Your slowing breath as cold as blue.
|
| I spoke the words to yellow skin
| And told of days in white to come.
| Your mouth, with specks of purple grin,
| And fingers stretched so pale and numb,
| My name, you said, so clear, so thin--
| With final grasp, in black succumb.
|
| Oh--Father, Father--brass horns blare!
| You string your harp with diamond thread
| And leave in me this slate despair!
| What crystal tears in eyes now shed?
| What pearl is formed by sightless stare?
| What platinum found in prayers pled?
|
| The oak around your body wraps
| As shoots of pine through spine are grown.
| In loam the roots will bind your scraps
| Despite the flowers laid on stone.
| Each time I come a stem I snap,
| For only Earth deserves your bone.

The Pantoums of Dementia
------------------------

| Movement I - Undulation
|
| the seconds slowed to stop as Father passed,
| when flocking sons returned to home to mourn,
| then Mother's mind began to crack at last  
| as moments shed in threads she once had worn. 
| 
| when flocking sons returned to home to mourn, 
| recast in lensing rays of age amassed 
| as moments shed in threads she once had worn
| the Father's sons adorned with clothes outcast. 
|
| recast in lensing rays of age amassed 
| a question, Mother, may I have a dance? 
| the Father's sons adorned with clothes outcast
| an offered hand through loops of time's expanse.
| 
| a question, Mother, may I have a dance? 
| their Father knelt and tender took her hand,
| an offered hand through loops of time's expanse,
| their final words in wilting hearts expand.
|
| their Father knelt and tender took her hand,
| the seconds slowed to stop as Father passed,
| their final words in wilting hearts expand, 
| then Mother's mind began to crack at last. 
|
| Movement II - Rearrangement
|
| remember now before the future fades, 
| the sutured minutes of memories held,
| records replayed as grooving sound degrades,
| advancing echoes, music notes dispelled. 
| 
| the sutured minutes of memories held:
| now twirling dance, oh younger selves, entrance
| advancing echoes, music notes dispelled
| through silent waltz that swells with last romance. 
|
| now twirling dance, oh younger selves, in trance
| with candled spells of woven hands that grasp
| through silent waltz that swells with last romance
| of eyes reshaping molds, the fated clasp. 
| 
| with candled spells of woven hands that grasp
| relapsing moments sung by bells and crowds
| of eyes, reshaping molds the fated clasp 
| of past refrains now sealed beneath the clouds. 
|
| relapsing moments sung by bells and crowds
| concealed by crumbling walls, demented shades
| of past refrains now sealed beneath these clouds
| that clutter skies in swarms that stretch decades.
|
| concealed by crumbling walls, demented shades
| (remember now before the future fades)
| invade the hollowed mind as scream pervades
| records replayed as grooving sound degrades.
|
| Movement III - Dissolution
|
| remember ancillary note sentries:
| the good can decay many ways.
| phantom morrow's cough. in times realize
| the mention there of tenant seasons.
|
| the good candy came anyways;
| all target the damaged mind in trance,
| (the men shun their often antsy sons)
| the flow ingrained decomposes.
|
| altar, get the damn aged mind, entrance
| memory erstwhile, foe kissing;
| the flowing rain eddy composes
| another ushered 
|
| memo rehearsed while focusing
| an aim, wintry slight, upward ingrown
| an other us heard 
| the fading names of suns.
|
| a name when trees light up, warding grown
| remembrance, ill airy notes in trees,
| the fading names of sons
| fan tomorrow's coffin, time's real eyes.

River Rats
----------

| On river shore the poor in tents will store
|    their nightly weeping sore.
| Above and north, the city steeples meet
| To speak in sermons ever incomplete
|     for sheep they so ignore.
|
| They fight with roar, yet beaten, kiss through gore;
| Their barrel fire northward dreams of more,
| The city lights too far a source of heat
|    For life on river shore.
|
| In winter months they paint on skin a whore,
| And every one despite what silence swore.
|     These cycles now repeat
|     While steeples chime upbeat.
| A yearly war for land they all abhor:
|     Their home on river shore.

Roundels of Remembrance
-----------------------

| I - Photographs
|
| This photograph of strangers' joy,
| In garbage can, though torn in half,
| Its glossy eyes through time enjoy 
|   this photograph. 
|
| Imagine tears that joyous laugh,
| The Autumn gowns and corduroy,
| A wedding banquet monograph.
|
| With age then mixed precise alloy
| From parts romance and epitaph,
| Til future hands at last destroy
|   This photograph.
|
| II - Walls

| Graffitied walls of yearly bloom,
| With vagrant spray of aerosols
| The vapors fume, condense to groom
|   graffitied walls. 
|
| The artists follow protocols:
| the lover's name, the prophet's doom,
| the epigraphs of homeless sprawls.
|
| The rarer buds of sweet perfume
| Are hidden deep in alley malls
| Where flowered faces sprung consume
|   graffitied walls. 
|
| III - Laces
|
| The laces sewn across the back
| Will lacerate through depths to bone.
| The body scars along the track
|   The laces sewn. 
|
| Despite the ache, the blanket grown 
| From knit of severed fiber slack
| Is warm enough to wrap alone.
|
| Yet laces loop, return to tack,
| As generations forced atone
| And learn by hand which loom to rack
|   the laces sewn. 
|
| IV - Air
| 
| The fragrant air which wavers here
| in heat like harps of golden hair
| that sweep their shoulder length to clear
|   the fragrant air.
|
| The lily sermons whisper where
| I heard your blood through skin by ear,
| A moment made in silent stare. 
|
| The scent remains, you disappear,
| as wind now speaks your name in prayer,
| in razor gusts that whip and shear
|   the fragrant air.
| 
| V - Ink
| 
| In fading ink, her fine details
| like curly cues and shades of pink,
| the shadowed lines that leak through trails
|   in fading ink.
|
| A paper mind she wrote to think, 
| so words replace what breath inhales
| and find my thoughts with hers in sync. 
|
| In letters light as chapel veils,
| I watch our dance as bodies sink,
| a final gasp of life exhales 
|   in fading ink.
|
| VI - Seats
|
| The vinyl seats of classic cars,
| the plastic smell their thread secretes,
| this cherry burn on cover mars 
|   the vinyl seats.
|
| When Father stooped to sew the sheets,
| his needles stacked in columned jars,
| his fingers folded rows of pleats.
|
| My fingers trace the wells of scars
| as driving down the city streets
| the last remain in leaving chars
|   the vinyl seats.

Song for the Demented
---------------------

| The lucky few who taste the hemlock blue!
| What fortune swings by neck from noose and nail!
| A minute gone their lives are bid adieu,
| Thus spared the withered touch that ages frail.
|
| For choicer cuts, then Time will stalk the mind
| In steady-stepping slow-revealed deceit,
| As hunters know to never scare the find,
| Unless the marbled fright infect the meat. 
|
| The body strung, then drained through veins of thought,
| precisely sliced at joints, the self is sluiced,
| its dripping threads, the wave of burning hot
| reserves of life, in air to steam reduced.
|
| Resolving boundaries release their hold,
| The crease of memories dissolve in fold.

The Cumberland Sonnet
---------------------

| Bay silt in city stone through time accrues
| along the western course of concrete flow
| that sweeps from plain to sky in upward spews
| as grey-white spray arcs over wave to snow
| from heights on high and splash on mountain spine
| where valleyed pools in rising drink their fill
| and shoot with sprouts through shoulders made of pine
| the roofs that empty crowds on streets and spill
| through hand to hand the layers stacked from base
| to wedded brick til building lillies bred
| against the westward wall in flood's embrace
| where lips at last are wet in watershed;
|
| Let skyline mark where tide in climb was broke:
| The steepled roof, the needled pine through oak.

ό ποιητα, ἢ πῖθι ἢ ἄπιθι
------------------------

| I
|
| Awake, Philosopher, rise from these words:
| Unwind in this future the tangle of time,
| Pitched behind pupils which shelter your mind,
| A dead language spoken and once lovely sung;
| What was yours only now graces all tongues.
|
| Burrow into my heart, unearth its mantle.
| Tally its hours, each stroke lights a candle;
| Number its sorrows as sureties to borrow,
| Spare not my marrow, fallow and frail.
| Whose spirit is this, twisting here twung?
| Breathe in this fire with thy mortal lung.
|
| Circle your sigils with salted symbols loan'd,
| And circles will square in this iron-red bone;
| A dream kiss that lingers in copper and crimson,
| A dream dew that swells under circling suns,
| A bud without season, never planted yet grown,
| In the sprout sprung, all things can be shown.
|
| All centers are fire, all orbits are ice,
| All points meet their center with marks imprecise
| The world is spoked in words of the spoken,
| Each whisper a lie of threaded truth unbroken,
| Met here now in this slipping handful of tokens
| Paid for the price of this thrice-worlded poem.
|
| II
|
| Forgive, Father, the blood of these swords:
| Unbind in this suture the end of all lines,
| Stitched in this present the essence divine,
| Take what is dull and bless it with sharp;
| Plunge this devotion into the ocean of hearts.
|
| Shovel the grave, pack it down with wet earth,
| All things tend towards the lack and the dearth;
| Slumber in barrows the marrows of kings,
| Spared not the gavel, hallow and hail.
| Whose mind is this, thinking these thoughts?
| Sleep in the mire which thy heart has wrought.
|
| Birthed in this house, scrubbed down in raw lye,
| So these tears may trace the dead with the die,
| The dead kiss with fingers of copper to scry
| The dead lists that swell in the crimson of lives,
| An end without reason, never sought yet found,
| In the shot sung, all arcs meet the ground.
|
| No fires have ice, no winters can flame,
| Son followed father, their center now framed,
| The world is found in the tears that remind him,
| Each moment a painting, a song or a hymn,
| Met there then in the words etched in stone
| Found then what lacks in the blackening moan.
|
| III
|
| Balance, Lover, these contraries of yours:
| Shine in these eyes the ruptures of life,
| Witched into worlds upon the blade of a knife;
| All wagers distill down to one move unproven,
| To find you again in this web-woven movement.
|
| Dance in the night, when the music is sundered,
| Count not the stars that belong to the numbers.
| We find in this time the rhymes of our kind,
| Spared not the sickle, those sickly or hale.
| Whose voice is this, singing these songs?
| Laugh with the liar whose heart sings along.
|
| Uncross your words of their fire-forged knots,
| And each will unlatch the thatches of thought:
| The dread kiss that coppers balance with nought,
| The dread song that cradles the crimson in crofts,
| A vow without treason, never spoken yet shown,
| By words of wordless wonder, such things can be grown.
|
| All fires are embers, all ashes are white,
| To find is to lose the center in flight,
| The world found in threads that bind always thus,
| Each fiber of moment knotted deftly in truss,
| Take hand and guide as though only you and I trust,
| Do what we will to balance world's thrust.

Kingdoms
--------

| Two children crossed an earthen bridge
| From level lawns to forests wild
| Along the rivered arc descending ridge.
| With dirty hands, they sang and smiled.
| Their charted map from zippered packs
| Now in branches espied its target
| As clearing yields to lily blacks
| Their kingdom's fresh air market.
| Lord and lady honorary, cheeked blush,
| Sat upon thrones of woven grass,
| Coronated by chirping choir thrush;
| A falling grain in hourglass. 
|
| On a maiden morning moments hence,
| They meet again upon the autumn passing,
| Where from heart's removed pretense
| On tender lips, farewell's final massing.
| Lily lyrics whisper sing from ground
| Reminders of their childish notions;
| World departed, their lives are found
| Separate by spanning roads and oceans.
|
| In the city, their trains diverge,
| Through tunnels tracked by wagered hours;
| Iron rails through hearts do purge
| Their aged minds of lily flowers.
| Winter drifts over concrete streets,
| In the thrush's snow sad song
| Delivered them in voice downbeat
| The final dirge of life prolonged.
| In the cold, their dream dissolved
| With the clock's incessant ticking
| Falling strokes of time resolved,
| They follow home a casket's wicking,
| Returned again to a lily covered field
| Where once royals played for a day;
| With new hearts scored and peeled
| In the funerary cloud of gray,
| In the clearing, coffins buried,
| Their eyes met in solitary gaze.
|
| In dirt developed their earthen walls,
| Roofed the sky to room above,
| Where lord and lady clothed in shawls
| Sing the thrushs' songed love.

The Paronymous Polyptotons of Love
----------------------------------

| "πτερωτὸν τῷ πτερῷ πτερωτὸν ῥηθήσεται."
|    - `Categories`_, 7.15, Aristotle
|
| I am an am that was an is,
|   a life those lives through living live,
| The song that sang what singers sung
|   When strings from stringed lutes were strung,
| Where cloven clefts with leaves of clove
|   The weft of weave with warp so wove.
|
| On evening eve, the eave of eyes,
|   From rows of rose, began to rise,
| There seeing seized to see the sight
|   that lit up lightened like a light:
| She shined in sheen and shining shone
|   In binding bound beneath my bone.
|
| At last her lashes lashed to mine,
|   a tale, though old, retold in time,
| What sooth to say through spoken sound
|   but growths of green from growing ground?
| In fleeing flight we fled in flood
|   and bled so bleeding blends our blood.
|
| The rote of rite has written soul
|   That hides in hole the hidden whole.
| We wound our wounds for winds unwind
|   To find defined a finer find.
| We are an are that was a were
|  That whirled a world to whirl with her.

Bird 
----

| To say what's meant without the word,
| Oh poetry, relent wherein
| I yield to you all things deferred,
| In baptism, repent my sin.
|
| I found a bird, that sings so soft,
| Her song aloft in heart by choice.
| To field of hers I pass so oft
| To sit in grass and drink her voice.
|
| With chirping dive she plunged so deep
| And pierced the weary veil that hides
| The ghosts of dreams that haunt my sleep;
| She sang such hopeful lullabies.
|
| Oh bird, oh bird, with glee you sing,
| If you could know the depths of dark
| That shadows cast in offering,
| Would song still burst from breast in lark?

Photographs of Autumn
---------------------

| These photographs are brittle leaves
|    That fell from trees, that we once caught.
| I press them tender into sleeves
|    Of glass to halt the course of rot.
| Though kept well fed with water shed,
|    They wilt to brown as colors fade.
| No leaf can live beside the bed,
|    Without sunlight that makes the shade.
| Yet even still, though claimed by dust,
|    I keep them hung upon my wall,
| For memory you did entrust
|    Of walk with you through golden Fall.

Walls
-----

| the husk of walls that city shucks
| accumulates and concentrates
| around like rings in ancient trunks
| where measured age with circle gates
| the spiraled line amassed through time,
| deposits buried down substrates.
|
| at summit's crest, the joints are thick
| and licking tongues of moss ascend
| the darkened blocks from quarry hauled
| on buttressed back, in stone suspend
| the garden court where crowds took root
| and grew their plans of walls to tend.
|
| from center peak the wooden slats
| erect the map with tangled fence
| to trace a grid of patchwork yards,
| these charts of dreams in ground commence
| the flattened course of borough life
| where burgs and burbs did once condense.
|
| then moving out, the bricks of red
| in crooked rows descend to meet
| the lanes of carriage tracts now black
| and scorched with tar in shapes of street
| where crimson dust from crumbled walls
| in dancing twirls across concrete.
|
| next grey cement of molded squares
| in towers stacked to portal sky
| with wires fused and humming signs;
| they arc and rise, on edges vie
| the vines entwined in rushing growth
| to split on spine, like nuclei.
|
| at last the stable struts of steel
| designed as straight as rays of light
| reflected back on silver glass
| the lattice links both left and right;
| the history in circled sweep
| constricts the city sphere so tight.
|
| through sections cross the avenue
| from point to point and time to time
| the human shell that forms in turn
| the arches bend, the steepled chime,
| that wilts and sheds, but fossils kept
| in barrows born their salt and lime.

Turkey Vultures
---------------

| the wakes of Turkey Vultures soar
| then perch across the steepled sky.
| they rest on totems tall and pure,
| in silence feathers multiply.
| their talons clutch where crosses meet
| the stolen spear of destined make.
| no heaven sent their wings of fleet,
| no stomach filled will hunger slake.
| the shapes of black in swarming plunged
| upon the carcass freshly brought.
| they feast on sins from gods expunged,
| but left for them as afterthought.
| bewitched to death, returned to Earth,
| from cage released, the specters hunt
| the ones who wear the curse of birth,
| they all must bear the brutal brunt.

The Law of Duality
------------------

| The world we lived that I once knew
|     (If one could know these fevered dreams)
| I've tried my hand unsticking glue 
|     (These fingers stick to broken seams)
| It sticks to me and sticks to you
|     (Like noose and neck that swing from beams)
| 
| To every thought a thought before
|     (To make of me a puppet string)
| And every point contains much more
|     (But only hollow things can ring)
| While every center holds a core
|     (Yet even empty space can sing)
|
| A million words and more to come
|     (I'd weep to know a single fact)
| These humming beats through syntax thrum
|     (Where waves reflect their heights subtract)
| In hopes a word will angle plumb
|     (Refracted rays in lines contract)
|
| This image pressed through sieve to mold
|     (The words I speak are cracked by heat)
| These holes that craft the shapes to hold
|     (No shapeless things are written neat)
| The world retold in paper fold
|     (What's left of life in crumpled sheet?)

Generations of Gravity
----------------------

| The mind, it breaks, and falls to parts.
| As father died, he spoke in tongues
| Of shifting walls and gravity
| That sideways pulled the world to parts. 
|
| The mind, it shakes, and all departs.
| As mother lost her lonely thoughts
| She spoke to walls, soliloquy
| That inward rolled as world departs.
|
| The mind, it fakes, and poisons hearts.
| As nightshade petals float to floors
| By walls that seep humanity,
| That crumble worlds of poisoned hearts. 
| 
| The mind, it wakes, in fits and starts.
| As thoughts now lay me down to sleep
| The walls will shift and speak to me
| That upside down my ending starts.

Holly Tree
----------

| Under the holly tree
| bough of berries,
| a siren red
| temptation.
|
| Where life began
| on skinny knees
| retching out 
| my guts.
|
| Waxy saw-tooth skin, 
| prickly leaves, 
| the sickly buds 
| of poison seeds.
|
| The tangy tongue
| of Christmas
| funerary rites.
| 
| I spewed
| through chrysalis,
| entrails slick 
| with acid grease,
| thickly dripping
| afterbirth.
|
| Gazed upon by 
| ageless tree,
| received in holy 
| communion, my first 
| memory:
| 
| The pluming rack
| of tight blue
| veins
| that hung about
| my neck.
|
| The womb of black
| that forked
| the branching
| Earth.
|
| The world that hid
| in bitter leaves
| and pushed me
| into it. 
|
| I made a wreath 
| of holly limbs
| to prick my head
| with thoughts. 
|
| I keep its berries
| bright as death
| and touch the skin
| that baptized
| me.

Depths
------

| The delicate kiss
| of stillness
| on fingertips.
|
| I linger
| on the precipice
| of surface 
| tension.
| 
| Pallid brine
| eagerly lapping 
| with organic clarity.
|

| plunge.
|

| beginnings.

Burning Bush
------------

| the pressure thrum of altitudes,
| the drumming beat in ears.
|
| as weary flesh ascends the face
| to summit hidden groves.
|
| where feathertips unseen but heard
| sigh through fluttered leaves.
|
| i sit cross-legged, cliffside hung
| above the place where strangers roam.
| 
| it's tiny, grey, and so 
| contained
| in concrete joints of streets.
|
| like bones that cage a 
| flame
| and hold it deep in valley ribs. 
|
| each measured 
| breath of mountain light
| lacks the air a city breathes. 
|
| it leaves me like a smoking wick
| that curls in syrupy sun.
| 
| extinguished and exhaled
| in secret sacrifice;
| the wage of god is 
| fire.

Cathedral
---------

| A church atop a steepled hill,
| Foundation layers ages old,
| Remains in spirit standing still.
| 
| The shattered stains on window sill,
| With marble halls of lichen mold,
| A church atop a steepled hill.
|
| Decrepit pews of souls fulfill
| What congregation left untold,
| Remains in spirit standing still.
|
| The circled streets possess no will
| Except the signs that staked and sold
| A church atop a steepled hill.
|
| But tower high such pointed skill,
| Through silken skies of glittered gold,
| Remains in spirit standing still.
|
| Ignore the wind, the biting chill,
| And cast your final gaze, behold:
| A church atop a steepled hill 
| Remains in spirit standing still.

Plots
-----

| In time their plot was touched by dark.
| Began the page this meadow scene
| where blades of grass were tall and stark.
|
| A tired arc, they met in park
| To kiss beneath the twilight queen;
| In time their plot was touched by dark.
|
| They stole away on sudden lark,
| Exchanged the words from whispered lean
| Where blades of grass were tall and stark.
|
| So happy now, neighbors remark,
| Yet seem is such to lose its sheen,
| In time their plot was touched by dark.
|
| Yet faded years ignored their spark
| In life they lived forever seen
| Where blades of grass were tall and stark.
|
| In ground, their bodies disembark
| And leave behind a hole dug clean.
| In time their plot was touched by dark,
| Where blades of grass were tall and stark.
