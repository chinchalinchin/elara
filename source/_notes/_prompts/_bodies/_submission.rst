.. # SOLICITATION: THE AFTERSHOCK REVIEW
.. 
.. The Aftershock Review is a poetry magazine committed to showcasing exceptional work that grapples with trauma in its many forms. But this isn’t about catharsis—it’s about great poetry. We believe that poems about trauma don’t have to be traumatic. They can be nuanced, tender, sharp, or even playful. Above all, they should push the boundaries of language and form, showing us what poetry can do.
.. 
.. Our mission is to become a leading publication for poetry that examines the aftershocks of lived experience with precision, imagination, and artistic integrity. We look for work that challenges the narrative of trauma as simply pain and explores it as a complex force that shapes, complicates, and enriches human life.
..
.. We believe that poetry has the power to transform how we see the world—and ourselves.
..
.. "After almost dying, there was only one option in front of me: to survive. But not just that, to thrive. This is a celebration of that. This is my manifesto for living. With over 40 confirmed names, our lineup is wildly inclusive and diverse, featuring individuals aged 17 to 93. It includes multinational poets, as well as those who are disabled, neurodiverse, LGBTQ+, and represent all income strata.
.. 
.. We also have BIPOC voices, voices from those who have lived with psychosis, and people who have been affected by terminal illnesses in their lives as well as those with other hidden disabilities among our contributors.
.. 
.. I believe these are voices that need to be heard.
.. 
.. Their poetry is proof of that."
.. 
.. – Max Wallis

..

.. 
.. – Pascale Petit
.. 
.. The Aftershock Review is a new poetry magazine committed to showcasing exceptional work that grapples with the aftershocks of trauma in its many forms. But this isn’t just catharsis—it’s about great poetry. We believe that poems about trauma don’t have to be traumatic. Poems about new love, new want, new desire are here too. Humans are humany, and all that comes with it. Poetry about trauma can be nuanced, tender, sharp, or even playful. Above all, they should push the boundaries of language and form, showing us what poetry can do. And they can be BRILLIANT.
..
.. You are supporting our mission to be a leading publication for poetry that examines the aftershocks of lived experience with precision, imagination, and artistic integrity. We look for work that challenges the narrative of trauma as simply pain and explores it as a complex force that shapes, complicates, and enriches human life.
.. 
.. Poetry has the power to transform how we see the world—and ourselves. Monies raised - in conjunction with an Arts Council bid - will fund the first issue of the magazine as well as subsequent issues and a pamphlet series.

Poems

Elemental Elegy
------------------

| The day I sat by death's grey bed,
| I told a story green and true
| Of city bricks stacked proud and red,
| Of silver paths the stars imbue
| With golden hue we might have tread,
| Your slowing breath as cold as blue.
|
| I spoke the words to yellow skin
| And told of days in white to come.
| Your mouth, with specks of purple grin,
| And fingers stretched so pale and numb,
| My name, you said, so clear, so thin--
| With final grasp, in black succumb.
|
| Oh--Father, Father--brass horns blare!
| You string your harp with diamond thread
| And leave in me this slate despair!
| What crystal tears in eyes now shed?
| What pearl is formed by sightless stare?
| What platinum found in prayers pled?
|
| The oak around your body wraps
| As shoots of pine through spine are grown.
| In loam the roots will bind your scraps
| Despite the flowers laid on stone.
| Each time I come a stem I snap,
| For only Earth deserves your bone.

Song for the Demented
---------------------

| The lucky few who taste the hemlock blue!
| What fortune swings by neck from noose and nail!
| A minute gone their lives are bid adieu,
| Thus spared the withered touch that ages frail.
|
| For choicer cuts, then Time will stalk the mind
| In steady-stepping slow-revealed deceit,
| As hunters know to never scare the find,
| Unless the marbled fright infect the meat. 
|
| The body strung, then drained through veins of thought,
| precisely sliced at joints, the self is sluiced,
| its dripping threads, the wave of burning hot
| reserves of life, in air to steam reduced.
|
| Resolving boundaries release their hold,
| The crease of memories dissolve in fold.

The Pantoums of Dementia
------------------------

| Movement I - Undulation
|
| the seconds slowed to stop as Father passed,
| when flocking sons returned to home to mourn,
| then Mother's mind began to crack at last  
| as moments shed in threads she once had worn. 
| 
| when flocking sons returned to home to mourn, 
| recast in lensing rays of age amassed 
| as moments shed in threads she once had worn
| the Father's sons adorned with clothes outcast. 
|
| recast in lensing rays of age amassed 
| a question, Mother, may I have a dance? 
| the Father's sons adorned with clothes outcast
| an offered hand through loops of time's expanse.
| 
| a question, Mother, may I have a dance? 
| their Father knelt and tender took her hand,
| an offered hand through loops of time's expanse,
| their final words in wilting hearts expand.
|
| their Father knelt and tender took her hand,
| the seconds slowed to stop as Father passed,
| their final words in wilting hearts expand, 
| then Mother's mind began to crack at last. 
|
| Movement II - Rearrangement
|
| remember now before the future fades, 
| the sutured minutes of memories held,
| records replayed as grooving sound degrades,
| advancing echoes, music notes dispelled. 
| 
| the sutured minutes of memories held:
| now twirling dance, oh younger selves, entrance
| advancing echoes, music notes dispelled
| through silent waltz that swells with last romance. 
|
| now twirling dance, oh younger selves, in trance
| with candled spells of woven hands that grasp
| through silent waltz that swells with last romance
| of eyes reshaping molds, the fated clasp. 
| 
| with candled spells of woven hands that grasp
| relapsing moments sung by bells and crowds
| of eyes, reshaping molds the fated clasp 
| of past refrains now sealed beneath the clouds. 
|
| relapsing moments sung by bells and crowds
| concealed by crumbling walls, demented shades
| of past refrains now sealed beneath these clouds
| that clutter skies in swarms that stretch decades.
|
| concealed by crumbling walls, demented shades
| (remember now before the future fades)
| invade the hollowed mind as scream pervades
| records replayed as grooving sound degrades.
|
| Movement III - Dissolution
|
| remember ancillary note sentries:
| the good can decay many ways.
| phantom morrow's cough. in times realize
| the mention there of tenant seasons.
|
| the good candy came anyways;
| all target the damaged mind in trance,
| (the men shun their often antsy sons)
| the flow ingrained decomposes.
|
| altar, get the damn aged mind, entrance
| memory erstwhile, foe kissing;
| the flowing rain eddy composes
| another ushered 
|
| memo rehearsed while focusing
| an aim, wintry slight, upward ingrown
| an other us heard 
| the fading names of suns.
|
| a name when trees light up, warding grown
| remembrance, ill airy notes in trees,
| the fading names of sons
| fan tomorrow's coffin, time's real eyes.
