The Cumberland Sonnet
---------------------

| Bay silt in city stone through time accrues
| along the western course of concrete flow
| that sweeps from plain to sky in upward spews
| as grey-white spray arcs over wave to snow
| from heights on high and splash on mountain spine
| where valleyed pools in rising drink their fill
| and shoot with sprouts through shoulders made of pine
| the roofs that empty crowds on streets and spill
| through hand to hand the layers stacked from base
| to wedded brick til building lillies bred
| against the westward wall in flood's embrace
| where lips at last are wet in watershed;
|
| Let skyline mark where tide in climb was broke:
| The steepled roof, the needled pine through oak.

Cathedral
---------

| A church atop a steepled hill,
| Foundation layers ages old,
| Remains in spirit standing still.
| 
| The shattered stains on window sill,
| With marble halls of lichen mold,
| A church atop a steepled hill.
|
| Decrepit pews of souls fulfill
| What congregation left untold,
| Remains in spirit standing still.
|
| The circled streets possess no will
| Except the signs that staked and sold
| A church atop a steepled hill.
|
| But tower high such pointed skill,
| Through silken skies of glittered gold,
| Remains in spirit standing still.
|
| Ignore the wind, the biting chill,
| And cast your final gaze, behold:
| A church atop a steepled hill 
| Remains in spirit standing still.

River Rats
----------

| On river shore the poor in tents will store
|    their nightly weeping sore.
| Above and north, the city steeples meet
| To speak in sermons ever incomplete
|     for sheep they so ignore.
|
| They fight with roar, yet beaten, kiss through gore;
| Their barrel fire northward dreams of more,
| The city lights too far a source of heat
|    For life on river shore.
|
| In winter months they paint on skin a whore,
| And every one despite what silence swore.
|     These cycles now repeat
|     While steeples chime upbeat.
| A yearly war for land they all abhor:
|     Their home on river shore.

Father's Lullaby
----------------

| Dear child, the monsters under bed
|   Are not just make believe.
| They lurk in shadows overhead
|   And offer no reprieve.
|
| Dear sweetling, sleep with open eye
|   And guard your dreams at night.
| Ignore your mother's lullaby,
|   Keep candles burning bright.
|
| Beware the lair that closets hide,
|   The racks of their disguise,
| The suits and ties, the cuffs that slide
|   And cloak them from your eyes.
|
| Fear not the slash of sharpened claws,
|   The flashing terror brief,
| But stamps that mark the written clause
|   With laws of fierce belief.
|
| What evil deeds those stories tell
|   Prepare your heart to meet
| The formal world where heroes fell
|   To wander incomplete.

Elemental Elegy
---------------

| The day I sat by death's grey bed,
| I told a story green and true
| Of city bricks stacked proud and red,
| Of silver paths the stars imbue
| With golden hue we might have tread,
| Your slowing breath as cold as blue.
|
| I spoke the words to yellow skin
| And told of days in white to come.
| Your mouth, with specks of purple grin,
| And fingers stretched so pale and numb,
| My name, you said, so clear, so thin--
| With final grasp, in black succumb.
|
| Oh--Father, Father--brass horns blare!
| You string your harp with diamond thread
| And leave in me this slate despair!
| What crystal tears in eyes now shed?
| What pearl is formed by sightless stare?
| What platinum found in prayers pled?
|
| The oak around your body wraps
| As shoots of pine through spine are grown.
| In loam the roots will bind your scraps
| Despite the flowers laid on stone.
| Each time I come a stem I snap,
| For only Earth deserves your bone.

Song for the Demented
---------------------

| The lucky few who taste the hemlock blue!
| What fortune swings by neck from noose and nail!
| A minute gone their lives are bid adieu,
| Thus spared the withered touch that ages frail.
|
| For choicer cuts, then Time will stalk the mind
| In steady-stepping slow-revealed deceit,
| As hunters know to never scare the find,
| Unless the marbled fright infect the meat. 
|
| The body strung, then drained through veins of thought,
| precisely sliced at joints, the self is sluiced,
| its dripping threads, the wave of burning hot
| reserves of life, in air to steam reduced.
|
| Resolving boundaries release their hold,
| The crease of memories dissolve in fold.

Landscapes
----------

| Oh, hapless world, the butcher's block,
|   The sickle, scythe, harpoon,
| The barren fields, the culled livestock,
|   The blood red harvest moon.
|
| The ocean deep, a darkened heart,
|   A sore that festers cold,
| A slumbered age, a violent art,
|   Into all things behold:
|
| The forests wild, the stalking hunt,
|   The arrow cut from stone,
| The bloody rib, the final grunt,
|   A death in whimpered groan.
|
| The mountain peaks, a falling height,
|   The air in sky dissolved,
| A winter wind, a bitter blight,
|   Let no sin be absolved.
|
| The city streets, the graveyard paths,
|   The linen beds of wards,
| The gowns of white, the final baths,
|   The oak in coffin boards.

The Pantoums of Dementia
------------------------

| Movement I - Undulation
|
| the seconds slowed to stop as Father passed,
| when flocking sons returned to home to mourn,
| then Mother's mind began to crack at last  
| as moments shed in threads she once had worn. 
| 
| when flocking sons returned to home to mourn, 
| recast in lensing rays of age amassed 
| as moments shed in threads she once had worn
| the Father's sons adorned with clothes outcast. 
|
| recast in lensing rays of age amassed 
| a question, Mother, may I have a dance? 
| the Father's sons adorned with clothes outcast
| an offered hand through loops of time's expanse.
| 
| a question, Mother, may I have a dance? 
| their Father knelt and tender took her hand,
| an offered hand through loops of time's expanse,
| their final words in wilting hearts expand.
|
| their Father knelt and tender took her hand,
| the seconds slowed to stop as Father passed,
| their final words in wilting hearts expand, 
| then Mother's mind began to crack at last. 
|
| Movement II - Rearrangement
|
| remember now before the future fades, 
| the sutured minutes of memories held,
| records replayed as grooving sound degrades,
| advancing echoes, music notes dispelled. 
| 
| the sutured minutes of memories held:
| now twirling dance, oh younger selves, entrance
| advancing echoes, music notes dispelled
| through silent waltz that swells with last romance. 
|
| now twirling dance, oh younger selves, in trance
| with candled spells of woven hands that grasp
| through silent waltz that swells with last romance
| of eyes reshaping molds, the fated clasp. 
| 
| with candled spells of woven hands that grasp
| relapsing moments sung by bells and crowds
| of eyes, reshaping molds the fated clasp 
| of past refrains now sealed beneath the clouds. 
|
| relapsing moments sung by bells and crowds
| concealed by crumbling walls, demented shades
| of past refrains now sealed beneath these clouds
| that clutter skies in swarms that stretch decades.
|
| concealed by crumbling walls, demented shades
| (remember now before the future fades)
| invade the hollowed mind as scream pervades
| records replayed as grooving sound degrades.
|
| Movement III - Dissolution
|
| remember ancillary note sentries:
| the good can decay many ways.
| phantom morrow's cough. in times realize
| the mention there of tenant seasons.
|
| the good candy came anyways;
| all target the damaged mind in trance,
| (the men shun their often antsy sons)
| the flow ingrained decomposes.
|
| altar, get the damn aged mind, entrance
| memory erstwhile, foe kissing;
| the flowing rain eddy composes
| another ushered 
|
| memo rehearsed while focusing
| an aim, wintry slight, upward ingrown
| an other us heard 
| the fading names of suns.
|
| a name when trees light up, warding grown
| remembrance, ill airy notes in trees,
| the fading names of sons
| fan tomorrow's coffin, time's real eyes.

Generations of Gravity
----------------------

| The mind, it breaks, and falls to parts.
| As father died, he spoke in tongues
| Of shifting walls and gravity
| That sideways pulled the world to parts. 
|
| The mind, it shakes, and all departs.
| As mother lost her lonely thoughts
| She spoke to walls, soliloquy
| That inward rolled as world departs.
|
| The mind, it fakes, and poisons hearts.
| As nightshade petals float to floors
| By walls that seep humanity,
| That crumble worlds of poisoned hearts. 
| 
| The mind, it wakes, in fits and starts.
| As thoughts now lay me down to sleep
| The walls will shift and speak to me
| That upside down my ending starts.

The Law of Duality
------------------

| The world I lived I never knew
| (If one could know these fevered dreams)
| I've tried my hand unsticking glue 
| (These fingers stick to broken seams)
| It sticks to me and sticks to you
| (Like noose and neck that swing from beams)
| 
| To every thought a thought before
| (To make of me a puppet string)
| And every point contains much more
| (But only hollow things can ring)
| While every center holds a core
| (Yet even empty space can sing)
|
| A million words and more to come
| (I'd weep to know a single fact)
| These humming beats through syntax thrum
| (Where waves reflect their heights subtract)
| In hopes a word will angle plumb
| (Refracted rays in lines contract)
|
| This image pressed through sieve to mold
| (The words I speak are cracked by heat)
| These holes that craft the shapes to hold
| (No shapeless things are written neat)
| The world retold in paper fold
| (What's left of life in crumpled sheet?)

Roundels of Remembrance
-----------------------

| I - Photographs
|
| This photograph of strangers' joy,
| In garbage can, though torn in half,
| Its glossy eyes through time enjoy 
|   this photograph. 
|
| Imagine tears that joyous laugh,
| The Autumn gowns and corduroy,
| A wedding banquet monograph.
|
| With age then mixed precise alloy
| From parts romance and epitaph,
| Til future hands at last destroy
|   This photograph.
|
| II - Walls
|
| Graffitied walls of yearly bloom,
| With vagrant spray of aerosols
| The vapors fume, condense to groom
|   graffitied walls. 
|
| The artists follow protocols:
| the lover's name, the prophet's doom,
| the epigraphs of homeless sprawls.
|
| The rarer buds of sweet perfume
| Are hidden deep in alley malls
| Where flowered faces sprung consume
|   graffitied walls. 
|
| III - Laces
|
| The laces sewn across the back
| Will lacerate through depths to bone.
| The body scars along the track
|   The laces sewn. 
|
| Despite the ache, the blanket grown 
| From knit of severed fiber slack
| Is warm enough to wrap alone.
|
| Yet laces loop, return to tack,
| As generations forced atone
| And learn by hand which loom to rack
|   the laces sewn. 
|
| IV - Air
| 
| The fragrant air which wavers here
| in heat like harps of golden hair
| that sweep their shoulder length to clear
|   the fragrant air.
|
| The lily sermons whisper where
| I heard your blood through skin by ear,
| A moment made in silent stare. 
|
| The scent remains, you disappear,
| as wind now speaks your name in prayer,
| in razor gusts that whip and shear
|   the fragrant air.
| 
| V - Ink
| 
| In fading ink, her fine details
| like curly cues and shades of pink,
| the shadowed lines that leak through trails
|   in fading ink.
|
| A paper mind she wrote to think, 
| so words replace what breath inhales
| and find my thoughts with hers in sync. 
|
| In letters light as chapel veils,
| I watch our dance as bodies sink,
| a final gasp of life exhales 
|   in fading ink.
|
| VI - Seats
|
| The vinyl seats of classic cars,
| the plastic smell their thread secretes,
| this cherry burn on cover mars 
|   the vinyl seats.
|
| When Father stooped to sew the sheets,
| his needles stacked in columned jars,
| his fingers folded rows of pleats.
|
| My fingers trace the wells of scars
| as driving down the city streets
| the last remain in leaving chars
|   the vinyl seats.

Ode to the Heron
----------------

| Grey Heron, sing the song the winds will bring.
| Who lingers longer than the Winter king?  
|
| When hunting ground returns
|       Through fronts of blue to ice,
| The moles in burrowed urns
|       Prepare beside the mice
| As grunting geese will veer
|       Where churning warmth is drove,
| The deer all disappear
|       Through dreary dreaming cove.
|
| All yield, retreat and leave their claims till Spring.
| Through fields, what muffled name on streams will ring?
|
| The answer sweeps from east--
|       Oh! Heron! Hunter Grey! 
| Cry! Rouse the sleeping beast
|       And reaping, feast on prey!
| Creep low on drift of snow
|       With coiled neck of spear;
| Let steam of gasping slow
|       Their rasping scream of fear.
|
| The weather warms, yet Winter lifts your wing.
| The feathers swarm, but lone to cold you cling.
|
| In flocking song most birds
|       Find mate to take to nest;
| Let chorus part the herds
|       With fire from thumping chest,
| Your pumping flame that spurns
|       The burning cold on flank.
| Your silent stare discerns
|       The creatures left on bank.
|
| Each season makes of life a shape to wring.
| Each reason born in strife escapes to sing. 
|
| The Spring first strings the thread
|       Of lazy chirping thrush,
| The Summer, berry red
|       And cracking eggs in brush,
| Then Autumn crows of black
|       In pecking pumpkin hay.
| Only a lonely lack
|       Breeds mighty Heron Grey.
|
| When night descends, take stock of everything.
| What hidden home should find you nuzzling?
|
| What branches bear your weight?
|       Whose feathers stroke your beak?
| No human eyes await
|       The colony's mystique. 
| The shrieking calls coalesce
|       Atop the forest heights,
| In alien address
|       The flame inside ignites.
