the Sunday mornings hang in clouds of smoke
above my head where thoughts of you reside
recalling times my clumsy fingers broke
some stitch or knot your fingers deftly tied,
or when you'd measure out your thread
    to fix the errors made
        and sew it back anew,
i realized, watching as you spread
    the fabric that i frayed,
        i never would be you.






you went and died and left these tools behind
as if one day i'd understand their aim,
instead they rust away in spots that shined 
when you were here to shoulder blame






instead they rust away where once they shined
