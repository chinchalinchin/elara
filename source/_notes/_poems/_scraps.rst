| Ainsley Dupree, it pains me to see
| Your talent spread thin over years

---

| in divey dive where diving dove. 

| from prior pries of prying prize. 

|   she said to say what saying says. 
| We worked the work that working wrought
|   to buy by buying by the bought.
| We shine in sheen what shining shone,
|   to bind what's bound in binding bone. 
| We die the deaths the dying died
|   To lay the lie where laying laid. 
| I is an am that is a were.
|   I whirled a world that whirling whirs. 

| The deaths the dying died before 
|   were laid to lie by lying score. 

---

| The lawyers around uptown courthouse lane,
| where apple plums through crooked fall in sync
| With paper charts that map legal terrain,
| while rotting cherries blossom into pink,


| In an honest world, no soul would be free. 
| Our minds convict us every waking second.

---

| So lily white, the petal crowds,
| Though dressed in mourning black as night,
| They stood beneath the morning clouds
|   so lily white. 
|
| As coffin lowered out of sight,
| The body wrapped in linen shrouds,
| The mind remained in final rite.

| Through words they spoke the last invite
| For fading friend the haze enshrouds
| 

| So lily white the petaled flock,
| Though dressed in mourning black as night,
| They gather round a face of chalk 
|   So lily white. 
|
| As coffin lowered out of sight,
| 

---

| The morning clouds

---

| my mausoleum is grown from the dirt,
| and the permanence of stone.
| here my tomb is erected,
| within a labyrinth.
|
| the architect's 
| insidious logic
| holds the columns 
| above the empty space
| where I reside.
| 
| these walls that mark
| the monument of me
| and my pharoah soul,
| though proportionate in volume,
| and similar in nature,
| fail to hold this thought:

---

| observe the birch and how it grows,
| the twisted course of skyward arc.
|
| its roots secrete a sap that flows
| and hardens into plates of bark.
| 
| in silent columns, the years accrue 
| the ashen hosts that span the field. 
| 
| 
|
| my blood ascends through webs of veins
| to reach my fingers catching sun.
| 
| its warmth is spread, but none remains
| when blood returns, its circuit done. 

---


| if only hearts could feel the heat
| their leaves receive on summer days. 
| 
| instead they spiral in retreat
| and branch their bodies like a maze.
|
| and in the blossoms bloom the shade,
| the hidden parts around the glade.

---

| the shape of leaves in gusts of wind
|
| the shape that leaves will make on wind
| will swarm behind your feet like thieves
| attend
| the shape that leaves.
|
| in tracing wind, 
| will swarm behind your feet like thieves
| 
| will sneak behind your feat like thieves
|
|    the shape that leaves
|
| let's make believe and play pretend

---

| cicada forests sing in evening swarms
| along the hidden trails of river banks 
| that skirt the city edge with thunderstorms

---

| everything is ending, nothing will come back. 

---

| the weeping floods 
| of mountain woods. 
| the sewer greets
| through metal grates. 

---

| my babel thoughts of floods foretold,
| the levels rising upside down. 
|
| the tides that rush from up above
| to chase me down again.
| 
| i reignite
| beneath the shadow
| heavens cast.

---

| the rapture thought 
| exactly made, contained 
| within what hallow breath and fire mix.
|  
| not to fade away
| but fade within
| to thinning wind,
| dissolved into the sky. 

---

| but idling, the fumes accrue,
| no longer burnt away,
| the nauseous thoughts 
| that churn in knots
| around my neck a cloud
| of  

---

| ceaseless tears 

---

| i've lived a hundred different lives in thought

---

| the moment of waking is often the hardest

---

| in parallax the trains and trees 
| retreat from me at different rates
|
| their axes cross in sharp degrees
| and balance out their counterweights
|
| the past remains, the future flees,
| and I through eyes recurse to death.

---

| upon a hill
| where highway arches intersect

---

| their axes cross
| an angled trio isoceles
| i'm kept between competing parentheses
| the intersection of realities

---

| crafty spiders spin their webs
| the threads of chance are razor thin
|
| the stream of gants in flows and ebbs

---

| everything returns to green until it doesn't anymore.

---

| my dear, you'll soon be dreaming.

---

| never trust the motives of a fancy haircut.

---

| you call me up to say it's gone
| the cushion stolen by some thief
| 
| one head
| 
| the notes you leave to ward off ghosts
| the dogs you feed with oven roasts
|
| at night the neighbors
| who is this person you're talking to?

---

| i thought you'd stay another day.

---

| every moment is inescapable
|
| reversed incisors chew my mind. 

---

| Terra Alta, West Virginia 
| Your roads are woven mountain side
|
| Rollercoaster roads
| a promenade the masons laids

---

| unfinished thoughts collect in stacks.

---

| the sea goes green while spinning round
| but winter calls it court to poles 

---

| you told me once we're make beleive.

---

| lonely goose upon the pond
| away from flock and friends
| you cluck and cluck so timidly
| lost alone without ending 
|
| circle round and breeze blown, swim

---

| contortionist geese in molting knots
| they tie into pretzels and pick at their feathers
| bending sideways down through corkscrews
| to reach around their stomach body
| the summer Icarus, the bound Prometheus in seasonal purgatory
| where father geese keep watchful eyes
| over upturned feet waggling at the sky
| as underwater beaks plow the floating forest
|
| the young, no longer gosling, bold enough to approach
| and then flee in waddling flight
| upon discovery of a larger world
| they molt in flooded canals,
| in the jointed archway of locks 
| where boats in ages past glued rivers 
|
| then navies descend from regions unknown
| in honking lines that splash like bombs
| battles of flapping and hissing,
| the upright warrior poses of geese
| held aloft just above the surface
| extending their necks like spears 
| the squadrons array and chaos descends 
|
| another wave drops from the sky, wave after wave, 
| until the geese litter the surface like a plague.
|
| and then dividing into their packs:
| a sestet, 
| a lovesmitten couplet. 

---

| my love, you're made of smoke and vapor mist.
| in dreams, we're dancing round again.
|
| my love, you're vapor, smoking mist. 

---

| crumble, crumble, world of man.

---

| the things we leave behind

---

| Oh, Mother dearest, you're quite insane. 

---

| A week from now, our love will fade,
| my name your tongue will disavow.
| no trace remains of games we played
| a week from now. 
|
| despite our fate, believe this vow: 
| these moments spent with you pervade 
| the ones to comes,

---

| the people leaves 
| with their branching lives.
| what does the tree desire?
| to grow with lazy ease. 
| to tumble rotten to the ground. 

---

| the lonely hours drain my mind.
| every moment remains the same;
| the days are long, the years are short.
| i wait to die with wetted lips.
|
| every moment remains the same;
| the kiss of life, its poision sweet, 
| i wait to die with wetted lips.

---

| A roach scurrying through cigarette ash.
| Alien limbs. 
| Garage door opening, an avalanche of light.
| At that moment, the thought:
| The divine walks among us,
| But we fail to comprehend entirely.
| There is no world beyond this one.
| And God is here.

---

| From the atoms, Adam.

---

| A picture of a picture. 

---

| At dusk when grass evaporates into droplets of fire. 

---

| Oh, Margaret, my dear,
| Will your questions never cease? 
| 
| The answers aren't clear.
| Don't be so rash, darling please. 
|
| Don't cry, sweet child.
| Oh, Margaret, my dear.
|
| Just lay here awhile
| These lives will disappear. 

---

| oh little flower,
| don't cry today.
|
| your wilting petals
| the rain will shower
| your tears away.
|
| though life will linger
| so brief, then gone
| the stars will twinkle
| for eons on.

---

| the satelittes 
| of steeple tips
| across the city sky
| each focus point
| of hymnals
| beamed to where
| i cannot say. 
|
| i cannot stay
| as sermons seep
| invisible
| in electric air. 
|
| the gospel speaks
| in moving waves
| that lap around
| me rippling.
|
| the way the world
| fractals outward
| through worlds of worlds
| within the human heart
| of silent air;
| it leaves me breathless
| gasping,
| bewildered eternally.
|
| the world inside the word, 
| the word inside the wave,
| the wave inside the world.
| the slithering skin
| of god. 

---

| the eye of god
| gazes deep
| on me
| in reverie.
|
| it brings the storm
| of crooked tears
| and lancing guilt.
|
| the pustules
| overflow

---

| the velvet skin of roses grown

---

| the forest chorus lines

---

| the silent rain is like a lashing flail.
| the silent rain in lines begins to flail
| the silent rain in puddles tells our tale.
| the silent rain begins to tell our tale.

---

| the grain of folds within your clenching fist
| reveal the tangled web that veins your hand.
|
| the grain  your palm are tangled thick
| the folds within your palm of tangled skein
| the 
| veins your hand. 
|
| Dispersed like ranging echoes from their source,
| across the world a storm contains your hand. 
| restrains your hand. 
|
| Dispersed like ranging echoes from their source,
| across the void a voice contains your hand. 
|
| not even restrains your hand. 
| despite  restrains your hand
| from panes, your hand.
| restrains your hand
| nothing done regains your hand.
|
| Please grant me this: a blameless moment more
| where touching me no longer stains your hand.
|
| Dispersed like ranging echoes from their source, 
| the ghost of music played ordains your hand. 
|
| Refrains that play their notes in keys of me, 
| the medley of that man profanes your hand.
|
| mundanely, evening serenades a hymn,
| the same that sang 
| in hopes its music entertains your hand.
|
| a tired 
| a song we sung 
| Your dream domain is strangely lacking me. 
| music trains your hand.
| and soon my hand no longer stains your hand. 
| tonight I'll soak with tears what stains your hand. 
|
| this grant you gave to hold 
| explains your hand?
|
| no matter what, your hand remains your hand.
|
| contains your hand
| entertains your hand.
| maintains your hand.
| obtains your hand. 
| regains your hand.
| retrains your hand.
| sprains your hand.
| stains your hand. 
| reins your hand.
| reigns your hand.
