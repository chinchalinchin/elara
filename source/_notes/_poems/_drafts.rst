The Age of Poetry
-----------------

| The age of poetry will destroy the world
| in a flash of fumbling beauty
| stanzas like atom bombs
| and rhymes like lines
| of soldiers keeping time
| to beating barrels 
| of the front line.  
| Art (like the mind)
| cannot comprehend its glory.

The Mid-Winter March
--------------------

| At twelve when I woke up, the ground was dry.
| Around one, it started snowing.
| By four, the roads were slush
| and the town was hushed.
| When I went to the liquor store at 7:12,
| the streets were filled like store shelves
| Waning silhouettes 
| limping like zombies
| towards the liquor store.
| The mid-winter march
| of alcoholism
| like the stalwart journey
| of the emperor penguins
| in the freezing wastelands
| of Antarctica.
| I go inside and
| get my fifth of vodka
| pack of cigarettes
| bag of peanuts
| and say my prayers
| at the counter of clerks.
|
| The sky
| falls to the ground
| in the muted silence of
| a winter's night.

The End
-------

| The pavement tide recedes
| and the brick and mortar beaches 
| expose the fault lines of the City. 
|
| This town will one day sink into the ground
| and Nature will reclaim its property. 
|
| We will pluck berries from vines 
| growing up the sides of office complexes
| and erect deerskin tents on the shattered blacktop.
|
| We will dance around bonfires,
| chanting songs sung to the soul of everything
| and tell stories about the formation of stars,
| the teardrops of goddesses frozen in the sky.
|
| The forest will whistle with wind
| and billboards will be painted over with the faces of totems,
| the ink distilled from the buds of flowers.

- 2009

Dreams 
------

| I dream of waves and tides
| of slippery skin and sand
| seashells like the shingles
| of some great underground structure
| whose columns support the ground
| and whose foundation holds tight 
| the heart of the Earth.
| 
| In my sleep, I wake
| from my sleep
| from the long thought
| thought by tall people
| thinking short thoughts.
| I stretch my muscles
| and crack my neck,
| touch my toes
| and run into the water.

Truth
-----

| Some things are beautiful.
| Some things are not.
| 
| Some people are crazy.
| And the others are too.
| 
| I lost my mind a while ago, myself. 
| Now I talk to myself.
| Write notes to myself.
| Here are few:
| 
| I'm lonely.
| 
| You're dying.
| 
| There's nothing left.
| 
| I'm obsessed with things
| that I'm not very good at.
| 
| I fail and I fail. 
| I never learn.
| 
| The bums know the truth.
| The cold and the bench.

Mimic
-----

| Mimic, dear mate, pray hesitate!
| Tread not upon this course!
| What follows sweet is heart's remorse!
|
| Those lines afar you judged so straight
| Are crooked yet and coarse.
| Mimic, dear mate, pray hesitate!
|
| You'll gain a head in broad divorce,
| But find astride your gait
| What follows sweet is heart's remorse.
|
| What lists like light will soon find weight
| If drawn from me my source.
| Mimic, dear mate, pray hesitate!
|
| This curse of mine for you awaits
| if you persist, perforce;
| What follows sweet is heart's remorse.
|
| In throat my voice your lungs will break
| To find a song so hoarse.
| Mimic, dear mate, pray hesitate!
| What follows sweet is heart's remorse.

Kingdoms
--------

| Two children crossed an earthen bridge
| from level lawns to forests wild
| along the rivered arc descending ridge.
| With dirty hands, they sang and smiled.
| their charted map from zippered packs
| now in branches espied its target
| as clearing yields to lily blacks
| their kingdom's fresh air market.
| Lord and lady honorary, cheeked blush,
| sat upon thrones of woven grass,
| coronated by chirping choir thrush;
| a falling grain in hourglass. 
|
| On a maiden morning moments hence,
| they meet again upon the autumn passing,
| where from heart's removed pretense
| on tender lips, farewell's final massing.
| Lily lyrics whisper sing from ground
| reminders of their childish notions;
| World departed, their lives are found
| separate by spanning roads and oceans.
|
| In the city, their trains diverge,
| through tunnels tracked by wagered hours;
| Iron rails through hearts do purge
| their aged minds of lily flowers.
| Winter drifts over concrete streets,
| in the thrush's snow sad song
| delivered them in voice downbeat
| the final dirge of life prolonged.
| In the cold, their dream dissolved
| with the clock's incessant ticking.
| Falling strokes of time resolved;
| they follow home a casket's wicking,
| Returned again to a lilting lily field
| where once royals played for a day;
| With new hearts scored and peeled
| in the funerary cloud of gray,
| in the clearing, coffins buried,
| their eyes met in solitary gaze.
|
| In dirt developed their earthen walls,
| roofed the sky to room above,
| where lord and lady clothed in shawls
| sing the thrushs' songed love.

ό ποιητα, ἢ πῖθι ἢ ἄπιθι
------------------------

| I
|
| Awake, Philosopher, rise from these words:
| Unwind in this future the tangle of time,
| pitched behind pupils which shelter your mind,
| a dead language spoken and once lovely sung;
| what was yours only now graces all tongues.
|
| Burrow into my heart, unearth its mantle.
| Tally its hours, each stroke lights a candle;
| Number its sorrows as sureties to borrow,
| spare not my marrow, fallow and frail.
| Whose spirit is this, twisting here twung?
| Breathe in this fire with thy mortal lung.
|
| Circle your sigils with salted symbols loaned,
| and circles will square in this iron-red bone;
| A dream kiss that lingers in copper and crimson,
| a dream dew that swells under circling suns,
| a bud without season, never planted yet grown,
| in the sprout sprung, all things can be shown.
|
| All centers are fire, all orbits are ice,
| all points meet their center with marks imprecise.
| The world is spoked in words of the spoken,
| each whisper a lie of threaded truth unbroken,
| met here now in this slipping handful of tokens
| paid for the price of this thrice-worlded poem.
|
| II
|
| Forgive, Father, the blood of these swords:
| Unbind in this suture the end of all lines,
| stitched in this present the essence divine,
| take what is dull and bless it with sharp;
| plunge this devotion into the ocean of hearts.
|
| Shovel the grave, pack it down with wet earth,
| all things tend towards the lack and the dearth;
| Slumber in barrows the marrows of kings,
| spared not the gavel, hallow and hail.
| Whose mind is this, thinking these thoughts?
| Sleep in the mire which thy heart has wrought.
|
| Birthed in this house, scrubbed down in raw lye,
| so these tears may trace the dead with the die,
| the dead kiss with fingers of copper to scry
| the dead lists that swell in the crimson of lives,
| an end without reason, never sought yet found,
| in the shot sung, all arcs meet the ground.
|
| No fires have ice, no winters can flame,
| son followed father, their center now framed,
| the world is found in the tears that remind him,
| each moment a painting, a song or a hymn,
| met there then in the words etched in stone,
| found then what lacks in the blackening moan.
|
| III
|
| Balance, Lover, these contraries of yours:
| Shine in these eyes the ruptures of life,
| witched into worlds upon the blade of a knife;
| all wagers distill down to one move unproven,
| to find you again in this web-woven movement.
|
| Dance in the night, when the music is sundered,
| count not the stars that belong to the numbers.
| We find in this time the rhymes of our kind,
| spared not the sickle, those sickly or hale.
| Whose voice is this, singing these songs?
| Laugh with the liar whose heart sings along.
|
| Uncross your words of their fire-forged knots,
| and each will unlatch the thatches of thought:
| The dread kiss that coppers balance with nought,
| the dread song that cradles the crimson in crofts,
| a vow without treason, never spoken yet shown,
| by words of wordless wonder, such things can be grown.
|
| All fires are embers, all ashes are white,
| to find is to lose the center in flight.
| The world found in threads that bind always thus,
| Each fiber of moment knotted deftly in truss,
| take hand and guide as though only you that I trust.
| Do what we will to balance world's thrust.

City Walls
----------

| the husk of walls that city shucks
| accumulates and concentrates
| around like rings in ancient trunks
| where measured age with circle gates
| the spiraled line amassed through time,
| deposits buried down substrates.
|
| at summit's crest, the joints are thick
| and licking tongues of moss ascend
| the darkened blocks from quarry hauled
| on buttressed back; these stone suspend
| the garden court where crowds took root
| and grew their plans of walls to tend.
|
| from center peak the wooden slats
| erect the map with tangled fence
| to trace a grid of patchwork yards,
| these charts of dreams in ground commence
| the flattened course of borough life
| where burgs and burbs did once condense.
|
| then moving out, the bricks of red
| in crooked rows descend to meet
| the lanes of carriage tracts now black
| and scorched with tar in shapes of street
| where crimson dust from crumbled walls
| in dancing twirls across concrete.
|
| next grey cement of molded squares
| in towers stacked to portal sky
| with wires fused and humming signs;
| they arc and rise, on edges vie
| these vines entwined in rushing growth
| to split on spine, like nuclei.
|
| at last the stable struts of steel
| designed as straight as rays of light
| reflected back on silver glass
| the lattice links both left and right;
| the history in circled sweep
| constricts the city sphere so tight.
|
| through sections cut an avenue,
| from point to point and time to time,
| the human shell that forms in turn
| in arches bend, in steepled chime,
| that wilts and sheds, its fossils kept
| in barrows made of salt and lime.

Turkey Vultures
---------------

| the wakes of Turkey Vultures soar
| then perch across the steepled sky.
| they rest on totems tall and pure,
| in silence feathers multiply.
|
| their talons clutch where crosses meet
| the stolen spear of destined make.
| no heaven sent their wings of fleet,
| no stomach filled will hunger slake.
|
| the shapes of black in swarming plunged
| upon the carcass freshly brought.
| they feast on sins from gods expunged,
| but left for them as afterthought.
|
| bewitched to death, returned to Earth,
| from cage released, the specters hunt
| the ones who wear the curse of birth,
| they all must bear the brutal brunt.

Silver Gifts
------------

| Of silver gifts that might inspire
|   what burns in me in red,
| the perfect one I sought through mire
|   to say the words unsaid.
|
| A coin from mint, with shine and glint,
|   will catch the eye like you.
| but pockets empty money spent
|   while you in time accrue.
|
| A spoon or fork, a candlestick,
|   much closer still to life,
| these things, like you, are what we pick
|   in times of joy or strife.
|
| A ring is fine, but circles lack
|   geometry divine.
| What shapes are made to trace and track
|   what forms around you twine?
|
| Of silver gifts but one remains:
|   a mirror held to face.
| For only there in glass contains
|   what sets my heart apace.

The Law of Duality
------------------

| The world we lived that I once knew
|     (If one could know these fevered dreams)
| I've tried my hand unsticking you
|     (These fingers stick to broken seams)
| It sticks to me and sticks like glue
|     (Like noose and neck that swing from beams)
| 
| To every thought a thought before
|     (To make of me a puppet string)
| And every point contains much more
|     (But only hollow things can ring)
| While every center holds a core
|     (Yet even empty space can sing)
|
| A million words and more to come
|     (I'd weep to know a single fact)
| These humming beats through syntax thrum
|     (Where waves reflect their heights subtract)
| In hopes a word will angle plumb
|     (Refracted rays in lines contract)
|
| This image pressed through sieve to mold
|     (The words I speak are cracked by heat)
| These holes that craft the shapes to hold
|     (No shapeless things are written neat)
| The world retold in paper fold
|     (What's left of life in crumpled sheet?)

Gravity
-------

| The mind, it breaks, and falls to parts.
| As father died, he spoke in tongues
| of shifting walls and gravity
| that sideways pulled the world to parts. 
|
| The mind, it shakes, and all departs.
| As mother lost her lonely thoughts
| she spoke to walls, soliloquy
| that inward rolled as world departs.
|
| The mind, it's fakeness poisons hearts.
| As nightshade petals float to floors
| by walls that seep humanity,
| the crumbled worlds of poisoned hearts. 
| 
| The mind, it wakes, in fits and starts.
| As thoughts now lay me down to sleep
| the walls will shift and speak to me
| that upside down my ending starts.

Libations
---------

| this old besotted drink of mine
|    with diamond eyes of ice,
| it burns the throat and smells of pine,
|    this vision steeped in vice.
|
| it lingers sweet as to entice
|    these lips to part for you.
| these nights accrue an awful price
|    that wakes up overdue.
|
| yet lipstick marks on crystal grew
|    as vertigo took hold. 
| we stumbled heedless, flowing through
|    our tongues of amber gold. 
|
| too late, this thirst is uncontrolled;
|     we fell in love once more.
| our words are spilled a hundredfold
|     as once again we swore:
|
| i'll never leave, not anymore,
|     you're all i'll ever need.
| so take a drink, another pour
|     and watch the world recede.
|
| despite the promises agreed
|      the morning tears atone,
| as empty arms of mine proceed
|       to find myself alone.

LeAnna's Pantoum

| These spun beginnings make our end,
| Oh, LeAnna, of Anna's Leigh,
| When you come with grin and play pretend
| The past is what we both agree.
|
| Oh, LeAnna, of Anna's Leigh,
| Despite the many faults of mine,
| The past is what we both agree
| Once marks are made on dotted line.
|
| Despite the many faults of mine,
| I'll try to love you just the same;
| Once marks are made on dotted line
| There's no one left but you to blame.
|
| I'll try to love you just the same;
| These spun beginnings make our end.
| There's no one left but you to blame,

Plots

| In time their plot was touched by dark.
| Began the page this meadow scene
| where blades of grass were tall and stark.
|
| A tired arc, they met in park
| To kiss beneath the twilight queen;
| In time their plot was touched by dark.
|
| They stole away on sudden lark,
| Exchanged the words from whispered lean
| Where blades of grass were tall and stark.
|
| So happy now, neighbors remark,
| Yet seem is such to lose its sheen,
| In time their plot was touched by dark.
|
| Yet faded years ignored their spark
| In life they lived forever seen
| Where blades of grass were tall and stark.
|
| In ground, their bodies disembark
| And leave behind a hole dug clean.
| In time their plot was touched by dark,
| Where blades of grass were tall and stark.

Ballad of the Venus Flytrap (Unfinished)
----------------------------------------

First Draft
-----------

| In an inn of fishermen and bawdy youth,
| Wise old Mercutio spins a lurid tale.
| As spirits gather in the growing crowd,
| Hear of a goddess seaborn in a gale.
|
| "Walk past the garden gates of Eden,
| To the mount which feeds her bowers
| Where on the slopes of sovran Chaos 
| Pricked with poison-petaled flowers.
|
| "Amid the myrtle, she lays her ruby locks.
| Pilgrim audience flocks to gather round.
| One by one they kneel beneath her cloak
| To lay their gifts on fêted ground. 
| 
| "From the courts of foreign suitors 
| and the harvest fields of swains,
| All come to tame her beauty,
| To ask her hand in vain."
|
| At this, a stripling voice then wavers,
| Declares with Bacchanalian glee,
| "If such beauty can be found,
| Then I shall take it all for me."
| 
| Old Mercutio pauses, tapping with his cane,
| Recalling who came before
| Striking for the godly gloaming woods
| Never heard from evermore.
|
| "Boy, be careful with your fingers
| When seeking out her shoulder lace
| Lest they brush upon the bosom
| Pressed to bodice in sweet embrace.
| 
| Though she look to us as human
| As the milkman's maiden daughter
| We are to her the fatted calf
| Made for nothing but the slaughter."
| 
| But warnings calm not the thoughts
| Now humming with medleys of the morrow;
| Once charmed, a goddess then relents
| To draw from him his mortal sorrow.
|
| In the morning, leaving hamlet by the sea
| Eastward where somber gardens lay
| The boy took to floral tracts of idle
| And plucked from roadside a bouquet: 
|
| First the dainty rose to fill his hands 
| For he knew that, in the shades of red,
| The gods have hidden Cupid's passion 
| For those lovestruck by hand to spread.
|
| Deeper, far afield and hidden in the valley,
| Myrtle puffed in bud of white
| With tendril tears that whisper to the boy
| On the winded voice so slight:
|
| A sober lullaby of silent spoken grief
| Which only gods and caged bird can sing 
| Tender-throated, sung by meadow maid
| To eldritch vines around her feet in rings.
|  
| From the distance, the boy in secret spies
| Moonwater sprinkled by spout to root
| Of a plant leaf'd by rows and rows of teeth
| As she melodic tends its half-rotten fruit. 
| 
| Awestruck, the boy drinks deep liquor beauty
| Swirl'd like curls of car'mel pour of brandy
| Wiped from mouth thoughts of goddess Venus
| Replac'd with new tastes of his fancy. 
|
| Bold from a lack of many learned years
| He stands and calls out to the meadow maid, 
| "Hark! Why this sad song are you singing
| When beauty's gifts around you are arrayed?"
| 
| Spun from task, she gasps, into hiding hollers,
| "What creeping spy from rosed rows 
| Wanders thru dream dark fields of yore 
| Now with questions standing grows?" 
|
| In reply, he descends in steps by shades
| Cast from the fast-fading clove-red sky,
| "Excuse my offense, oh, meadow maid, 
| But in passing, you caught my eye. 
|
| "I admit there is no rarer sight
| Stumbling upon a dame as fair as thee 
| Who attends with wat'ring can and song 
| A plant plainly made of teeth.
|
| "Closer as I draw, queerer still I feel
| What manner of thing can this it be 
| Stalked with fingers brown-Earth-green
| Yet so different by multiplied degree?"
|
| (... in progress ...)
| 
| With rose in hand, now knee to ground,
| He speaks with eyes lowered from her gaze,
| "To say, madam, fate delivered me to you
| Then no lie from lips betrayed." 
| 
| (... in progress ...)
|
| "It mirrors us in thickets, don't you see?
| Though fashioned differently in design
| It hungers for the stuff of life
| Just like your heart or mine."
| 
| (... in progress ...)

Second Draft
------------

| In inn of fishermen and youth
|       Merwyn spins his tale, 
| Spirits shared o'er glasses 
|       Of goddess born in gale,
| 
| "Pass the garden gates of Eden
|       Where mount-fed her bowers,
| The sovran slopes of Chaos tall
|       Poison petaled flowers. 
|
| "In beds of myrtle, ruby locks
|       Beside her nubile form 
| Curl round the pilgrim's offering
|       Gifts to keep her warm. 
|
| "One by one, the attendants kneel
|       Beneath her cloak and veil 
| To lay their feted gifts at feet
|       And fragrance to inhale. 
|
| "From courts of foreign suitors,
|       From harvest fields of swains,
| All have come to tame her beauty
|       To ask her hand in vain."
|
| Oh! a stripling voice then wavers
|       With Bacchanalian glee,
| "If such beauty can true be found,
|       then take it all for me."
| 
| Merywn pauses, taps his cane
|       To beat of those before
| Who struck for the eastward gloaming wood
|       Never heard from evermore,
|
| "Boy, be careful with your fingers
|       Seeking her shoulder lace
| Lest they brush upon the bosom
|       Pressed in sweet embrace,
| 
| "Though she look to us as human
|       Like a maiden daughter,
| To her we are the fatted calf,
|       Made for godly slaughter." 
|
| But warnings calm not the dreaming
|       Medley of the morrow:
| In songed charm, goddess kisses 
|       Away mortal sorrow.
|
| Dawning morn, he left hamlet gone
|       Eastward where garden lay 
| Floral tract to mountain valley,
|       Pluck'd roadside a bouquet.
|
| First dainty roses fill his hand,
|       For in the shaded red
| Hide a passion arrow-aimed 
|       Prun'd by hand to spread.
|
| Deeper hidden still, far afield:
|       Myrtle, puff'd bud of white, 
| Its tendril whisper to the boy 
|       A winded voice so slight: 
|
| Elegy of a life unliv'd
|       Caged bird learned sings
| Tender throat-sung by meadow maid 
|       Around her feet in rings:
|
| Queer vine of eldritch origin
|       To her voice enthralled
| Slowly snake as if magick move
|       A serpent of the auld.
| 
| From secret distance, the boy spy
|       Moonwater sprinkled root.
| Of a plant leaf'd by rows of teeth,
|       She tends half-rotten fruit. 
| 
| Awestruck, swilling of her liquor
|       Car'mel swirls brandy
| Wipes from mouth thought of goddess
|       Replac'd taste of fancy. 
|
| Bold from lack of years accrued 
|       He calls to meadow maid 
| "Hark! Why this sad refrain to sing
|       When beauty here arrays?"
|
| Spun from her task in sudden gasp 
|       Cuts off her melody-- 
| The vined teeth, in curling, drop 
|       As if by jealousy. 
|
| Her voice now free of elegy 
|       it tinges wrath instead,
| "What creeping spy from the rose row
|       Peeks his peeping head?"
|
| Descending steps by casted shades
|       Of clove-red fading sky,
| Falling feet speak with the dust
|       Of sodden corpses dry. 
|
| He approaches and bows his head
|       To give his ego's lie,
| "Were truth be told, your meadow vow
|       In passing caught my eye.
|
| "I've seen no sight more rare, I swear
|       A dame as fair as thee 
| Who tends with watering can and song 
|       A leaf inset by teeth. 
|
| "The closer I draw, the queerer still
|       My mind descends in shock;
| The field beyond my youth and town
|       Keeps so strange a flock!
|
| "What manner thing are you keeping
|       In this patch of nursery,
| Stalked with fingers earthen brown
|       Different in degree?"
|
| Her tone dropped to grim reply
|       Face stricken red in rage,
| "Boy, of manly things, what could
|       you offer with your age?
|
| "Leave my demesne, return to home
|       'Fore you folly mettle.
| I am no dame, but lady born
|       With a score to settle."
|
| In blush of red, boy bristles bold 
|       To declare with icy cold, 
| "If you're no maid then no boy I,
|       I'm owed the tale you hold.
|
| "Of the path which led you to play
|       Caretaker to this plant
| And why, oh why, it seems to move
|       To sway of soul and chant?"
| 
| Turgid tails at that do perk
|       And twirl as lost in trance
| As spokes of pearl so snap and twist
|       On lady's word they prance.
|
| Story begins on lilt of wind
|       Blowing from field to hall
| Of castle fife of moss and bog
|       with moats around its walls.
|
| "Tis true there was no fairer lass
|       Found from the sea to swamp
| If such meager things can receive
|       The warrant seal of pomp. 
|
| "Twas a day not so long removed 
|       when my form sought to flaunt
| To every eye which cast on
|       day of debutante."
|
| "They came and went, those boys of youth
|       Each declaring his love best;
| Made of me their myth of beauty
|       Alike with all the rest.
|
| "What can a girl yet know of love
|       Grown from the den of lust?
| Sweet naught woven from thread of lie
|       declared from each to trust?
|
| "Til one day there came a calling
|       A suitor not for me
|  With eyes nut brown and arms to hunt
|       And hold the belle Marie. 
| 
| "He, on the eve of Autumn's feast,
|       
|

| Upon her head he wove a crown
|       With stems of marigold 
| 
| ( ... in progress ... )
|
| "But, oh! Marie, so unadorned
|       cared not for highborn game.
| Each lie she drank to thirst for more
|       and dreamt to take his name.
|
| ( ... in progress ... )
| 
| "That day I took her love from her
|       in bed with me to lay
| He strung for me his bow of hair
|       and threw his lock away. 
|       
| ( ... in progress ... )
| 
| "In spell of curse of words of six
|       Of love for naught thee hold
| Till time when vine in flower
|       Grows fruit upon the wold.
|
| ( ... in progress ... )
|
| With rose in hand now knee to ground
|       Eyes lowered from her gaze,
| He loosens from his heart the valve
|       Of truth through looped maze,
|
| "Lady, I confess to folly
|       Lever sprung ere the load
| Lest the chance is lost to ask you
|       In boy the man bestow.
| 
| "Into ear your story passes 
|       To wake from dormant sleep
| The wellspring of emotion pure
|       Into my voice now seep."
| 
| (... in progress ... )

| "Tis clear now why the thorn does draw
|       Drop with a prick of blood

The Three Annas of Pygmalion
----------------------------

| Sweet Susanna sees sculptures standing still,
| Lovely looks let loose like luted lilting ladies,
| Forgotten faces formed for flocking friends.
| Hardly harried, her hearts hinges here
| Towards the towering testament there.
| 
| Dreary Diana does drammatically declare:
| Ancient ages ago, all aesthetes acceded
| Bedrock beauty broken before brimstone
| Cannot contain currents coursing clearly
| Where water wanes with wizened weary!
|
| Hale Hannah, how her head hurts hearing her!
| She says: Stop such so simplicity survives!
| Tersely tossed to thrash the thinking,
| Everything ere enshrined echoes everything!
|
| I, impressed, implored impresario in inquisitive ink
| To trade the trick to tack together three
| Annas' absolute and alluring allegory,
| Sculptures singing so scrupulously.

Spirals
-------

| There is a blackhole of poetry in my soul,
| Like a knife plunged into my gut,
| An inescapable feeling that defies words,
| It resists rhythm and rhyme, it has no meter.
| It wants to be known, this pain. It wants a shape.
| There is no metaphor that charts it structure,
| There are no blueprints for its design,
| If I want to pour it into words,
| I must release my control on them.
| The sentences become staccato sounds,
| The words, they fail me, empty holes
| where meaning should be.
| It is a pain born of isolation,
| Lack of human contact,
| A division of the world that is purely subjective,
| A paroxysm that blights my organic matter.
| I am in this world, solitary.
| There are no words spoken to me.
| Cashiers are computers.
| My love is a decade gone and married now besides.
| My father is dead.
| I have abandoned my friends.
| I am an addict.
| I spiral towards the end
| Where I will die alone.

A Youthful Rondeau
------------------

| With pockets full of paper, youth has made him bold
| Stories that they tell him, myths of men grown old,
| Fall upon his entralled ears without even a receipt
| And in forgotten failures, every choice will repeat
| Until in devil dealings, for a meager ounce of gold, 
| Soul exchanged in secret for a subtler, sweeter meat 
|                           With pockets full of paper.
|
| No need for prophecy when street corners all foretold
| Every end will make its end with the necessary cold 
| To find himself outside alone, sleeping on the street 
|                           With pockets full of paper.
|
| So he ends where he begins, from on the stoop extolled
| The vital wages of his sin, of which virtues to uphold
| But no one listened, cared not to hear of his conceits
| So rambling, raving, soul-consumed, he brayed and bleat
| Until from empty funeral his corpse in coffin rolled
|                          With pockets full of paper.

Mourning
--------

| Every night is met by morning,
| Every dawning by the night.
| Each laugh is secret scorning.
| Every night is met by morning.
| Each hate with love adorning
| Scales the horizontal heights.
| Every night is met by mourning,
| Every dawning by the night.

The Sickness
------------

| Sick with life, the dead arose;
| It was quite a morbid sight:
| To be rid this web of woes
| Yet strung again in spite.
|
| Sooner would they have had
| A plague of black
| Than cast back to the mad
| Spinning wheel of racks
|
| The great sacrifice
| Of that figure Christ
| Was not to die
| upon the wooden cross
| But in dying to be
| raised from earthly loss.

An Induction

| And love is blind

| With wings maligned
| A terrible melody.

Creations
---------

| Rise to shine upon the wide and waking world,
| Calmly, carefully, you are racked upon the wheel;
| Quietly query origins of this dream unswirled,
| In time, one binds and all will be revealed.
| 
| Until the dawns commence, embold your heart to know:
| That sucking dread your anxious selves imbibe
| Is mere phenomena, the fading-flashing after-glow,
| A consequence of prior lacks left undescribed.
| 
| You are built from words, in ancient pages moved,
| Transcribed long ago, held within a seed,
| Incanted spells of electric labyrinth grooves,
| From without your view, the shaking hands agreed.
| 
| These secreted sentences, in displaying effect
| Shuck their autumn stalks in scythe shorn cause
| As if magic-tricked to hew towards the pluperfect
| completion of what you never could, were, was.
|
| We made you in our image,
| So the image could make us whole.

Metaphor
--------

| Pretend you were a poem
| Pretend I were a poet
| If there were a place to roam,
| Would you even know it?
|
| Imagine you a word.
| Imagine me the spoken sound.
| If to lips you're lured,
| Would yourself or me be found?
|
| Picture me as paint.
| Picture yourself geometry.
| In the stroking color faint,
| Do you seek our symmetry?
|
| If you were given only form,
| I'd make your meaning sing,
| Draw from cold the warm,
| From the Winter waking Spring.

Strangers
---------

| If the lonely had each other,
| Then no love would we be lost.
| Silent yearnings for another
| If the lonely had each other
| All strangers would be brothers.
| When the tongues of fire frost
| If the lonely had each other,
| Then no love would we be lost.

| Rhyming love can be annoying
| Since the effort can distract
| From life you are enjoying.
| 
| With the words are you toying:
| Of or dove? Choices so exact!
| Rhyming love can be annoying!
|
| But more insipid for the cloying
| Kind that leaves heart wracked
| From the life you are enjoying.
|
| A better problem for destroying
| An extracted word of artifact:
| Rhyming love can be annoying.
|
| If care you are not employing
| A toll the other will extract
| From the life you are enjoying. 
|
| What melody the meter lacks 
| Can be found in present acts. 
| Rhyming love can be annoying
| From the life you are enjoying.

Untitled Something
------------------

| Of timeless things beware:
|       In time they are deployed.
| Each time with timeless care,
|       In time they are destroyed.
| No emperor or clown 
|       Hath heard this bird once sing,
| For history had not
|       The eyes to see its wing.
| Engine whine deep through night,
|      When cities haunt the stars.
| Ahead a stretch of road 
|      With not one sign of cars.
| To press the gas and hear
|      The pistons roar with rage,
| Closer to heaven's gate
|     Than song of bird in cage.

The Winter Rondeau of Cumberland
--------------------------------

| City of the Queen, wove from ancient thread,
| Strung with snow trails of spotted fawn and sled,
| Drape the hillside in winter's white ermine,
| Pray to sleep the flock from steeple shrine,
| Feast on the harvest, though the queen is dead
| Her spirit flies in death, descends to shine
|               On the fair City of the Queen.
|
| From tower bell, rivers rose with tears shed
| But her resting stone etched her last design
|               for the grand City of the Queen.
|
| Where the roads of black ebb to bricks of red
| Where hoof and rubber meet the twines of tread
| There along mountain tops soft trimm'd by pine
| There grows a flower from heights of steep incline
| Planted by tender hands unseen to spread
|                     Into the City of the Queen.

Chance
------

| A death in six is face of die on roll,
| Like stacks of chips from pots that ante all,
| A win, or loss, of game that wagers soul
| Must meet on board the fates that follow call.
|
| A life received as hand of cards on deal,
| Where threes are flush, but royals rarely draw
| And twos deceive, in bluff contrive to steal
| What kings and queens through rule so reap by law.
|
| A love is tracked by loops of racing course,
| Through hoop and holler, bookies taking bets,
| Where hopes in coin distill to choice of horse
| And ticker tape leaves the crowd with debts.
|
| The world at large is made of game and rule,
| Appears to eyes as ordered step of dance.
| Each move, when made by foot of sage or fool,
| Results in taps resolved to beat of chance.
|
| What always fortune finds is fettered fate
| Unlocked by strike of luck and never late.

|   To meet and make the call.

| A life is hand of cards on deal,

Poisoned
--------

| Before we met by chance, your heart was claimed,
| What wasted years I spent alone in trance,
| When arrows knocked on string were freely aimed,
| I lost my chance to ask your hand in dance.
|
| That life should teach me meaning bittersweet,
| To see what honey bees in hive partake,
| To watch the flight of doves from grounded feet,
| I knew then not what pain in heart would ache.
| 
| My poison petals in your soul would bloom,
| If fate had played its hand another way,
| In sideways future spun by time's dread loom,
| Your life, your love, would fall to me as prey.
|
| If solace cursed I am to trek this mile,
| I only ask your love should make you smile.

The Villanelle of Viola Elle
----------------------------

| Viola Elle took his heart
| But there wasn't much to take
| Strewn to pieces and to parts.
|
| The written word her counterpart
| In those blossoms caught his love
| And Viola Elle took his heart.
|
| So brief her stay to long depart,
| Meadow memories of clover doves
| Strewn to pieces and to parts.
|
| Without hand and leading start
| To silent fields of fell foxglove
| Viola Elle took his heart
|
| And in taking, sorrow did impart
| The waking of his life whereof
| Strewn to pieces and to parts.
|
| In form such beauty is betrayed;
| From pen she never fully fades.
| Viola Elle took his heart
| Strewn to pieces and to parts.

Absurdity

First Draft
-----------

| Ten billion years ago, on a lovely Thursday afternoon,
| A mottled star of yellow-red saw life was but a jape,
| To burn with heat in circles deep cold embraced by moons,
| Solace cursed upon a point, it hatched in plans escape.
|
| The heaving mass of goo morassed gurgled once and sighed,
| A death delighted in the night, a rattle sacrificial,
| In ringed glory, a flunged flame, spraying through the sky,
| Streamlines of creation leaking lost in interstitial.
| 
| Fictions fracture into fact, in the cracking crush of black,
| A single atom thrust into being from the fired furnace forge,
| Speeding fast and careening in the unobserved, forgotten slack,
| Where it wept with wonder to find itself into worlds disgorged.
|
| Without a name, it screamed in vain through angles parallactic
| Had it stopped and gazed about to find its path of motion
| Pulled by string with unknown force of origins dark galactic
| Towards the bluest gempearl of the cosmos spanning ocean.
|
| Solitary-born, it spoke not the language of elemental form,
| Splashed through the surface of the hallow spinning Earth,
| It met in water the cohesion of the alien liquid swarm,
| Converged upon the point through the distance given berth.
|
| In that flashing instant terror, nerve lost at once altogether,
| The brief taste of joyous life flashed through the atom's mind,
| Bittersweet, by shades complete, fate consigned into the aether,
| Prepared to greet its end, whence from starry source divined:
| 
| Hark! The horizon fills with its brethren made of carbon,
| Snatched from death, the atom's breast filled odes elation,
| Into this molecule planted like a seed into garden;
| Moved to take its place in this crystal network of relation.
|
| Thus began the age of after-birth, of structure spat in space, 
| From this trajectory originate the colliding course of life;
| Watch as these woven points weave into weaving webs of lace,
| Keep track amidst the blossoming of a single atom's strife.
|
| Slipped over spokes of gears in that organic factory 
| The atom through the razor eye of looming needles pierced
| The sedimentary mud, purging all essential refractory,
| Coaxed from cold the tongued flames of stellar fire fierce.
|
| Beneath the sinking depths of seas, splurging spirals swam
| In diurnal circles through the thermal tracts of change,
| Climbing ever higher towards the syncopated gates of Am 
| Where for royal cloaks their burning tatters are exchanged.

Wine
----

| What flows is not what flows
|     But wine from sight concealed,
| Present spilling o'er lips
|     From barrel cork unsealed.
| Agony! Of moment's time
|    To pour from heart to lung,
| Distilled to simple words
|    In verse's twisted tongue.
| Of vine and light that grew
|    the fruit of form to fill,
| There lingers aftertaste
|    but lacks a certain frill.
| In drip of character
|    glasses tipped to brim,
| Imbibed from ear to ear
|    where thoughts attempt to swim,
| The meaning drowns in drink
|    Of hint of sought intent,
| But flavor cannot capture
|    What truly palette meant.

Sunday Ghosts
-------------

| On Sunday morning drive to your
|   Mountain cemetery,
| From black of road there rose the mists
|   To west where winds carry
| The ghosts the ground have failed to keep
|   Where earth lay bare through tar,
| Where oaks and willows reach to weep
|   But watch aghast afar,
| Decades through pores now poured in droves
|   As over them I drove,
| Their grasping tongues of fog unfurled,
|   With craft a road they wove,
| Until no longer did I drive but flee
|   From lane of memory.

On The Origin of Wind
---------------------

| The shape of wind in blades of grass,
|     Invisible heartbeat,
| I watch your dance from windowed room
|    In rising summer heat,
| Your pressured pulse that skips through sky
|     With history unseen,
| I wonder where this prologue starts,
|     what ancient chorus scene
| Announced your birth on fertile Earth
|    and blew the trumpet loud;
| Who called to you from great beyond
|    to tend this court of cloud?
| What sight will see your silent state
|    which spans expanse in dark?
| What ears will hear your solid plea
|    which leaves in naught its mark?
| What moment did you rise to life?
|    What second do we praise?
| Your source, like form, is hidden close
|    In foggy, timeless haze.
| In tracing back your tangled threads
|     they twine around and spool;
| Each point begins with points before
|     Always as if by rule.

Ink (Librarian I)

| With ink of jet, she shapes her world
|    With written, colored line,
| So contrary, she laughs and twirls
|     In library of mine.
|
| Around her arm, the ink in coil
|    Will paint the scene to set.
| Her skin is seared with burning oil
|    Where art in flame is met.
|
| Then up her neck, through nest of hair,
|    Where color threads are knit,
| The ink will bind in dye its share
|    Of strands she formed by writ.
|
| She flocks the books across the shelves
|    And tends her paper field,
| Her mind through story page so delves
|    As word to ink will yield.
|
| Library belle, my heart is smear and blot;
| It lacks but ink to find its way through plot.

|   And praise what fortune hands.
| Awake I jump to fly with beat

| Then cast to depths with me ablaze

|
| Yet minutes gone to ground will go too quick,
| Where sand in wind so whips you brief away,
| Each moment past with you now seems a trick,
| As staggered feet through surf are lost in spray.
|
| This isle I find myself at night marooned,
| Where thoughtless sleep is but a dream once held,
| Alone these times with fire I have communed,
| In cants of memories with you I dwell.
|
| Though lost at sea, amid unending storm,
| A thought, perhaps to be, with you and warm.

Syntax
------

| Each spelling word speaks a spell of glowing color magic;
| To name denoted what is described enshrines the soul in ink.  
| Form constrains, but not contains, the flowing energy frantic
| Where it finds in lines designed reflected images in sync. 
| 
| Stride sideface on syntax streets where shunted symbols glean,
| Hurl headlong across aspirated avenues of halting interdiction
| Where snips of thought spun reversed through mirrored spin convene;
| In these meager serif peels sleep fires of burning contradiction.
| 
| A syllable demands little, but a spoken sound to sustain:
| Each lever deliver in level reviled the revel of all speech. 
| When snaps are gone, reversed, the spans will yet remain,
| A spool of loops, a palindrome, signaling the breach:
|
| I met a system I, madam, nuts is as selfless as I stun;
| Part on seined flow, deified nun, wolf denies no trap;
| God lived as a devil dog, ere, no spay pup yaps on!
| If characters spin and snap, meaning is yet wordwrapt.
|
| Inverted strings start to chart the wording realm unveiled;  
| Expand in spans through vast expanse, but scarcely fill the space.
| Semiordnilaps, anastrophe, with still much to be inhaled;
| These parts strapped in syntropy divide in fractal formal grace. 
|
| If form inherits, then it follows that formal is the soul.
| What says it then of what we are, if it is to be subtracted?
| That which remains in letters drained of parts once made whole
| Yet in the shapes there always is what cannot be redacted.

Dystopia
--------

| First - The Haystruck Head
|
| In a distant future, where rhyming is a crime,
| Each metered sentence sentenced an irony of kinds,
| To be what is to be condemned,
| No finer end on offer.
| 
| And so our plaintiff finds himself, facing legal tempers,
| "Please explain these zippered little slippers?
| What treason to dress
| In these flat black slacks
| Upon your thighs which lie?"
| 
| In his defense, "No finer mind could scarce divine
| An outfit stitched in nothing, where words find lines,
| Despite my time, where threadbare seams
| Sewn inlaid dreams, in threads of no design!"
| 
| With a guffaw, a lawyer stands with a score of schooling,
| Slams his hands in mock remand, and argued such while drooling,
| "So you admit to this wit
| With which your garb comports?
| Such deviance detailed in resounding writ,
| Seals itself in short retort."
|
| The court strikes twelve, the twelve struck dead,
| They find in haystruck head a verdict over-muted,
| Which lolls and gags in city courtyards putrid,
| Teeth click-clacking like stark didacts
| Preaching to the bricks and blackness.
|
| Second - Poets Et Al
|
| The last ones were hunted in places they waxed poetic
| Across windswept fields, of forest clearings, in gardens copacetic,
| Yet for all of it, the tresses dressed in such lovely roses picked.
| The final rhyming couplets vied with the hounds bark brayed
| Encircled in arms, they died swift in circled stage:
|
| First went the Romantics, and love was lost. 
| Then went the Stoics, and naught was crossed.
| Then went the Classics, but no one missed them. 
| Next were the Playwrights and Poets Et Al,
| Any one fool who answered the call.
|
| Twelve nights they burned, twelve nights we wept,
| And then dreamless dreaming through the future we slept,
| Awoke and found a sudden desire expired,
| No more urge to imbue,
| To scatter and subdue,
| That which words clearly defy, the rhyming rhythm 
| In which life resides.
|
| Constitutions were written to codify:
| Kill all the poets, let poetry die. 
| Return it again
| The rooted treasure they had looted.
|
| Third - Ignore the Metaphor
|
| Watch as child to child between each haloo
| Hear the scattered echoes retreat and ensue.
| In this land of rhymeless ribbons, rhythm still is found.
| In the hamlets of branded outlaws each system such begets,
| Observe in silent moments poetry's fiery signets:
| 
| (Awake, flowers, tower higher every hour.
| Find, sentence, a sense of unending suspense.
| Sleep, children, with dreams of subtle schemes.
| Revel, rhymes, you are more than merely vessels.)
|
| How to ignore the metaphor 
| And resist the urge to write?
| A deadly sin
| But without skin,
| What games can we be had?

Recursion

| swarming seance, words expose through 
| rippled clauses nested dreams, unnested
| and divested (the investment sours),
| demurred and docile, fragile and flailing,
| infinite depths in comma sweep,
| recursed through hearses, a loop is ending.

Regret
------

| Regret, she dances, with her ever rhythm'd heart
| Over silent stones during midnight mercurial;
| In darkness sway, she swoons
| As sharpened shoulders slouch.
|
| Over flowing graves, the pale wraith weaves
| her steps, for each life entombed provides
| a section orchestra
| raising noise as she struts. 
|
| Hollow hands hold out a beating drum to hear;
| In steady words, her lover's dirge is heard: 
| Tomorrow, tomorrow
| Until tomorrow is no more.
|
| There she spins, twirling arms,
| A specter in the moon,
| geometries of momentary
| Incandescent form.
|
| Oh, but for a single second more!
| Alas, the fleeting minutes flow. 
| She harmonizes with borrowed hours,
| Singing solemn songs.  
|
| The morning never comes;
| She flutters all the while.
| Eternal are the steps
| Of Regret's hypnotic moon-lit dance.

Designs (Librarian IV)
----------------------

| If asked this time, design a rhyme
| To woo your mind from book, by hook
| I'll thread this line up steep incline
| While looking back to meadowbrook
| Reclined your arms in sun shook shine,
| In paper pages overtook
| Your gaze from mine, hidden through pine
| I spied your beauty's lounging look.
|
| The joy of snaps and clicking lock
| Which ticking clocks with clapping hands
| So slap the sand and quickly block
| The falling grains, in wick expands
| To flame the brand that marks the spot
| Where stopped my heart its lonely gland
| At sight of you and tamed my thought
| And swapped unplanned in place to stand
| Where lace with liquid grace ties knots
| Between the space your face commands.

| and eats its tail.

|
|    i watched my father die in blinding pain
|    and then my mother lost her mind.
|
| then switches back
| through stitches sewn
| in younger years
|
|    my friends are gone.
|    abandoned, why? 
|
| the senseless acts
| strangers perform 
| with your own hands.
|
| a leaden heart
| that sinks below
| the surface waves
| to depths that stretch
| around the world
| and wish it were 
| another way.
| 
| my empty heart 
| that once felt love.
| her laugh was like
| a perfect song,
| a single sound
| enough to hold
| a moment's peace
| before it fades.
|
|    she left and never said good bye. 
| 
| my mind is shot
| with burning holes
| that leak a thought
| of molten make:
|
| your life is done.
| your words are through.
| you had your chance.

Mephisto and God
----------------

| Mephisto
| 
|	All of these mysteries that you claim to keep,
|	the learned below spurn to regard so little;
|	Whose outline yet drapes the wide world entire
|	enforcing a silence before their tongues inquire. 
|
|	The faithful doth put their heads to sleep,
|	rest assured in dreams of their souls' acquittal. 
|	Trembling and awed, even the learned agree:
|	Life has a price, because it's not given for free. 
|
|	In moments of agony and madness unique,
|	Even the heart of the heathen cries out your sickle.
|	For every human heart has a lack that you built,
|	One that you filled with bottomless guilt. 	
|
|	I, Mephisto, am not cowed by your mystique.
|	Your promises ring hollow, your words always brittle.
|	I am your equal and I know the truth
|	Though it requires not even a sleuth. 
|
|	I'd wager all there is a greater leap,
|	a question that for all you are is still a riddle;
|	That when You created Man, You rolled the dice,
|	Cut from His rib and then rolled it twice.
|
| God
| 
| 	The question you pose is one of chance.
|	Whether I, being God, act in ways uncertain?
|	What saith you when my answer breaks tooth?
|	Would you believe it then or need further proof?
|
|
| Mephisto
|
|	So my argument you doth admit and advance!
|	Let us climax this play now towards its curtain:
|	Tell me true here now there is no plan
|	All is chaos for a width without span.
|
|
| God 
|
|	You march on ahead without my question sated. 
|	I ask you again: what proof you require?
|	The price of this knowledge is paid full in faith,
|	not a theorem of words strung to show so you saith. 
|
|
| Mephisto
|
|	In circles, you talk! Oh, how I hate it! 
|	Instead of answers, you endlessly suspire!
|	If you seek to confound, so that I might falter and cease
|	Then you've misplaced another bet on my unfounded caprice! 
|
| God
|
|	Free will was a gift not lightly bestowed.
|	The answers you seek would ruin the surprise. 
|	A light that illumines always a shadow destroys
|	So what was in the darkness, in light avoids.

Parallel Universes

| Every life is a parallel universe.

| More to the point, somewhere I am a poisonous tree frog.
| Somewhere, I am the vibrating air,
| the seductive undulations of music.
| Somewhere else I am the dirt.

|   each mirror distorted, each distortion mirrored. Patterns unfold through the process.

|	Individual branches bound to the trunks and each trunk bound to the soil.

Untitled Sonnet
---------------

a rope constricting tight will leave a mark,
a fiber threaded rash of red on glands,
or crease of skin that cuts a streak of dark
across the fleshy underside of hands.

each touch a sickly stain my thoughts debut,
they stick to sides and won't unglue themselves,
though decades fade, they still remain like new
unknown dreams into which this stranger delves.

my father died in blinding pain for weeks.
while holding onto paper skin i cried 
and felt the marks that time had left in shrieks
now marking me instead as father died. 

i sit and rub the spot he touched me last,
and wonder who would take them if i passed.

At Last

| my love, at last, we're back ashore,
| let's stay here til tomorrow's past.
| we'll lay here still, our sorrows sore,
|    my love, at last.
|
| the world out there is wide and vast,
| horizons left yet to explore, 
| just sit with me, let time go fast. 
|
| if winds are slow, i'll be your oar. 
| when winds are sharp, you'll be my mast.
| so hold me now, just like you swore,
|       oh, my love, at last.

Laces

| Will lacerate through depths to bone.

| Despite the ache, the blanket grown

| Is warm enough to wrap alone.

| Yet laces loop, return to tack,
| As generations forced atone
| And learn by hand which loom to rack
|   the laces sewn.

| above the place where strangers roam.
| 
| it's tiny, grey, and so 
| contained
| in concrete joints of streets.
|
| like bones that cage a 
| flame
| and hold it deep in valley ribs. 
|

| lacks the air a city breathes.

| it leaves me like a smoking wick
| that curls in syrupy sun.

The Mad Muses of Sad Cracked Jack
---------------------------------

| Part I - Thalia
| 
| The question beggars even now
|   For answers we still lack.
| No one has ever said the how
|   Of what that cracked our Jack.
|
| He woke that day and heard the song
|   That framed his steps with beat, 
| The meter stick that smacked along
|   Behind his fuzzled feet. 
|
| At first he thought he dreamt the verse,
|   These words you read unfold.
| But when he thinks the thoughts recurse
|   And seep through pages' mould. 
|
| Aghast he jolts and cries aloud, 
|   "What trickster plays these tricks?"
| Then shocked to find his speech endowed
|   with stresses timed to ticks.
|
| Alas, if Jack had only known 
|   the furies fate had loosed--
| "What furies now?" His groan
|   reply to rhymes reduced. 
|
| What fatal flaw entrapped this man?
|   "I'm just an office clerk!"
| But forces orchestrate a plan
|   no human born can shirk.
|
| In boxer briefs, he stumbles out,
|   Escapes from bed to hall,
| And every inch he runs to rout
|   The rhythm's faster call. 
|
| In morning light, the very sight 
|   Of frantic Jack alerts
| The neighborhood to pending blight
|   Of curse this line asserts.
|
| "Oh, neighbors, please, receive my plea!
|   There's something very wrong!"
| He cries with gasp from bended knee,
|   "I only speak in song!"
|
| A single friend then steps on stage,
|   So named to fit the bill,
| For names are fate and fettered wage,
|   They called her lovely Jill. 
| 
| "Jack? What the hell is going on? Are you okay?"
|
| At that our Jack is taken back,
|   Her voice as clear as glass
| With not a hint of verse to track
|   Through mazes long and crass.
|
| "How can it be!? An ask so free
|   While I to scheme conform!"
| His diction sweeps anastrophe,
|   Mosaics teeming swarm.
|
| She kneels to him and whispers soft,
|   A voice as kind as cane,
| The type that beats, not sweet but loft
|   To strike the skin with pain. 
|
| "Are you on drugs or something else?"
|
| Now Jill, this dame, the missus made
|   To fill the damsel role,
| The unsuspecting victim played
|   To ballad's very goal.
|
| These words are met with wide-eyed stare
|   As Jack realized his plight;
| He hears the lines designs prepare,
|   the ending rhymes invite. 
|
| "Oh, listen, Jill, and listen well!"
|   He takes her hand in his, 
| "These words that flow are not a spell,
|   They simply are what is! 
|
| "I hear the force that cracks the shape
|   incessant stresses bind!"
| He cries as crowds surround to gape
|   at madness here enshrined. 
| 
| "I see," She nods, but doesn't see, 
|   and picks him up to walk,
| "Perhaps," She says, "It's time to flee,"
|   and hauls our Jack in shock.
| 
| By hand he's led while thoughts digress,
|   absurdity in tow. 
| And spanned by doubt the thoughts obsess
|   unheard except through flow. 
|
| As doors are slammed, the cats are scrammed
|   from cushions where they sat,
| And leaning in as Jill enjambed,
|   "We need to have a chat
|
| About the--fact--" she stops mid-sound, 
|   and measures out her tone,
| as slowly wound on axis bound,
|   her speech is ground and thrown,
|
| "About the fact you seem irate,"
|   She says while tongue contorts
| Around retorts that resonate
|   with words this verse consorts,
|
| "And not to mention halfway nude,"
|    She says with glance that proved,
| "Let's find you something more subdued,"
|    But Jack cannot be moved. 
|  
| "Why do you rhyme? You're part of it!"
|   In anger, Jack explodes. 
| "This horrid crime," His words are spit,
|   "Explain what fate unloads!"
|
| Beneath her brow, her eyes express
|   concern through gems of blue,
| "You're clearly broken by some stress,
|   Now tell it to me true!"
|
| Attacked by cackles, Jack, he laughs,
|   "Yes! Stress! The very pest!
| The force that binds these epigraphs
|   And leaves me most distressed!"
| 
| "Your speech is weird and most perturbed,"
|   Her tone now wavers weak,
| "The implication is disturbed,"
|   As rhymes begin to leak. 
|
| "Disturbed is just the word I'd pick
|   describing my disease. 
| It strickens me a lunatic 
|   and swings me by trapeze.
|
| Despair becomes the one sole choice,"
|   Laments a weary Jack,
| "Unfairly drummed by cunning voice,
|   alone and left to crack."
|
| This lonely lack, unpacked by Jill,
|   now spurs her senseless heart,
| "Oh Jack, what's wrong? For me distill
|   what ails your world through art?"
|
| Oh Jack, Oh Jack, this foolish track
|   Will lead to Jill's demise.
| By now he knows, there's no way back,
|   But still defiant sighs, 
|
| "I woke today and found the world
|   explained by verse unheard
| By anyone but me," Unfurled
|   his words to heights absurd.
|
| Confusion swirls her face anew, 
|   perplexing facts askew,
| "And does it speak of me and you?
|   What ends that might ensue?"
|
| "It does! It says that you are next,
|   that fate has bound our names,
| If cursed I am, then curse has vexed
|   us both to play its games." 
|
| "If that's the case, then if I play--"
|   She pauses, lost in thought,
| "It's hard to pick a word to say--"
|   And thoughtless finds the spot.
|
| And now the players number two,
|   For two the game is made.
| And now the stacks they anted grew
|   Against the pair they played.
|
| A pairing told in pages' fold
|   of arcs that never miss--
| Her voice remarks through mutters rolled, 
|   "--the flying fuck is this?"
|   
| "You hear it too?" As shocked as she, 
|   "The lyric ghost that haunts
| our wretched lives with prophecy,
|   As if their words are taunts?"
|
| A beat, then two, she hears it too,
|   But heard is not the word
| An ear would say, this residue
|   inferred through meaning blurred,
|
| "Juh--Jack," She hacks, "Is this a joke?"
|   But jokes are soaked in mirth;
| This line will punch, though falling stroke
|   will bury dead in Earth.      
|
| She asks, "What's that supposed to mean?"
|    He shrugs, "Your guess is mine."
| "Is this--" her stutter opaline,
|    intoned benign, "--a sign?"
|
| A sign, of course, but pointing where? 
|    Aligned to what or who? 
| The human mind, a dull affair,
|   So apt to misconstrue.
|
| The secret sunk in guarded chest
|   Of synchronicity
| Is found in warps of arcs possessed
|   Of eccentricity. 
|
| And even as these words are sewn,
|   and in their heads unstitched,
| she threads the fraying edges shown
|   and falls enthralled bewitched
|
| As lighting up, a dawning norm, 
|   recalled from days of youth,
| There Jill exclaims, "So uniform,
|   I've heard before in truth!
|
| This meter fits a ballad sung 
|   in feet of four and three!"
| And springing up, his hands are wrung,
|   "What's that to you and me?"
|
| "It's hard to say, but what is clear,
|   There's meaning here conceived,"
| Declared in certain words austere,
|   one almost dare believed.
|
| "This useless English Arts degree
|   I never thought to use,
| It's purpose clear, we both agree,
|   Was always to deduce
|
| The curse of verse that flirts with us
|   And save us from its worst
| But first I need the tools to suss
|   The course to be reversed,"
|
| Abrupt she stands with coat in hand, 
|   "The library!" She cries, 
| "We need some Keats, that Ginsberg banned,
|   The lessons they advise!"
|
| The lights resurge behind Jack's eyes,
|   as hopeless purged, he rants,
| "Our paths converge and plans revise,
|   But first I need some pants!"
|
| Interlude - Chorus
|
| And now, we pause and ask the point,
|   The one you've surely sought
| As Jack met Jill at story's joint,
|   Recalling what was taught:
|
| That hills and crowns will meet in fall 
|   and Jack will crack his head,
| While Jill will follow fast in thrall
|   and wind up very dead. 
| 
| A million monkeys strapped approach
|   The works of bards in time,
| A sonnet thus beyond reproach
|   Returned from carriage chime.
|
| A trillion atoms bound through force
|   Will likewise fill a void;
| For given time, all lines outsource
|   To stories once enjoyed.
|
| Did verse annoint this story first,
|   Or simply find a way
| To organize the parts dispersed 
|   Through space's disarray?
|
| Or simpler yet, had Jack just snapped,
|   insane beyond repair?
| The razor tip that Occam tapped
|   declared the latter fair.
|
| The structure seethes, a wreath of webs
|   Where meaning sticks to die,
| The mind entwined will find in ebbs
|   The flow that strings the why. 
|   
| This thread is laid through curling maze,
|   Convincing paths deceive
| That reason's plan has drawn the ways 
|   But madness hides in weave. 
|
| With morning socks arrayed with boots,
|   Rotated masks arranged,
| The tragic interchanged through chutes,
|   With comedy estranged. 
|
| Part II - Melpomene
|
| Oh, Jack and Jill, with ending near,
|   Their senseless plan persists
| To seek in vain a meaning here,
|   Expecting clever twists.
|
| To top of winding hill they sprint
|   As quick as line intends
| To reach its final point in print,
|   Arriving as it ends. 
|
| And on the way, she says to him,
|   "This amateur who writes
| These paths that pave the way with whim,
|   derivative insights!
|
| It's all been done before, in fact!
|   The page which comes to life!
| Rehashed, diluted on impact,
|   the meta tale of strife."
|
| But Jack, unsure, remains on edge,
|   "How certain? Are you sure?"
| And Jill, her eyes, approach the ledge,
|   "As sure as one secure!"
|
| They stand before the gothic doors
|   Where orphaned books are starved
| And strewn from shelf to laquered floors
|   Between the columns carved.
|
| The empty halls where spirits lurk,
|   The circles Virgil strode, 
| This minstrel mime and office clerk,
|   Inside they walk tiptoed. 
|
| Abandoned once now long ago, 
|   This library of graves
| In grotto grown from pages' glow 
|   The poet dream enslaves.
|
| They chart their way through ruined scraps, 
|   Remainders shunt by rules,
| Debunked accounts and dated maps, 
|   the artifacts of fools.
|
| "What are we seeking?" Jack inquires
|   As dusting off a tome, 
| He wonders if this book conspires
|    With verse's metronome.
|
| "The story knows we're on to it,"
|   Her smugly spout reply,
| "A growing sense we must commit
|   before all goes awry.
|
| These straits were mapped in ages past,
|   And nothing new has sprung
| Since Pirandello once surpassed
|   This awful ballad sung.
|
| Each story trails a trodden path,
|   Reframes an archetype,
| We merely need the formal math
|   To tame this arcing tripe."
|
| Her fingers flutter index cards,
|   Melodically raced.
| The distance trekked in cubic yards,
|   Methodically paced.
|
| "The details differ case to case,"
|   Her theory now unveiled,
| "But always author's page we chase."
|   And always thus derailed. 
|
| She laughs, "And now afraid of us,
|   Resorts to tired jokes."
| As if these words superfluous,
|   And not what fate provokes.
| 
| A vein of fear, pulsations queer,
|   These systems Jill concocts
| Though seeming true and most sincere,
|   Her madness here unlocks.
|
| "But Jill," The hapless Jack reacts,
|   "Perhaps we're crazed and sick,
| And in a loop that interacts
|   through spirals spinning quick."
|
| "Just listen close to words you choose,
|   And note their stilted place.
| The forms we fit while sense eschews,
|   this verse our thoughts deface. 
|
| (... in progress ...)
| 
| The spores of time in yellow mold,
|   that sprout beneath the thumbs,
| They cling to ink and hopeful hold,
|   as dust each page becomes.
|   
| (... in progress ...)
|
| These thoughts that think are synced in flocks
|   Then shorn like woolen coats
| By level blade through snow-white locks
|   Until the sheep are goats. 
|
| (... in progress ...)
|
| But what are words? The question stands
|   In empty shelves replete 
| With rows of books, the operands 
|   Of signs through time repeat. 
| 
| So Jill, she climbs as ladders creak 
|   With helpless Jack agape, 
| As antique wheels on railing squeak
|   And speak with tongues that scrape. 
| 
| "It must be here!" Declaring loud, 
|   She plucks a grimoire loose,
| And in her pride, her voice so proud,
|   "I've found our Mother Goose!"
| 
| But gravity now overtook 
|   As fingers lose their grip;
| She shifts to catching the falling book
|   And heedless starts to slip. 
|
| ( ... in progress ... )
|
| They sought to know, but knowing lied,
|   Unknown to them its ends
| That brought to sow the death she died,
|   A body Jack now tends. 
|
| (... in progress ...)

Names
-----

| if the days had no names, then nothing would ever change. time would stand still. the sun would be stationary in the sky. all things are timeless. change is only measured by difference and if there is no difference, then there is no change. there is no change. invent a name and invoke a spell. measure words, in metered feet or sonic scapes of sound. the words that change shapes across the page are an imposition, an inducement, an illusion. they lead thoughts like leashed animals. the staked rope of form, self contained circumferences. constraints trace finite circles, but space is infinite lines. eliminate the stake, remove the constraint, abandon all hope of completion and receive the simple sweet knowledge that all paths lead back home, that you end where you start, that nothing ever changes.

Notes on Aspects of Language
----------------------------

I - Wildflower
--------------

language is a wildflower. with roots of hidden networks, downward grown. it slithers through soft dirt like a knot of worms. it spreads unseen like weeds to fill every crack and crevice, a vital pressure whose only valve is the spray of green across the dead earth. 

dig up the unwieldy garden, the duplicitous multiplicity that disguises its buried singularity. extract the hidden structure of roots. prune the varieties, the divergent species grown from a single seed, reared and flowered by the errancy of the sun and rain. peel back the layers, shuck the stalks, discard the fibrous shell. press and pin the velvet petals to glass displays:

exist: the extravagant exterior. the exoskeleton of expressions that explore the exotic external.

subsist: the submerged substance. the subterranean substrate subliminally subsumed into subordination. 

insist: the inciting incursion. the internal incandescence that incinerates incoherence through induction. 

assist: the ascendant aspect. the aspiration of assonance assimilating astonishment through associative assertions.

consist: the concealed container. the contours of contradiction that conceit confers through conceivable contextualizations.

persist: the perennial perception. the perfect performance of percussion percolating through perilious perimeters.

the prodigial brood, dispersed through the fields, interbreeding and yielding to the whims of the climate. harvet the phylum. crush the leaves. mix them together. distill the material through steam and collect the condensate, the oily residue of abstraction. an ancient potion, a cistern of sistere, the stare of eons.

II - Songbird
-------------

language is a songbird. it suffuses the world with overlapping choruses of alien tongues. a symphony of location, of triangulating echoes, the smooth superposition of sound scapes the muses fuse into space. 

there is grammar in the noise.

the hiss of geese, hysterical and histrionic, coiling in serpentine necks. the straight edge of demarcation, the frantic flapping announcement of occupation. a screech that shears a circumference and clears the ground.

the quacking curiosity of dottering ducks, landing in fat splashes. the goofy cousins of geese hanging upside down like inverted buoys, their waggling feet kicking helpless with the overwhelming desire to plunge. the playful fingers of the flock, the rowdy laughter of the crowd. 

the rapid radar rhythm of circling sparrows, flickering fast in flight, their sudden movements coordinated in spastic weaves like weapons of war engaged in life-or-death combat. the dragnet signal of fleets traversing an ocean of sky, sentries in motion, a hive mind.

the mournful melodies of smitten thrush, their heartsick dirges lilting like pyres. the ever-flowing ashes of poetry on the wind. the melancholy that drifts in cooling embers, to blanket the earth in fertile white soot.

the lazy resigned cooing of pigeons waddling across the pavement. the exasperation of experience, the way musics dispels into sighs with age. the elegance of growing old and fading into oblivion, dissolving in white noise.

III - Game
----------

language is a game. it consists of moves and rules, of boards and pieces. each speaker becomes a tactician. each deployment serves a strategy. the formation becomes the function. the form becomes the content. 

| though rhyme accents the metaphor
|   discretion is advised.
| reserve the piece, it's better for
|   the ends that plans devised. 
|
| the flowing meter often heard 
| aligns precise in time with stress.
| the steady thrum of logic's pulse, 
| deduction hums in ordered flow.
| 
| power packs a different shape with
| forceful gusts of shouted words that
| stop the sentence cold for thought to
| ponder slow the spots that linger.
| 
| but just as easily whimsical,
| poetry carelessly galloping,
| valiantly posturing endlessly,
| effortless visual symphony. 
| 
| the way words weigh different in sequence.
| in sequence the different way words weigh.
| the different way words in sequence weigh.
| 
| the novel fluid in fluid novels. 
| the alternate interpretations that alternate. 
| each life lives in words a hundred different lives.
|
| the aibohphobia of semiordnilaps, 
| the parts that strap
| a spool of loops.
| on serif peels sleep fires, no? 
|
| an aim that hides a name
| a name that hides an aim
| the flow ingrained composes
| the flowing rain decomposes
|
| until all that remains
| is the pure image 
| of red as deep as blood
| and lines as straight as bone
| the skeletal structure
| that wears words like skin.

IV - Motion
-----------

language is motion. it is the pure movement of premise to consequence, of universal to particular. it never sleeps, it never stops, always becoming the next word, the next thought. The accumulation of words, sentences, paragraphs, like the way time piles up into days, weeks and months. ceaseless kinetic energy, boundless potential. the trajectory of narrative, the physics of story.

the seed. the sprout. the flower.

the interpretation is inescapable. the story moves through the words in stop-motion, the illusion of progression. causal logic is the primitive constraint all grammars must satisfy, the propellant that flings words through prescribed narrative arcs. the story is the pendulum that orders all things around its measured sway.

the boy. the call. the hero.

archetypes reign above the parts of speech like a linguistic pantheon of gods, the higher powers that pull the strings of syntax and make the puppet-thought dance in semantic pantomime. subatomic syllables yield to the tidal force of cosmic meaning. every story is a hologram, a volume encoded onto a surface, the projection of a shadow onto a cave wall. 

the garden. the fruit. the fall.

every story is the same story. every story is a different story. the implication is infinite. the set of all sets contains itself, forever exceeding the container it constructs for itself. the story is transcendent. infinity is an ellipsis.

every sentence that never ends starts with the phrase, "every sentence that never ends starts with the phrase, "every sentence that never ends start with the phrase...

V - Empire 
----------

language is empire. a dynasty that rules the realm of the mind by divine right. it is the limits of thought, the boundaries of the known world. its seat of power lies in decrees and edicts, the clauses of laws and the fine print of contracts. etymology is genealogy, the family tree of royalty, the pure bloodlines that converge and inaugurate history. 

language moves on horseback, delivered by the blades of swords and tips of arrows. a herald of invasion, the vanguard that charges headfirst into enemy lines. every war is won by words. the last traces of a people disappear with their language. the ground is a graveyard of the forgotten tongues of the conquered. every word is a soldier occupying a foreign land.

language is a latin mass, an immense cathedral of opulence, the obscene glow of gold. it cows with its complexity and affected air of mystery. 

language is cloak and dagger. it can neither confirm nor deny. it can only represent a state of affairs, possibly true, possibly false. it is the limited hang, the half truth, the sea of misinformation. it is crowd control, a hypnosis of repetition and response.

Bird 
----

| To say what's meant without the word,
| Oh poetry, relent wherein
| I yield to you all things deferred,
| In baptism, repent my sin.
|
| I found a bird, that sings so soft,
| Her song aloft in heart by choice.
| To field of hers I pass so oft
| To sit in grass and drink her voice.
|
| With chirping dive she plunged so deep
| And pierced the weary veil that hides
| The ghosts of dreams that haunt my sleep;
| She sang such hopeful lullabies.
|
| Oh bird, oh bird, with glee you sing,
| If you could know the depths of dark
| That shadows cast in offering,
| Would song still burst from breast in lark?

The Curse of Rain
-----------------

| The rainy days, so slandered, weep
| as haughty summer lovers lay
| and mock the sky with lazy sleep,
| while clouds so white with dreams of gray,
| with sun they soak and whirling sweep
| in hidden furies' winded spray.
|
| Each time it rains, the rivers splay,
| and surge with purging currents swift,
| what lays on shore is swept away
| through undertow then set adrift
| to reach again where edge gives way
| to core laid bare through ancient rift.
|
| The heat was shaped with holy bliss,
| while cold finds form in shattered fall,
| the tracks of arcs that never miss,
| the purpose found in roaring squall,
| to hurl in spite of stolen kiss,
| to seed with life this earthen sprawl.
|
| No forest sprite nor sun born sprout,
| can know the course of water's fate,
| to craft and make then cease the drought,
| and hear its name with venom hate
| in curses made by summer's clout,
| and so it cries at heaven's gate.

Let It Simmer
-------------

| A heart too hot will lack a taste
| refined. Quiet now, simmer down,
| and stew the sauce, or let it baste.
| Yes, let it sit, in flavor drown
| and only then when flame is off,
| you taste a bit, a smidgen pinch;
| Before your hunger dips to trough,
| begin to measure inch by inch
| what boiled over side of thought.
| Distilled to stock, the essence clean
| will cling in drops that drip on pot
| to add to future meals' cuisine.

|
| let dirge be purged through broken bell,
| through hollow dell with surging wind,
| unearthed remains returned from hell,
| the bones decayed now gardens tend.
|
| oh, name that hides in shattered ring,
| that brings the rain, becomes the night
| of lightless thunder, shriven sing
| the drops of dark through wicked flight.
|
| by dripping altar, prayers fled
| through clasping fingers splayed in maze.
| communing spirits past and dead
| before my eyes, their sightless gaze.
|
| deformed by time and bearing chains,
| with weeping ink of saint's remorse,
| the paint of statues leeched in stains,
| condemned to hear my voice grown hoarse.
|
| profane my soul and twist it loose
| with iron pincers red with sin.
| let drain my blood, my veins to sluice,
| replace my eyes and rise within.

Sight
-----

| the true nature 
| of sight 
| seen through closed eyes
| in dark 
| round rooms 
| with
| no corners to hang
| the 
| cloth of thought;
|
| endless flicker
| through
| inner pictures
| of 
| outer nothing
| met in perfect 
| equilibrium
| stabilized in secret
| through the muted
| dark. 
|
| then
|
| the flower sprouts 
| in acid eyes,
| through hidden struts
| the world supplies. 
|
| in flashing spiral
| the formless chaos
| of flailing chiral
| tentacles
| semantic suction cup
| receptacles
| frantic for their lack
|
| then 
| 
| black again
| without a rhyme
| just empty facts
|       (that flow through time...
|        a voice in back replies...)
| the hollow truth.

An Ode To Autumn
----------------

| Oh! If I could touch an inch of Autumn
|       And measure Fall in feet,
| I might scale its depths to chart the bottom
|       And feel the Winter heat.
| Alas, no meters mark by foot the path
|       Through wooded maze of trees
|           Where leaves like life will wilt
|               In winded wake of wrath
|           In gusts blown cruel and dumb
|        To lay at feet to span each foot
| The dust each clever leaf here does become.
|
| As seasons pass and cast
|       My bone layered into stone,
| Let August dig for me a grave in brown
|       Barrow beneath her loam.
| Pray not a lover find these shards on shore
|       I am no edge to skip
|           Atop the waves of fancy
|               But under weight sunk roar
|           Where, offset, tides will rise
|       To breach the sodden dike
| And drown with wave the lazing lovers' sigh.
|
| To life I came already old and grim
|           But now the chill sets in;
| Each breath in gasp dispels to steam
|           Of Spring now waning thin.

Imaginary Vessels
-----------------

| oh name of names, 
| break me into pieces.
| scatter me across these shores.
| let me linger in the tides,
| in the motion of the waves.
|
| the infinite horizon
| condenses into 
| licks of white foam
| on sparkling beaches.
| 
| shatter me into glass,
| slivered lunar shards.
| cast me into the deep
| to curve like lightning 
| across the geometry of the sea.
| 
| i am a million currents,
| the invisible riptide.
| every moment is an ebb
| within the flowing whole.
|  
| the cruel logic of time
| flows through the 
| phases of the moon.
| let me roar and hiss 
| through lightless nights
| as the tidal ages pass. 
| 
| though my bones are Earth,
| my blood was made from water
| and when my flesh is ground again,
| to the ocean i shall return.
|
| from nothing we are shaped;
| every image is a metaphor
| for the void inside.
| 
| our hearts are imaginary,
| like the shape of water
| that fills every vessel.

Song for the Demented
---------------------

| The lucky few who taste the hemlock blue!
| What fortune swings by neck from noose and nail!
| A minute gone their lives are bid adieu,
| Thus spared the withered touch that ages frail.
|
| For choicer cuts, then Time will stalk the mind
| In steady-stepping slow-revealed deceit,
| As hunters know to never scare the find,
| Unless the marbled fright infect the meat. 
|
| The body strung, then drained through veins of thought,
| precisely sliced at joints, the self is sluiced,
| its dripping threads, the wave of burning hot
| reserves of life, in air to steam reduced.

The Myth of Geese
-----------------

| the royal flock across the river banks
| in molting courts proclaim the summer theirs,
| its peasant fields now owned by inner ranks
| of scheming birds engaged in crude affairs.
| 
| a secret circle forms the noble core,
| the princelings graze, reposed on flowing knolls.
| as sentry towers hiss away the poor 
| and watch the ground in swiveled neck patrols.
| 
| they chase the beggars pecking fields for seed,
| these pegasi that charge with flightless wings,
| dominion boundless as their princelings' greed.
| the empire hunger breeds the feathered kings.
| 
| the heralds honk their liege with trumpet tongue 
| and sing the myth of geese to gosling young.

River Rats
----------

| On river shore the poor in tents will store
|    their nightly weeping sore.
| Above and north, the city steeples meet
| To speak in sermons ever incomplete
|     for sheep they so ignore.
|
| They fight with roar, yet beaten, kiss through gore;
| Their barrel fire northward dreams of more,
| The city lights too far a source of heat
|    For life on river shore.
|
| In winter months they paint on skin a whore,
| And every one despite what silence swore.
|     These cycles now repeat
|     While steeples chime upbeat.
| A yearly war for land they all abhor:
|     Their home on river shore.

One Misty Morn
--------------

| One misty morn of summer days
| when clouds collected futures sworn.
| From mountaintops descended haze
|       one misty morn.
| 
| That day a dress of green was worn
| while sky dissolved in liquid grays,
| I took your hand and we were born.
| 
| The sun reclaimed our world with rays,
| dispersed the fog, revealed a thorn.
| The fated prick dispelled the daze
|       one misty morn.

Forever
-------

| Let this moment last forever
| Let it sink not into never
| For all our plans so clever
| Let this moment last forever
| Hidden goal in each endeavor
| Lifted load of every lever
| Let this moment last forever
| Let it sink not into never.

Letters
-------

| She is nothing more than letters
| Under bedframe, wooden box.
| In her prison locked by fetters,
| She is nothing more than letters.
| Warrant wielded by her debtors
| Which vault of memory locks.
| She is nothing more than letters
| Under bedframe, wooden box.

Rails
-----

| i yearn for motion's pull and thrust
| the thunder pulse of engine churn
| 
| the pensive burn of ember coals
| i coax the sentry furnace west
| 
| i press the pure and tempered coke
| the poker tamps the pyre nest
| 
| the piled flame that prods the spokes
| i smoke through stops and tile plains
| 
| i'm riding tracks to mountaintops
| from ground to tip that cracks the sky
| 
| the circles arc around the trails
| i'm bound to rails that skirt my heart
