Electric Vehicle Distribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The United States Government General Services Administration maintains a huge database of public available information. One of the datasets they publish is the `Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing <https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data>`_

A random sample of 18 eletric vehicles was selected from this dataset and the *make* of the car was recorded. The resuls are given below,

    BMW, FORD, CHEVROLET, TESLA, FORD, BMW, VOLVO, TESLA, TESLA, NISSAN, CHEVROLET, BMW, TESLA, NISSAN, CHEVROLET, TESLA, TESLA, CHEVROLET

1. What is the population being sampled in this experiment?
   
2. Construct a relative frequency distribution and histogram for this sample of data. Label the axes. What is the most common (frequent) electric vehicle make in this sample of data?

3. Based on this sample, can we conclude your answer to #2 is the most common eletric vehicle make in the United States? Why or why not? 

.. note:: 

    We will come back and examine this dataset in :ref:`project-one`.

Twitter by Tweets and Followers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A research center conducted a national survey about teenage behavior. Teens were asked whether they had consumed a soft drink in the past week. The following table shows the counts for three independent random samples from major cities.

+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+
|       | Baltimore | Detroit | San Diego | Total |
+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+
| Yes   | 727       | 1,232   | 1,482     | 3,441 |
+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+
| No    | 177       | 431     | 798       | 1,406 |
+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+
| Total | 904       | 1,663   | 2,280     | 4,847 |
+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+

    a. Suppose one teen is randomly selected from each city's sample. A researcher claims that the likelihood of selecting a teen from Baltimore who consumed a soft drink in the past week is less than the likelihood of selecting a teen from either one of the other cities who consumed a soft drink in the past week because Baltimore has the least number of teens who consumed a soft drink. Is the researcher's claim correct? Explain your answer.

    b. Consider the values in the table. Construct a segmented bar chart of relative frequencies based on the information in the table. 
    
    c. Which city had the smallest proportion of teens who consumed a soft drink in the previous week? Determine the value of the proportion.

Product advertisers studied the effects of television ads on children's choices for two new snacks. The advertisers used two 30-second television ads in an experiment. One ad was for a new sugary snack called Choco-Zuties, and the other ad was for a new healthy snack called Apple-Zuties.

For the experiment, 75 children were randomly assigned to one of three groups, A, B, or C. Each child individually watched a 30-minute television program that was interrupted for 5 minutes of advertising. The advertising was the same for each group with the following exceptions.

- The advertising for group A included the Choco-Zuties ad but not the Apple-Zuties ad.
- The advertising for group B included the Apple-Zuties ad but not the Choco-Zuties ad.
- The advertising for group C included neither the Choco-Zuties ad nor the Apple-Zuties ad.

After the program, the children were offered a choice between the two snacks. The table below summarizes their choices.

The department of agriculture at a university was interested in determining whether a preservative was effective in reducing discoloration in frozen strawberries. A sample of 50 ripe strawberries was prepared for freezing. Then the sample was randomly divided into two groups of 25 strawberries each. Each strawberry was placed into a small plastic bag.

The 25 bags in the control group were sealed. The preservative was added to the 25 bags containing strawberries in the treatment group, and then those bags were sealed. All bags were stored at 0⬚C for a period of 6 months. At the end of this time, after the strawberries were thawed, a technician rated each strawberry's discoloration from 1 to 10, with a low score indicating little discoloration.

The dotplots below show the distributions of discoloration rating for the control and treatment groups.

To determine the amount of sugar in a typical serving of breakfast cereal, a student randomly selected 60 boxes of different types of cereal from the shelves of a large grocery store.

The student noticed that the side panels of some of the cereal boxes showed sugar content based on one-cup servings, while others showed sugar content based on three-quarter-cup servings. Many of the cereal boxes with side panels that showed three-quarter-cup servings were ones that appealed to young children, and the student wondered whether there might be some difference in the sugar content of the cereals that showed different-size servings on their side panels. To investigate the question, the data were separated into two groups. One group consisted of 29 cereals that showed one-cup serving sizes; the other group consisted of 31 cereals that showed three-quarter-cup serving sizes. The boxplots shown below display sugar content (in grams) per serving of the cereals for each of the two serving sizes.

Two box plots are shown using the same horizontal axis, which shows sugar content per serving in grams and is labeled from 0 to 22 in increments of 2. The bottom plot is for three quarters of a cup. The box extends from 8 to 12 with a vertical line at 10 dividing it into two regions. A horizontal line off the left of the box extends to 4 and a horizontal line off the right extends to 14. The top plot is for one cup. The box extends from 4 to 14 with a vertical line at 12 dividing it into two regions. A horizontal line off the left of the box extends to 0 and a horizontal line off the right extends to 20.

	a. Write a few sentences to compare the distributions of sugar content per serving for the two serving sizes of cereals.

After analyzing the boxplots on the preceding page, the student decided that instead of a comparison of sugar content per recommended serving, it might be more appropriate to compare sugar content for equal-size servings. To compare the amount of sugar in serving sizes of one cup each, the amount of sugar in each of the cereals showing three-quarter-cup servings on their side panels was multiplied by 4/3. The bottom boxplot shown below displays sugar content (in grams) per cup for those cereals that showed a serving size of three-quarter-cup on their side panels.

A horizontal line off the left of the box extends to 5 and a horizontal line off the right extends to 20. The top plot is for one cup. The box extends from 4 to 14 with a vertical line at 12 dividing it into two regions. A horizontal line off the left of the box extends to 0 and a horizontal line off the right extends to 20.

	b. What new information about sugar content do the boxplots above provide?

An experiment was conducted to study the effect of temperature on the reliability of an electronic device used in an undersea communications system. The experiment was done in a laboratory where tanks of seawater were maintained at either 10 C, 30 C, 50 C, or 70 C. After the electronic devices were submerged in the tanks for 5,000 hours, each device was inspected to determine if it was still working. The following table provides information on the number of devices tested at each temperature and the number of working devices at the end of the 5,000-hour test.

+----------------------+------+------+------+------+
| Seawater temperature | 10 C | 30 C | 50 C | 70 C |
+----------------------+------+------+------+------+
| # of working devices | 29   |  42  |  21  |  12  |
+----------------------+------+------+------+------+
| # of devices tested  | 30   |  50  |  30  |  20  |

Agricultural experts are trying to develop a bird deterrent to reduce costly damage to crops in the United States. An experiment is to be conducted using garlic oil to study its effectiveness as a nontoxic, environmentally safe bird repellant. The experiment will use European starlings, a bird species that causes considerable damage annually to the corn crop in the United States. Food granules made from corn are to be infused with garlic oil in each of five concentrations of garlic: 0 percent, 2 percent, 10 percent, 25 percent, and 50 percent. 

The researchers will determine the adverse reaction of the birds to the repellant by measuring the number of food granules consumed during a two-hour period following overnight food deprivation. There are forty birds available for the experiment, and the researchers will use eight birds for each concentration of garlic. Each bird will be kept in a separate cage and provided with the same number of food granules.

a. For the experiment, identify
	
	i. the treatments

	ii. the experimental units

	iii. the response that will be measured

The principal at Crest Middle School, which enrolls only sixth-grade students and seventh-grade students, is interested in determining how much time students at that school spend on homework each night. The table below shows the mean and standard deviation of the amount of time spent on homework each night (in minutes) for a random sample of 20 sixth-grade students and a separate random sample of 20 seventh-grade students at this school.

+------------------------+--------------+--------------------+
|                        |     Mean     | Standard Deviation |
+------------------------+--------------+--------------------+
| Sixth-grade students   |      27.3    |       10.8         |
+------------------------+--------------+--------------------+
| Seventh-grade students |      47.0    |       12.4         |
+------------------------+--------------+--------------------+

Based on dotplots of these data, it is not unreasonable to assume that the distribution of times for each grade were approximately normally distributed.

	a. Estimate the difference in mean times spent on homework for all sixth- and seventh-grade students in this school using an interval. Be sure to interpret your interval.

	b. An assistant principal reasoned that a much narrower confidence interval could be obtained if the students were paired based on their responses; for example, pairing the sixth-grade student and the seventh-grade student with the highest number of minutes spent on homework, the sixth-grade student and seventh-grade student with the next highest number of minutes spent on homework, and so on. Is the assistant principal correct in thinking that matching students in this way and then computing a matched-pairs confidence interval for the mean difference in time spent on homework is a better procedure than the one used in *part a* ? Explain why or why not.

One of the two fire stations in a certain town responds to calls in the northern half of the town, and the other fire station responds to calls in the southern half of the town. One of the town council members believes that the two fire stations have different mean response times. Response time is measured by the difference between the time an emergency call comes into the fire station and the time the first fire truck arrives at the scene of the fire.

Data were collected to investigate whether the council member's belief is correct. A random sample of 50 calls selected from the northern fire station had a mean response time of 4.3 minutes with a standard deviation of 3.7 minutes. A random sample of 50 calls selected from the southern fire station had a mean response time of 5.3 minutes with a standard deviation of 3.2 minutes.

	a. Construct and interpret a 95 percent confidence interval for the difference in mean response times between the two fire stations.

	b. Does the confidence interval in part (a) support the council member's belief that the two fire stations have different mean response times? Explain.

Patients with heart-attack symptoms arrive at an emergency room either by ambulance or self-transportation provided by themselves, family, or friends. When a patient arrives at the emergency room, the time of arrival is recorded. The time when the patient’s diagnostic treatment begins is also recorded.

An administrator of a large hospital wanted to determine whether the mean wait time (time between arrival and diagnostic treatment) for patients with heart-attack symptoms differs according to the mode of transportation. A random sample of 150 patients with heart-attack symptoms who had reported to the emergency room was selected. For each patient, the mode of transportation and wait time were recorded. Summary statistics for each mode of transportation are shown in the table below.

+------------------------+-------------+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| Mode of Transportation | Sample Size | Mean Wait Time (minutes) | Standard Deviation of Wait Time (minutes) |
+------------------------+-------------+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
|      Ambulance         |    77       |       6.04               |              4.30                         |

Use this information to solve the following problems.

	a. Use a 99 percent confidence interval to estimate the difference between the mean wait times for ambulance-transported patients and self-transported patients at this emergency room.

	b. Based only on this confidence interval, do you think the difference in the mean wait times is statistically significant? Justify your answer.

An environmental science teacher at a high school with a large population of students wanted to estimate the proportion of students at the school who regularly recycle plastic bottles. The teacher selected a random sample
of students at the school to survey. Each selected student went into the teacher's office, one at a time, and was asked to respond yes or no to the following question.

	Do you regularly recycle plastic bottles?

Based on the responses, a 95 percent confidence interval for the proportion of all students at the school who would respond yes to the question was calculated as :math:`(0.584, 0.816)`.

	a. How many students were in the sample selected by the environmental science teacher?

	b. Given the method used by the environmental science teacher to collect the responses, explain how bias might have been introduced and describe how the bias might affect the point estimate of the proportion of all students at the school who would respond yes to the question.

	c. The statistics teacher at the high school was concerned about the potential bias in the survey. To obtain a potentially less biased estimate of the proportion, the statistics teacher used an alternate method for collecting student responses. A random sample of 300 students was selected, and each student was given the following instructions on how to respond to the question.

		- In private, flip a fair coin.
		- If heads, you must respond no, regardless of whether you regularly recycle.
		- If tails, please truthfully respond yes or no.

		i. What is the expected number of students from the sample of 300 who would be required to respond no because the coin flip resulted in heads?

		ii. The results of the sample showed that 213 of the 300 selected students responded no. Based on the results of the sample, give a point estimate for the proportion of all students at the high school who would respond yes to the question.

The manager of a local fast-food restaurant is concerned about customers who ask for a water cup when placing an order but fill the cup with a soft drink from the beverage fountain instead of filling the cup with water. The manager selected a random sample of 80 customers who asked for a water cup when placing an order and found that 23 of those customers filled the cup with a soft drink from the beverage fountain.

	a. Construct and interpret a 95 percent confidence interval for the proportion of all customers who, having asked for a water cup when placing an order, will fill the cup with a soft drink from the beverage fountain.

	b. The manager estimates that each customer who asks for a water cup but fills it with a soft drink costs the restaurant $0.25. Suppose that in the month of June 3,000 customers ask for a water cup when placing an order. Use the confidence interval constructed in part (a) to give an interval estimate for the cost to the restaurant for the month of June from the customers who ask for a water cup but fill the cup with a soft drink.
