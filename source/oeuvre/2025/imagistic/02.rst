Millenia
--------


| the slow motion of lives in the forest depths,
|
| empires of pine wage ancient wars against city-states of oak.
| an insurgency of maple hides in their midst, gathers at their trunks,
| a nascent rebellion that unwinds over centuries.
|
| morning dew soaks the slick bark of the frozen sentinels
| and paints with strokes, measured in years, the green of pungent mold spores.
| 
| here, a pile of stones older than humanity, hewn from a mountain,.
| the jagged edges of its primordial eruption softened by quiet eons,
| now draped with pagan cloaks of forest magic,
| the altars of secret divinations,
| pooling with the blood of moss.
| 
| the harmonic revolutions of parallel life,
| the millennial melodies converging into a chorus of now.
