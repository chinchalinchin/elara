Snowflake Obsidian
------------------

| a tiny sphere of speckled grey
| once lurked in secret on a shelf
| 
| behind a tarot card display
| when sudden struck, it hurled itself
| 
| from silent birth in cradled heat
| through glowing veins of salted dirt,
| 
| where liquid black condensed complete
| before a bloom distilled a skirt
|
| of flowing fire's grey debris,
| encased in glass it lingers still,
|
| as crashing down its way to me
| it rolled to stop with hidden skill
|
| and waited longer under bed 
| until i gave to you its thread.
