Islands
-------

| my mind is made and multiplied
| divided fine to override
| the silent times i sit and sigh,
| as diving deep, the tides arise,
| with violence sweep the thoughts aside
| to hidden keeps on coastal lines 
| where finer things reside on ice
| like island wines we sipped with eyes
| in sight of shores inclined to skies
| before the final wave decides
| these idle highs remain outside
| while I am here, inside the lies.
