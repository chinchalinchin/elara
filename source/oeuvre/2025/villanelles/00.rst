Cathedral

| A church atop a steepled hill,
| foundation layers ages old,
| remains in spirit standing still.
| 
| The shattered stains on window sill,
| with marble halls of lichen mold,
| a church atop a steepled hill.
|
| Decrepit pews of souls fulfill
| what congregation left untold,
| remains in spirit standing still.
|
| The circled streets possess no will
| except the signs that staked and sold
| a church atop a steepled hill.
|
| But tower high such pointed skill,
| through silken skies of glittered gold,
| remains in spirit standing still.
|
| Ignore the wind, the biting chill,
| and cast your final gaze, behold:
| A church atop a steepled hill 
| remains in spirit standing still.

.. epigraph::

  Hi Grant,

  Thank you for sending Landscapes/Cathedral/Ode to Death/Eulogy to SKUMMEL. Your piece stayed with us, haunting the room in the best way. While we decided not to accept it this time, it came close. We kept returning to it during our final reads. If you know what a personal rejection is, this is that.

  We’d love to see more from you in the future. Consider this an open invitation to send us your next work.

  Our pages are shaped by the voices that linger. Yours is one we hope will return.

  -- The Editors, SKUMMEL
