Roses
-----

| a twisted heart of roses falls apart;
| the petals flake in spirals round the vase.
| 
| reflected in my iris counterpart,
| the radii that trail in thoughts retrace
| 
| their fallen arcs reversed in surging climb,
| returned in course to blooms unplucked by hand
| 
| where threaded thorns are wreathed with sage and thyme.
| unfolding flowers thick with youth expand,
| 
| a nubile blossom stained in bloody red,
| then sliced precisely where its life begins,
|
| a bed of loam exchanged for glass instead.
| suspended lifeless color drains and thins.
|
| i measure days in wilted leaves that drop,
| bouquets of clocks awaiting death to stop
