| Where winter breaks across the bow of ships,
| the cold ascends in empires drawn from ice.
| The mist dissolves to steam escaping lips
| while warmer thoughts are mourned in sacrifice.

| The cold ascends in empires drawn from ice
| as wind returns a harbour street to sleet,
| while warmer thoughts are mourned in sacrifice,
| his letters worn with lines I can't repeat.

| As wind returns a harbour street to sleet,
| I think upon the sailor lost at sea,
| his letters worn with lines I can't repeat,
| the words he said in promises to me.
