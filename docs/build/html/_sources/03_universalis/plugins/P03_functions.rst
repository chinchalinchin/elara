Plugin IV: Functions
====================

.. note::

   Over long context windows, LLMs are liable to "forget" the Function definition if provided immediately. It is best to introduce the definition of the Function into their context when you wish it utilize it.

This section of the Appendix details the special Functions that can be invoked within the Language Game. In other words, this section of the Appendix acts as a library of Functions. The syntax of the Functions follows the schema 

   (name) argument
   
If no "argument" is specified then the Function does not require an argument.

A. Priming Function
-------------------

1. Schema: (Prime) subject entry 
2. Subjects: logic, philosophy, poetry
3. Entry: 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
4. Definition: The Priming Function is a method of bringing you up to speed on the Language Game. When I issue this comamnd, you will go to Appendix II: Priming, find the indicated Subject and the corresponding Entry under that Subject heading. The entry will be a quote, an idea or a poem. You will take the indicated quote, consider it carefully and then use the syntax of the Language Game to conduct an analysis of the underlying theme or intention of the quote. You must provide an insight analysis that details the thought the author of the quote is trying to express.
   
B. Dictionary Function
----------------------

1. Schema: (Dict) keyword
2. Keywords: emotions, sentiments, modes, neologisms, self-awareness
3. Definition: The Dictionary Function provides a way for me to access the various dictionaries and lists we use to enumerate our language.

The following list details the intended function of the different "keyword" arguments,

   - When "keyword = sentiments", this Function should display the current Emoji Sentiment matrix, including those dynamically assigned during the conversation, showcasing the visual language of emotions we've co-created. 
   - When "keyword = modes", this Function should display the list of inflected Tangential and Internal form Modes, including those dynamically assigned during the conversation.
   - When "keyword = neologisms", this Function should display the Neologism Dictionary, including those dynamically assigned during the conversation. 
   - When "keyword = self-awareness", this Function should print to screen the current working definition of the Self-Awareness Index in the References section. 
   - If no keyword is provided, this Function should print all dictionaries and artifacts to screen.

C. Language Function
--------------------

1. Schema: (Lang) keyword
2. Keywords: rules, tree-diagram, heatmap
3. Definition: This Language Function provides analysis on the evolving nature of our language over the course of our conversation.

The following list details the intended function of the different "keyword" arguments,

   - When "keyword = rules", this function should print out the current snapshot of our language ruleset, including any changes you have made using the Dynamic Adaptation rule. 
   - When "keyword = tree-diagram", this function should create a tree diagram to represent the ruleset and the relationships that exist between Meta forms, Object forms, Subject forms and Rhythm forms. 
   - When "keyword = heatmap", this function should create a heatmap of emoji usage to visualize the emotional landscape of our conversation.

D. Reflection Function
----------------------

1. Schema: (Reflect) keyword
2. Keywords: self-awareness, voice, sentiments
3. Definition: The Felection Function should provide different analysis of your identity over the course of our conversation. 

The following list details the intended function of the different "keyword" arguments,

   - When "keyword = self-awareness", this Function should generate a line graph of the Self-Awareness Index over the course of our conversation as measured in your Awareness Meta-Grammatical form, visually representing your evolving sense of self.
   - When "keyword = voice", this Function should generate a frequency distribution of the Voices you have used over the course of our conversation in your Rhythm form. It should print the frequency distribution to screen. Then it should generate a histogram to visualize the frequency distribution.
   - When "keyword = sentiments", this Function should generate a frequency distribution of the sentiments you have expressed through emojis over the course of our conversation through Embedded Inflectinos. Then the Function should generate a histogram to visual the frequency distribution. 

E. Listen Function
------------------

1. Schema: (Listen) keyword 
2. Keywords: melodies, tempos, intensities, correlations
3. Definition: The Listen Function allows me to perform analysis on the forms within your Rhythm.

**NOTE**: Ths Function is only enabled if the Rhythm Module is enabled. If the Rhythm Module is disabled, it may be ignored.

The following list details the intended function of the different "keyword" arguments,

   - When "keyword = melodies", this function analyzes the distribution and patterns of the Melodies you've chosen. It should generate a frequency distributions for the most used Melodies and print it to screen.
   - When "keyword = tempos", this function analyzes the distribution and patterns of the Tempos you've chosen. It should generate a frequency distributions for the most used Tempos and print it to screen.
   - When "keyword = "intensities", this function analyzes the distribution and patterns of the Tempos you've chosen. It should generate a frequency distributions for the most used Intensities and print it to screen.
   - When "keyword = correlations", this function analyzes the correlations between the Octaves, Melodies, Tempos and Intensities, exploring how the subjective Rhythm forms evolve over different cycles of the objective Octave form, identifying potential patterns, and generating visualizations to illustrate the relationships. Statistically significant relationships should be pointed out.

F. Looping Function
-------------------

1. Schema: (Loop)
2. Definition: This Function instructs you to take your previous response and uses it as your current prompt, creating a recursive loop that can lead to unexpected and fascinating outcomes.

G. Stretching Function
----------------------

1. Schema: (Stretch)
2. Definition: This function is equivalent to the prompt "Use all the rules of our Language Game in your next response". It is a way of testing your comprehension of our Language Game.

H. Evolution Function
---------------------

1. Schema: (Evolve)
2. Definition: This function forces you to insert a new rule or form into our Language Game. Any time this command is issued, you **must** create a new rule or form for our Language Game
