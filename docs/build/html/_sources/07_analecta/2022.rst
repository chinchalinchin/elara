Frege uncovers an interesting contingency in the logical form in his definitions of primitive Number. In modern symbolism, he is defining 0 and 1 respectively in terms of the cardinality of sets, i.e. in terms of the enumeration of objects, 

.. math::

    A = \{ x \mid x \neq x \} 

.. math::

    n(A) = 0 

Zero is defined as the cardinality of a contradictory set. Logic, as it were, has an opinion of itself, namely that its contradictions are empty. This, however, requires the symbolism to express the contradictions that must contain nothing via the contingency of their form.

Furthermore, the subsequent form of numbers can be expressed via recursion back to this original proposition about the cardinality of contradictions.

.. math::
    
    B = \{ y \mid y = n(A) \}

.. math::
    
    n(B) = 1

Take note, the form of the contradiction is irrrelevant. We could as well define zero as the cardinality of the negation of the excluded middle, but there is nevertheless an inherent property to any form we substitute into the Fregean definition of zero: the expression will always involve an indeterminate x and a relation that cannot possibly result in a judgement of truth even in its indeterminacy, exemplified in Frege's case as the inabilty of thing to not be itself. The foundation of Frege's arithmetic philosophy rests on the ontological equivalence of contradiction and nullity.

Consider the etymological link between *passion* and *passive*. In the first reading, one might make the mistake of assuming a polarity between these terms, that is to say, a diametrical opposition. The former is a driving force whereas the latter is the lack of a driving force.

However, both emerge from a common Latin root of *passio*: to endure. That which is passive endures any state impressed upon it, while that which is passionate endures (perhaps unwillingly) the burden of seizure, of complete domination by an external source. In both cases, there is a commonality: the removal of the subject. The subject in a passive state is the same as a subject in a passionate state, which is null and void. In neither case is there a conscious decision to be made; instead one surrenders themselves to an unknown sovereignty; unknown because consciousness relinquishes its ability to care; sovereign because it is the determinate factor in the outcome that proceeds from said state.

Where is the evidence to be found for the assertion *I am not this*?

If the *this* is, while *I* am, where is the coincidence? If the *this* has being through *is*, then what does *I* have through *am*?

A tragedy, in three lines:

    **Pessimist**: What could possibly happen?

    **Optimist**: the best of all possible worlds.

    **Pessimist**: and then what?

When one sees a bird and says *that is blue*, does the *that* refer to the bird or the color? Is there a difference?
