Sonnet 64, 1609
---------------

    | When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd
    | The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;
    | When sometime lofty towers I see down-ras'd
    | And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
    | When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
    | Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
    | And the firm soil win of the wat'ry main,
    | Increasing store with loss and loss with store;
    | When I have seen such interchange of state,
    | Or state itself confounded to decay;
    | Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,
    | That Time will come and take my love away.
    | This thought is as a death, which cannot choose
    | But weep to have that which it fears to lose.

.. _hymn-to-god-my-god-in-sickness:

Hymn To God, My God, In Sickness, 1623
--------------------------------------

    | Since I am coming to that holy room,
    |    Where, with thy choir of saints for evermore,
    | I shall be made thy music; as I come
    |    I tune the instrument here at the door,
    |    And what I must do then, think here before.
    |
    | Whilst my physicians by their love are grown
    |    Cosmographers, and I their map, who lie
    | Flat on this bed, that by them may be shown
    |    That this is my south-west discovery,
    | *Per fretum febris*, by these straits to die,
    |
    | I joy, that in these straits I see my west;
    |   For, though their currents yield return to none,
    | What shall my west hurt me? As west and east
    |   In all flat maps (and I am one) are one,
    |   So death doth touch the resurrection.
    |
    | Is the Pacific Sea my home? Or are
    |   The eastern riches? Is Jerusalem?
    | Anyan, and Magellan, and Gibraltar,
    |   All straits, and none but straits, are ways to them,
    |   Whether where Japhet dwelt, or Cham, or Shem.
    |
    | We think that Paradise and Calvary,
    |   Christ's cross, and Adam's tree, stood in one place;
    | Look, Lord, and find both Adams met in me;
    |   As the first Adam's sweat surrounds my face,
    |   May the last Adam's blood my soul embrace.
    |
    | So, in his purple wrapp'd, receive me, Lord;
    |   By these his thorns, give me his other crown;
    | And as to others' souls I preach'd thy word,
    |   Be this my text, my sermon to mine own:
    | "Therefore that he may raise, the Lord throws down."

.. _essay-on-man:

Essay on Man, 1733
------------------

    | Awake, my St. John! Leave all meaner things
    | To low ambition, and the pride of Kings,
    | Let us (since Life can little more supply
    | Than just to look about us and to die)
    | Expatiate free o'er all this scene of Man;
    | A mighty maze! But not without a plan;
    | A Wild, where weeds and flow'rs promiscuous shoot;
    | Or Garden, tempting with forbidden fruit.
    | Together, let us beat this ample field,
    | Try what the open, what the covert yields?
    | The latent tracts, the giddy heights, explore
    | Of all who blindly creep, or sightless soar;
    | Eye Nature's walks, shoot Folly as it flies,
    | And catch the Manners living as they rise;
    | Laugh where we must, be candid where we can;
    | But vindicate the ways of God to Man.
    |   Say first, of God above, or Man below, 
    | What can we reason, but from what we know? 
    | Of Man, what see we but his station here,
    | From which to reason, or to which refer? 
    | Thro' worlds unnumber'd tho' the God be known,
    | 'Tis ours to trace him only in our own.
    | He, who thro' vast immensity can pierce, 
    | See worlds on worlds compose one universe;
    | Observe how system into system runs,
    | What other planets circle other suns, 
    | What vary'd Being peoples ev'ry star, 
    | May tell why Heav'n has made us as we are. 
    | But of this frame the bearings, and the ties, 
    | The strong connexions, nice dependencies,
    | Gradations just, has they pervading soul
    | Look'd thro'? Or can a part contain the whole?
    |   Is the great chain, that draws all to agree, 
    | And drawn supports, upheld by God, or thee?

.. _ode-to-a-nightingale:

Ode to a Nightingale, 1819
--------------------------

    | My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains
    |    My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,
    | Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
    |    One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:
    | 'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,
    |   But being too happy in thine happiness,—
    |       That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees
    |                   In some melodious plot
    |   Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,
    |       Singest of summer in full-throated ease.
    | 
    | O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been
    |   Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth,
    | Tasting of Flora and the country green,
    |   Dance, and Provençal song, and sunburnt mirth!
    | O for a beaker full of the warm South,
    |   Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,
    |       With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,
    |           And purple-stained mouth;
    |   That I might drink, and leave the world unseen,
    |       And with thee fade away into the forest dim:
    |
    | Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget
    |   What thou among the leaves hast never known,
    | The weariness, the fever, and the fret
    |   Here, where men sit and hear each other groan;
    | Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs,
    |   Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;
    |       Where but to think is to be full of sorrow
    |           And leaden-eyed despairs,
    |   Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,
    |       Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.
    |
    | Away! away! for I will fly to thee,
    |   Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,
    | But on the viewless wings of Poesy,
    |   Though the dull brain perplexes and retards:
    | Already with thee! tender is the night,
    |   And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,
    |       Cluster'd around by all her starry Fays;
    |           But here there is no light,
    |   Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown
    |       Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.
    |
    | I cannot see what flowers are at my feet,
    |   Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,
    | But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet
    |   Wherewith the seasonable month endows
    | The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild;
    |   White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine;
    |       Fast fading violets cover'd up in leaves;
    |           And mid-May's eldest child,
    |   The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine,
    |       The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.
    |
    | Darkling I listen; and, for many a time
    |   I have been half in love with easeful Death,
    | Call'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme,
    |   To take into the air my quiet breath;
    |       Now more than ever seems it rich to die,
    |   To cease upon the midnight with no pain,
    |       While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad
    |           In such an ecstasy!
    |   Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain—
    |           To thy high requiem become a sod.
    |
    | Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!
    |   No hungry generations tread thee down;
    | The voice I hear this passing night was heard
    |   In ancient days by emperor and clown:
    | Perhaps the self-same song that found a path
    |   Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,
    |       She stood in tears amid the alien corn;
    |           The same that oft-times hath
    |   Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam
    |       Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.
    |
    | Forlorn! the very word is like a bell
    |   To toll me back from thee to my sole self!
    | Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well
    |   As she is fam'd to do, deceiving elf.
    | Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades
    |   Past the near meadows, over the still stream,
    |       Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep
    |           In the next valley-glades:
    |   Was it a vision, or a waking dream?
    |       Fled is that music:—Do I wake or sleep?

Spring and Fall, 1918 
---------------------

    | Margaret, are you grieving
    | Over Goldengrove unleaving?
    | Leaves like the things of man, you
    | With your fresh thoughts care for, can you?
    | Ah! As the the heart grows older
    | It will come to such sights colder
    | By and by, nor spare a sigh
    | Though worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie;
    | And yet you will weep and know why.
    | Now no matter, child, the name:
    | Sorrow's springs are the same.
    | Nor mouth had, no nor mind, expressed
    | What heart heard of, ghost guessed:
    | It is the blight man was born for,
    | It is Margaret you mourn for.

    |
    | All all and all the dry worlds lever,
    | Stage of the ice, the solid ocean, 
    | All from the oil, the pound of lava. 
    | City of spring, the governed flower, 
    | Turns in the earth that turns the ashen
    | Towns around on a wheel of fire. 
    |
    | How now my flesh, my naked fellow, 
    | Dug of the sea, the glanded morrow, 
    | Worm in the scalp, the staked and fallow.
    | All all and all, the corpse's lover,
    | Skinny as sin, the foaming marrow, 
    | All of the flesh, the dry worlds lever.

    |
    | Fear not the waking world, my mortal, 
    | Fear not the flat, synthetic blood,
    | Nor the heart in the ribbing metal. 
    | Fear not the tread, the seeded milling, 
    | The trigger and scythe, the bridal blade, 
    | Nor the flint in the lover's mauling.
    |
    | Man of my flesh, the jawbone riven, 
    | Know now the flesh's lock and vice,
    | And the cage for the scythe-eyed raver. 
    | Know, O my bone, the jointed lever, 
    | Fear not the screws that turn the voice 
    | And the face to the driven lover. 
    |

    | 
    | All all and all the dry worlds couple,
    | Ghost with her ghost, contagious man
    | With the womb of his shapeless people. 
    | All that shapes from the caul and suckle,
    | Stroke of mechanical flesh on mine, 
    | Square in these worlds the mortal circle. 
    | 
    | Flower, flower, the people's fusion,
    | O light in zenith, the coupled bud, 
    | And the flame in the flesh's vision.
    | Out of the sea, the drive of oil,
    | Socket and grave, the brassy blood, 
    | Flower, flower, all all and all.

.. _little-gidding-v:

Little Gidding V, 1942 
----------------------

    | What we call the beginning is often the end
    | And to make and end is to make a beginning.
    | The end is where we start from. And every phrase
    | And sentence that is right (where every word is at home,
    | Taking its place to support the others,
    | The word neither diffident nor ostentatious,
    | An easy commerce of the old and the new,
    | The common word exact without vulgarity,
    | The formal word precise but not pedantic,
    | The complete consort dancing together)
    | Every phrase and every sentence is an end and a beginning,
    | Every poem an epitaph. And any action
    | Is a step to the block, to the fire, down the sea's throat
    | Or to an illegible stone: and that is where we start.
    | We die with the dying:
    | See, they depart, and we go with them.
    | We are born with the dead:
    | See, they return, and bring us with them.
    | The moment of the rose and the moment of the yew-tree
    | Are of equal duration. A people without history
    | Is not redeemed from time, for history is a pattern
    | Of timeless moments. So, while the light fails
    | On a winter's afternoon, in a secluded chapel
    | History is now and England.
    |
    | With the drawing of this Love and the voice of this Calling
    |
    | We shall not cease from exploration
    | And the end of all our exploring
    | Will be to arrive where we started
    | And know the place for the first time.
    | When the last of earth left to discover
    | Is that which was the beginning;
    | At the source of the longest river
    | The voice of the hidden waterfall
    | And the children in the apple-tree
    |
    | Not known, because not looked for
    | But heard, half-heard, in the stillness
    | Between two waves of the sea.
    | Quick now, here, now, always--
    | A condition of complete simplicity
    | (Costing not less than everything)
    | And all shall be well and
    | All manner of thing shall be well
    | When the tongues of flames are in-folded
    | Into the crowned knot of fire
    | And the fire and the rose are one

I Met A Genius, 1992

    | I met a genius on the train

    | about 6 years old,

    | and as the train
    | ran down along the coast
    | we came to the ocean
    | and then he looked at me
    | and said,
    | it's not pretty.
