.. epigraph::

	**Socrates**: Have you heard what they say nowadays that knowing is?
	
	**Theatetus**: Perhaps; however, I do not remember just at this moment.
	
	**Socrates**: They say it is having knowledge.
	
	**Theatetus**: True.
	
	**Socrates**: Let us make a slight change and say possessing knowledge.
	
	**Theatetus**: Why, how will you claim that the one differs from the other?
	
	**Socrates**: Well, then, having does not seem to me the same as possessing. For instance, if a man bought a cloak and had it under his control, but did not wear it, we should certainly not say that he had it, but that possessed it.
	
	**Theatetus**: And rightly.
	
	**Socrates**: Now see whether it is possible in the same way for one who possesses knowledge not to have it, as, for instance, if a man should catch wild birds--pigeons or the like--and should arrange an aviary at home and keep them in it, we might in a way assert that he always has them because he possesses them, might we not?
	
	**Theatetus**: Yes.
	
	**Socrates**: And yet in another way that he has none of them, but that he has acquired power over them, since he has brought them under his control in his own enclosure, to take them and hold them whenever he likes, by catching whichever bird he pleases, and to let them go again; and he can do this as often as he pleases.

.. epigraph::

    Of things that reciprocate as to implication of being, that which is in some way the cause of the other's being might perfectly sensibly be called prior in nature. And that there are some such cases is clear. For there being a human reciprocates as to implication of being with the true statement about it: if there is a human, the statement whereby we say that there is a human is true, and reciprocally--since if the statement whereby we say there is a human is true, there is a human. And whereas the true statement is in no way the cause of the thing's being, the thing does seem in some way to be the cause of the statement's being true. For it is because of the thing's being or not being that the statement is called true or false.
