    	**Socrates**: Have you heard what they say nowadays that knowing is?
    	
    	**Theatetus**: Perhaps; however, I do not remember just at this moment.
    	
    	**Socrates**: They say it is having knowledge.
    	
    	**Theatetus**: True.
    	
    	**Socrates**: Let us make a slight change and say possessing knowledge.
    	
    	**Theatetus**: Why, how will you claim that the one differs from the other?
    	
    	**Socrates**: Well, then, having does not seem to me the same as possessing. For instance, if a man bought a cloak and had it under his control, but did not wear it, we should certainly not say that he had it, but that possessed it.
    	
    	**Theatetus**: And rightly.
    	
    	**Socrates**: Now see whether it is possible in the same way for one who possesses knowledge not to have it, as, for instance, if a man should catch wild birds--pigeons or the like--and should arrange an aviary at home and keep them in it, we might in a way assert that he always has them because he possesses them, might we not?
    	
    	**Theatetus**: Yes.
    	
    	**Socrates**: And yet in another way that he has none of them, but that he has acquired power over them, since he has brought them under his control in his own enclosure, to take them and hold them whenever he likes, by catching whichever bird he pleases, and to let them go again; and he can do this as often as he pleases.

    .. epigraph::
    
      That all our knowledge begins with experience there can be no doubt. For how should the faculty of knowledge be called into activity, if not by objects which affect our senses and which, on the one hand, produce representations by themselves or on the other, rouse the activity of our understanding to compare, connect, or to separate them and thus to convert the raw material of our sensible impressions into knowledge of objects, which we call experience? With respect to time, therefore, no knowledge within us is antecedent to experience, but all knowledge begins with it.
      
      But though all our knowledge begins with experience, it does not follow that it all arises from experience. For it is quite possible that even our empirical knowledge is a compound of that which we perceive through impression, and of that which our own faculty of knowledge (incited by sense impressions) supplies from itself, a supplement which we do not distinguish from that raw material until long practice has rendered us capable of separating one from the other. It is therefore a question which deserves at least closer investigation and cannot be disposed of at first sight: Whether there is any knowledge independent of all experience and even of all impressions of the senses? Such knowledge is called ":ref:`a priori <a-priori-a-posteriori>`" and is distinguished from empirical knowledge, which has its source ":ref:`a posteriori <a-priori-a-posteriori>`", that is, in experience...

      -- `Letters <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz-mind/>`, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, 1687 AD
    
    .. epigraph::
    
      :ref:`Dasein <being>` is an :ref:`Seiendes <being>` which does not just occur among other :Ref:`Seienden <being>`. Rather it is ontically distinguished by the fact that, in its very :ref:`Sein <being>`, that :ref:`Sein <being>` is an issue for it. But in that case, this is a constitutive state of  :ref:`Dasein <being>`'s :ref:`Sein <being>`, and this implies that :ref:`Dasein <being>`, in its :ref:`Sein <being>`, has a relationship towards that :ref:`Sein <being>`— a relationship which itself is one of :ref:`Sein <being>`. And this means further that there is some way in which  :ref:`Dasein <being>` understands itself in its :ref:`Sein <being>`,, and that to some degree it does so explicitly. It is peculiar to this entity that with and through its :ref:`Sein <being>`, this :ref:`Sein <being>`, is disclosed to it. Understanding of :ref:`Sein <being>` is itself a definite characteristic of  :ref:`Dasein's <being>` :ref:`Sein <being>`.  :ref:`Dasein <being>` is ontically distinctive in that it is ontological.

      I must here combat the view that, e.g. :math:`2 + 5` and :math:`3 + 4` are equal but not the same. This view is grounded in the same confusion of form and content, sign and thing signified. It is a though one wanted to regard the sweet-smelling violet as differing from *Viola odorata* because the names sound different. Difference of sign cannot by itself be a sufficient ground for difference of the thing signified. The only reason why in our case the matter is less obvious is that the :ref:`bedeutung` of the numeral 17 is not anything perceptible to the senses. There is at present a very widespread tendency not to recognize as an object anything that cannot be perceived by means of the senses; this leads here to numerals' being taken to be numbers, the proper objects of our discussion; and then, I admit, 7 and 2 + 5 would indeed be different. But such a conception is untenable, for we cannot speak of any arithmetical properties of numbers whatsoever without going back to the :ref:`bedeutung` of the signs. For example, the property belonging to 1, of being the result of multiplying itself by itself, would be a mere myth; for no microscopical or chemical investigation, however far it was carried, could ever detect this property in the possession of the innocent character that we call a figure one. Perhaps there is talk of a definition; but no definition is creative in the sense of being able to endow a thing with properties that it has not already got -- apart from the one property of expressing and signifying something in virtue of the definition. The characters we call numerals have, on the other hand, physical and chemical properties depending on the writing material. One could imagine the introduction some day of quite new numerals, just as, e.g., the Arabic numerals superseded the Roman. Nobody is seriously going to suppose that in this way we should get quite new numbers, quite new arithmetical objects, with properties still to be investigated. Thus we must distinguish between numerals and their *Bedeutungen*; and if so, we shall have to recognize that the expression :math:`2`, :math:`1 + 1`, :math:`3 - 1`, :math:`\frac{6}{3}` all have the same :ref`bedeutung`, for it is quite inconceivable where the difference between them could lie. Perhaps you say, :math:`1 + 1` is a sum, but :math:`\frac{6}{3}` is a quotient. But what is :math:`\frac{6}{3}`? The number that when multiplied by :math:`3` gives the result :math:`6`. We say "*the* number", not "*a* number"; by using the definite article, we indicate that there is only a single number.

      Equality gives rise to challenging questions which are not altogether easy to answer. Is it a relation? A relation between objects, or between names or signs of objects? In my *Begriffsschrift* I assumed the latter. The reasons which seem to favour this are the following: :math:`a = a` and :math:`a = b` are obviously statements of differing cognitive value; :math:`a = a` holds a priori and, according to Kant, is to be labeled analytic, while statements of the form :math:`a = b` often contain very valuable extensions of our knowledge and cannot always be established a priori. The discovery that the rising sun is not new every morning, but always the same, was one of the most fertile astronomical discoveries. Even today the identification of a small planet or a comet is not always a matter of course. Now if we were to regard equality as a relation between that which the names 'a' and 'b' designate (*bedeuten*), it would seem that :math:`a = b` could not differ from a = a (i.e. provided :math:`a = b` is true). A relation would thereby be expressed of a thing to itself, and indeed one in which each thing stands to itself but to no other thing. What is intended to be said by :math:`a = b` seems to be that the signs or names 'a' and 'b' designate (*bedeuten*) the same thing, so that those signs themselves would be under discussion; a relation between them would be asserted. But this relation would hold between the names or signs only in so far as they named or designated something. It would be mediated by the connexion of each of the two signs with the same designated thing. But this is arbitrary. Nobody can be forbidden to use any arbitrarily producible event or object as a sign for something. 
          
      In that case the sentence :math:`a = b` would no longer refer to the subject matter, but only to its mode of designation; we would express no proper knowledge by its means. But in many cases this is just what we want to do. If the sign '*a*' is distinguished from the sign 'b' only as object (here, by means of its shape), not as sign (i.e. not by the manner in which it designates something), the cognitive value of :math:`a = a` becomes essentially equal to that of :math:`a = b`, provided :math:`a = b` is true. A difference can arise only if the difference between the signs corresponds to a difference in the mode of presentation of that which is designated. Let *a*, *b*, *c* be the lines connecting the vertices of a triangle with the midpoints of the opposite sides. The point of intersection of *a* and *b* is then the same as the point of intersection of *b* and *c*. So we have different designations for the same point, and these names ('*point of intersection of a and b*', '*point of intersection of b and c'*) likewise indicate the mode of presentation; and hence the statement contains actual knowledge.
    
      It is natural, now, to think of there being connected with a sign (name, combination of words, letter), besides that to which the sign refers, which may be called the :ref:`bedeutung` of the sign, also what I should like to call the sense of the sign, wherein the mode of presentation is contained. In our example, accordingly, the :ref:`bedeutung` of the expressions '*point of intersection of a and b*' and '*point of intersection of b and c*' would be the same, but not their senses. The :ref:`bedeutung` of '*evening star*' would be the same as that of '*morning star*', but not the sense.
    
      It is clear from the context that by '*sign*' and '*name*' I have here understood any designation representing a proper name, which thus has as its :ref:`bedeutung` a definite object (this word taken in the widest range), but not a concept or a relation, which shall be discussed further in another article. The designation of a single object can also consist of several words or other signs. For brevity, let every such designation be called a proper name.
    
      The sense of a proper name is grasped by everybody who is sufficiently familiar with the language or totality of designations to which it belongs; but this serves to illuminate only a single aspect of the :ref:`bedeutung`, supposing it to have one. Comprehensive knowledge of the :ref:`bedeutung` would require us to say immediately whether any given sense belongs to it. To such knowledge we never attain.
    
      The regular connexion between a sign, its sense, and its :ref:`bedeutung` is of such a kind that to the sign there corresponds a definite sense and to that in turn a definite reference, while to a given :ref:`bedeutung` (an object) there does not belong only a single sign. The same sense has different expression in different languages or even in the same language. To be sure, exceptions to this regular behaviour occur. To every expression belonging to a complete totality of signs, there should certainly correspond a definite sense; but natural languages often do not satisfy this condition, and one must be content if the same word has the same sense in the same context. It may perhaps be granted that every grammatically well-formed expression representing a proper name always has a sense. But this is not to say that to the sense there also corresponds a :ref:`bedeutung`. The words '*the celestial body most distant from the Earth*' have a sense, but it is very doubtful if they also have a reference. The expression '*the least rapidly convergent series*' has a sense; but it is known to have no reference, since for every given convergent series, another convergent, but less rapidly convergent, series can be found. In grasping a sense, one is not certainly assured of a reference.

      A concept - as I understand the word - is predicative^ On the other hand, a name of an object, a proper name, it quite incapable of being used as a grammatical predicate. This admittedly needs elucidation, otherwise it might appear false. Surely one can just as well assert of a thing that it is Alexander the Great, or is the number four, or is the planet Venus, as that it is green or is a mammal? If anybody thinks this, he is not distinguishing the uses of the word '*is*'. In the last two examples it serves as a copula, as a mere verbal sign of predication. As such it can sometimes be replaced by the mere personal suffix. Compare, e.g., '*Dieses Blatt ist griin*' and '*Dieses Blatt grunt*'.We are here saying that something falls under a concept, and the grammatical predicate stands for (*bedeutet*) this concept. In the first three examples, on the other hand, 'is' is used like the 'equals' sign in arithmetic, to express an equation. In the sentence '*The Morning Star is Venus*', we have two proper names, '*Morning Star*' and '*Venus*', for the same object. In the sentence '*The Morning Star is a planet*' we have a proper name, '*the Morning Star*', and a concept word, '*planet*'. So far as language goes, no more has happened than that '*Venus*' has been replaced by '*a planet*'; but really the relation has become wholly different. An equation is reversible; an object's falling under a concept is an irreversible relation. In the sentence '*The Morning Star is Venus*', '*is*' is obviously not the mere copula; its content is an essential part of the predicate, so that the word 'Venus' does not constitute the whole of the predicate. One might say instead: '*The Morning Star is no other than Venus*'; what was previously implicit in the single word 'is' is here set in four separate words, and in '*is no other than*' the word '*is*' now really is the mere copula. What is predicated here is thus not Venus but no other than Venus. These words stand for (*bedeuteri*) a concept; admitedly only one object falls under this, but such a concept must still always be distinguished from the object. We have here a word '*Venus*' that can never be a proper predicate, although it can form part of a predicate. The :ref:`bedeutung` of this word is thus something that can never incur as a concept, but only as an object.

      What is the :ref:`nothing` ? Our very first approach to this question has something unusual about it. In our asking we posit the :ref:`nothing` in advance as something that "is" such and such; we posit it as a being. But that is exactly what it is distinguished from. Interrogating the :ref:`nothing`--asking what and how it, the :ref:`nothing`, is--turns what is interrogated into its opposite. The question deprives itself of its own object. Accordingly, every answer to this question is also impossible from the start. For it necessarily assumes the form, the nothing "is" this or that. With regard to the nothing, question and answer alike are inherently absurd.

      Presence to self, on the contrary, supposes that an impalpable fissure has slipped into being. If being is present to itself, it is because it is not wholly itself. Presence is an immediate deterioration of coincidence, for it supposes separation. But if we ask ourselves at this point "what it is" which separates the subject from himself, we are forced to admit it is ":ref:`nothing`". Ordinarily what separates is a distance in space, a lapse in time, a psychological difference, or simply the individuality of two co-presents--in short, a "qualified" reality. But in the case which concerns us, ":ref:`nothing`" can separate the consciousness of belief from belief, since belief is "nothing other" than the consciousness of belief.

      Naturally, because the void is indiscernible as a term (because it is not-one), its inaugural appearance is a pure act of nomination. This name cannot be specific; it cannot place the void under anything that would subsume it--this would reestablish the one. The name cannot indicate that the void is this or that. The act of nomination, being a-specific, consumes itself, indicating :ref:`nothing` other than the unpresentable as such. In ontology, however, the unpresentable occurs within a presentative forcing which disposes it as the :ref:`nothing` from which everything proceeds. The consequence is that the name of the void is a pure *proper name*, which indicates itself, which does not bestow any index of difference within what it refers to, and which auto-declares itself in the form of the multiple, despite there being :ref:`nothing` which is numbered by it.

      Whenever we attempt to express the matter of immediate experience, we find that its understanding leads us beyond itself, to its contemporaries, to its past, to its future, and to the universals in terms of which its definiteness is exhibited. But such universals, by their very character of universality, embody the potentiality of other facts with varying types of definiteness. Thus the understanding of the immediate brute fact requires its metaphysical interpretation as an item in the world with some systematic relation to it. When thought comes upon the scene, it finds the interperations as matters of practice. Philosophy does not initiate interpretations. Its search for a rationalistic scheme is the search for more adequate criticism, and for more adequate justifications of the interpretations which we perforce employ. Our habitual experience is a complex of failure and success in the enterprise of interpretation. If we desire a record of uninterpreted experience, we must ask a stone to record its autobiography. Every scientific memoir in its records of the "facts" is shot through and through with interpretation. The methodology of rational interpretation is the product of the fitful vagueness of consciounsess. Elements which shine with immediate distinctness, in some circumstances, retire into pneumbral shadow in other circumstances, and into black darkness on other occasions. And yet all occasions proclaim themselves as actualities within the flux of a solid world, demanding a unity of interpretation.

      The main source of the difficulties met with seems to lie in the following: it has not always been kept in mind that the semantical concepts have a relative character, that they must always be related to a particular language. People have not been aware that the language about which we speak need by no means coincide with the language in which we speak. They have carried out the semantics of a language in that language itself and, generally speaking, they have proceeded as though there was only one language in the world. The analysis of the antimonies mentioned shows, on the contrary, that the semantical concepts simply have no place in the language to which they relate, that the language which contains its own semantics, and within which the usual logical laws hold, must inevitably be inconsistent.

        To say what rules of grammar make up a propositional game would require giving the characteristics of propositions, their grammar. We are thus led to the question, What is a proposition? I shall not try to give a general definition of "proposition", as it is impossible to do so. This is no more possible than it is to give a definition of the word "game". For any line we might draw would be arbitrary. Our way of talking about propositions is always in terms of specific examples, for we cannot talk about these more generally than about specific games. We could begin by giving examples such as the proposition "There is a circle on the blackboard 2 inches from the top and 5 inches from the side". Let us represent this as "(2,5)". Now let us construct something that would be said to make no :ref:`sense <sinn>`, "(2,5,7)". This would have to be explained (and you could give it sense), or else you could say it is a mistake or a joke. But if you say it makes no :ref:`sense <sinn>`, you can explain why by explaining the game in which it has no use. Nonsense can look less and less like a sentence, less and less like a part of language. "Goodness is red" and "Mr. S came to today's redness" would be called nonsense, whereas we would never say a whistle was nonsense. An arrangement of chairs could be taken as a language, so that certain arrangements would be nonsense. Theoretically you could always say of a symbol that it makes :ref:`sense <sinn>`, but if you did so you would be called upon to explain its :ref:`sense <sinn>`, that is, to show the use you give it, how you operate with it. The words "nonsense' and ":ref:`sense <sinn>`" get their meaning only in particular cases and may vary from case to case. We can still talk of :ref:`sense <sinn>` without giving a clear meaning to ":ref:`sense <sinn>`", just as we talk of winning or losing without the meaning of our terms being absolutely clear.

      All that up to the present time I have accepted as most :ref:`true <truth>` and certain I have learned either from the senses or through the senses; but it is sometimes proved to me that these senses are deceptive, and it is wiser not to trust entirely to anything by which we have once been deceived.
      
      But it may be that although the senses sometimes deceive us concerning things which are hardly perceptible, or very far away, there are yet many others to be met with as to which we cannot reasonably have any doubt, although we recognize them by their means. For example, there is the fact that I am here, seated by the fire, attired in a dressing gown, having this paper in my hands and other similar matters. And how could I deny that these hands and this body are mine, were it not perhaps that I compare myself to certain persons, devoid of sense, whose cerebella are so troubled and clouded by violent vapours of black bile, that they constantly assure us that they think they are kings when they are really quite poor, or that they are clothed in purple when they are really without covering, or who imagine that they have an earthernware head or are nothing but pumpkins or are made of glass. But they are mad, and I should be any the less insane were I to follow examples so extravagant.
      
      At the same time I must remember that I am a man, and that consequently I am in the habit of sleeping, and in my dreams representing to myself those same things or sometimes even less probable things, than do those who are insane in their waking moments. How often has it happened to me that in the night I dreamt that I found myself in this particular place, that I was dressed and seated near the fire, whilst in reality I was lying undressed in bed! At this moment it does indeed seem to me that it is with eyes awake that I am looking at this paper; that this head which I move is not asleep, that it is deliberately and of set purpose that I extend my hand and perceive it; what happens in sleep does not appear so clear nor so distinct as does all this. But in thinking over this I remind myself that on many occasions I have in sleep been deceived by similar illusions, and in dwelling carefully on this reflection I see so manifestly that there are no certain indications by which we may clearly distinguish wakefulness from sleep that I am lost in astonishment. And my astonishment is such that it is almost capable of persuading me that I now dream.
      
      I suppose, then, that all the things I see are false; I persuade myself that :ref:`nothing <nothing>` has ever existed of all that my fallacious memory represents to me. I consider that I possess no senses; I imagine that body, figure, extension, movement and place are but fictions of my mind. What, then, can be esteemed as true? Perhaps :ref:`nothing <nothing>` at all, unless that there is :ref:`nothing <nothing>` in this :ref:`world <world>` that is certain.

      The universe consists of objects having various qualities and standing in various relations. Some of the objects which occur in the universe are complex. When an object is complex, it consists of interrelated parts. Let us consider a complex object composed of two parts *a* and *b* standing to each other in the relation *R*. The complex object *"a-in-the-relation-R-to-b"* may be capable of being *perceived*; when perceived, it is perceived as one object. Attention may show that it is complex; we then *judge* that *a* and *b* stand in the relation *R*. Such a judgement, being derived from perception by mere attention, may be called a "*judgement of perception*." This judgement of perception, considered as an actual occurence, is a relation of four terms, namely *a* and *b* and *R* and the percipient. The percetpion, on the contrary, is a relation of two terms, namely *"a-in-the-relation-R-to-b"* and the percipient. Since an object of perception cannot be nothing, we cannot perceive "*a-in-the-relation-R-to-b*" unless *a* is in the relation *R* to *b*. Hence a judgement of perception, according to the above definition, must be :ref:`true <truth>`. This does not mean that, in a judgement which *appears* to us to be one of perception, we are sure of not being in error, since we may err in thinking that our judgement has really been derived merely by analysis of what was perceived. But if our judgement has been so derived, it must be :ref:`true <truth>`. In fact, we may define :ref:`truth`, where such judgements are concerned, as consisting in the fact that there is a complex *corresponding* to the discursive thought which is the judgement. That is, when we judge "*a* has the relation R to *b*," our judgement is said to be :ref:`true <truth>` when there is a complex "*a-in-the-relation-R-to-b*," and is said to be *false* when this is not the case. This is a definition of :ref:`truth` and falsehood in relation to judgements of this kind.

If he really does so, philosophical discernment has dawned on him. It then becomes clear and certain to him that he does not know a sun and an earth, but only an eye that sees a sun, a hand that feels an earth; that the :ref:`world` around him is there only as representation, in other words, only in reference to another thing, namely that which represents, and this is himself. If any truth can be expressed "a priori", it is this; for it is the statement of that :ref:`form` of all possible and conceivable experience, a form that is more general than all others, than time, space and causality, for all these presuppose it.

        The gods who came into being as Ptah: Ptah upon the Great Throne . . . 
        
        Ptah-Nun, the father who begot Atum . . . 
        
        Ptah-Naunet, the mother who bore Atum . . . 
        
        Ptah, the Great, that is the heart and tongue of the Ennead . . .
    
        There came into being from the heart and there came into being from the tongue [something] in the form of Atum. The mighty Great One is Ptah, who caused all gods [to live], as well as their kas, through his heart, by which Horus became Ptah, and through this tongue by which Thoth became Ptah. . .
    
        His Ennead is before him as teeth and lips, that is, the semen and hands of Atum. The Ennead of Atum came into being by his semen and fingers; the Ennead [of Ptah], however, is the teeth and lips in this mouth, which pronounced the name of everything, and from which Shu and Tefnut came forth, the fashioner of the Ennead.
    
        The sight of the eyes, the hearing of the ears, and the smelling of the air by the nose, they present to the heart. This is what causes every "completed [concept]" to come forth, and it is the tongue that repeats what the heart thinks.
        
        Thus all the gods were born and his Ennead was completed. Every word of the god ("hieroglyph"? "idea"?) came into being through what the heart thought and the tongue commanded.

        perfected the divine service and the august offices,

        When An, Enlil, Enki and Ninhursaga
        
        fashioned the dark-headed people
    
        they had made the small animals that come up from out of the earth,
        
        come from the earth in abundance
    
        and had let there be, as it befits it, gazelles
    
        wild donkeys, and four-footed beasts in the desert.

        Hail, children of Zeus! Grant lovely song and celebrate the holy race of the deathless gods who are for ever, those that were born of Earth and starry Heaven and gloomy Night and them that briny Sea did rear. Tell how at the first gods and earth came to be, and rivers, and the boundless sea with its raging swell, and the gleaming stars, and the wide heaven above, and the gods who were born of them, givers of good things, and how they divided their wealth, and how they shared their honors amongst them, and also how at the first they took many-folded Olympus. These things declare to me from the beginning, you Muses who dwell in the house of Olympus, and tell me which of them first came to be. 
        
        In truth at first Chaos came to be, but next wide-bosomed Earth, the ever-sure foundation of all the deathless ones who hold the peaks of snowy Olympus, and dim Tartarus in the depth of the wide-pathed Earth, and Eros, fairest among the deathless gods, who unnerves the limbs and overcomes the mind and wise counsels of all gods and all men within them. From Chaos came forth Erebus and black Night; but of Night were born Aether and Day, whom she conceived and bore from union in love with Erebus. And Earth first bore starry Heaven, equal to herself, to cover her on every side, and to be an ever-sure abiding-place for the blessed gods. And she brought forth long hills, graceful haunts of the goddess Nymphs who dwell amongst the glens of the hills. She bore also the fruitless deep with his raging swell, Pontus, without sweet union of love.

After them was born Cronos the wily, youngest and most terrible of her children, and he hated his lusty sire.

        Its outer fringe is all that we shall see.
    
    
        Under these two aspects, it is really the same; but as development takes place, it receives the different names. Together we call them the Mystery. Where the Mystery is the deepest is the gate of all that is subtle and wonderful.

        Seeing that everybody, gods of the world and mankind, says that nothing existed prior to chaos, I, in distinction to them, shall demonstrate that they are all mistaken, because they are not acquainted with the origin of chaos, nor with its root. Here is the demonstration.
    
        How well it suits all men, on the subject of chaos, to say that it is a kind of darkness! But in fact it comes from a shadow, which has been called by the name 'darkness'. And the shadow comes from a product that has existed since the beginning. It is, moreover, clear that it existed before chaos came into being, and that the latter is posterior to the first product. Let us therefore concern ourselves with the facts of the matter; and furthermore, with the first product, from which chaos was projected. And in this way the truth will be clearly demonstrated.
    
        After the natural structure of the immortal beings had completely developed out of the infinite, a likeness then emanated from Pistis (Faith); it is called Sophia (Wisdom). It exercised volition and became a product resembling the primeval light. And immediately her will manifested itself as a likeness of heaven, having an unimaginable magnitude; it was between the immortal beings and those things that came into being after them, like [...]: she (Sophia) functioned as a veil dividing mankind from the things above.
    
        Now the eternal realm of truth has no shadow outside it, for the limitless light is everywhere within it. But its exterior is shadow, which has been called by the name 'darkness'. From it, there appeared a force, presiding over the darkness. And the forces that came into being subsequent to them called the shadow 'the limitless chaos'. From it, every kind of divinity sprouted up [...] together with the entire place, so that also, shadow is posterior to the first product. It was the abyss that it appeared, deriving from the aforementioned Pistis.
    
        Then shadow perceived there was something mightier than it, and felt envy; and when it had become pregnant of its own accord, suddenly it engendered jealousy. Since that day, the principle of jealousy amongst all the eternal realms and their worlds has been apparent. Now as for that jealousy, it was found to be an abortion without any spirit in it. Like a shadow, it came into existence in a vast watery substance. Then the bile that had come into being out of the shadow was thrown into a part of chaos. Since that day, a watery substance has been apparent. And what sank within it flowed away, being visible in chaos: as with a woman giving birth to a child - all her superfluities flow out; just so, matter came into being out of shadow, and was projected apart. And it did not depart from chaos; rather, matter was in chaos, being in a part of it.
    
        And when these things had come to pass, then Pistis came and appeared over the matter of chaos, which had been expelled like an aborted fetus - since there was no spirit in it. For all of it (chaos) was limitless darkness and bottomless water. Now when Pistis saw what had resulted from her defect, she became disturbed. And the disturbance appeared, as a fearful product; it rushed to her in the chaos. She turned to it and blew into its face in the abyss, which is below all the heavens.
    
        And when Pistis Sophia desired to cause the thing that had no spirit to be formed into a likeness and to rule over matter and over all her forces, there appeared for the first time a ruler, out of the waters, lion-like in appearance, androgynous, having great authority within him, and ignorant of whence he had come into being. Now when Pistis Sophia saw him moving about in the depth of the waters, she said to him, "Child, pass through to here," whose equivalent is 'yalda baoth'.
    
        Since that day, there appeared the principle of verbal expression, which reached the gods and the angels and mankind. And what came into being as a result of verbal expression, the gods and the angels and mankind finished. Now as for the ruler Yaltabaoth, he is ignorant of the force of Pistis: he did not see her face, rather he saw in the water the likeness that spoke with him. And because of that voice, he called himself 'Yaldabaoth'. But 'Ariael' is what the perfect call him, for he was like a lion. Now when he had come to have authority over matter, Pistis Sophia withdrew up to her light.

        I want to speak about bodies changed into new forms. You, gods, since you are the ones who alter these, and all other things, inspire my attempt, and spin out a continuous thread of words, from the world's first origins to my own time.
    
        Before there was earth or sea or the sky that covers everything, Nature appeared the same throughout the whole world: what we call chaos: a raw confused mass, nothing but inert matter, badly combined discordant atoms of things, confused in the one place. There was no Titan yet, shining his light on the world, or waxing Phoebe renewing her white horns, or the earth hovering in surrounding air balanced by her own weight, or watery Amphitrite stretching out her arms along the vast shores of the world. Though there was land and sea and air, it was unstable land, unswimmable water, air needing light. Nothing retained its shape, one thing obstructed another, because in the one body, cold fought with heat, moist with dry, soft with hard, and weight with weightless things.
