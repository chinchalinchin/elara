    While Newton was in England developing his three laws from which he would deduce a broad array of phenomenon, such as planetary motion, geometric optics, etc., work was being done in continential Europe to express physical law in terms of an extremum principle. Rather than asserting the three laws of the motion as the primitives of mechanics, Hamilton and Lagrange showed these laws were the result of a more fundamental principle, that of *least action*:
    
    .. admonition:: Principle of Least Action 
    
        The trajectory of a particle between two fixed points in time is such that it extremizes the quantity of *action*. 
    
    Where *action* is defined as the difference between the potential and kinetic energy in a system integrated over the time period in consideration, i.e. the accumulated excess energy over and above what is proscribed by the system itself. By asserting motion is such that it minimizes this quantity, Newton's laws naturally fall out of the mathematical conversation of energy.
    
    By positing the laws of motions thus, Hamilton and Lagrange displayed a formulation which represents the world as the intersection of all possibilities. It is as if the universe looked at all the possible lines that connected two points and brought into existence only the single one which satisfied the conditions of necessity.
    
    Except when we say "*universe*" in the preceding, we should be careful, for what we truly mean is the apprehensions of the subject apprehending, the :ref:`dasein` that reflects on its Being. Hamilton and Lagrange have expressed an opinion on an ontological primitive: balance is an immanent, self-evident form.

    The great workhorse of mathematics is proof by contradiction. An assumption is made, an absurdity is shown to result from the assumption, therefore the assumption is shown to be false. In this way was modern mathematics constructed, by outlining the truth and demarcating its boundary with falsity. Anyone who has studied higher mathematics will attest to the way most mathematical proofs work by letting the truth "`in through the back door <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38427>`_", that is to say, they work by showing what cannot be the case in order to prove the opposite must be so, but this gets us no closer to *why* it is so.
    
    This method does not reveal the *intuition*  the theorem to the observer; indeed one can comprehend a proof without understanding anything about what it trying to say and in the converse direction, one may understand a concept without being able to grasp its proof in the slightest.
    
    So it is with induction: the proof of induction, and therefore every proof *by* induction, relies on a contradiction that an element belongs to two mutually exclusive sets, which we are forced to admit is absurdity, therefore we conclude induction must be true; but nowhere in the proof do we see why the form in an induced series is transmitted from one term to the next. Likewise, a student can spend an entire academic career studying the axioms and theorems of real analysis and still have no intuition for how a falling stone's trajectory traces a parabola with respect to time, despite having memorized a series of proofs that show how to go from set theory to differential calculus.

    Frege uncovers an interesting contingency in the logical form in his definitions of primitive Number. In modern symbolism, he is defining 0 and 1 respectively in terms of the cardinality of sets, i.e. in terms of the enumeration of objects, 
    
    .. math::
    
        A = \{ x \mid x \neq x \} 
    
    .. math::
    
        n(A) = 0 
    
    Zero is defined as the cardinality of a contradictory set. Logic, as it were, has an opinion of itself, namely that its contradictions are empty. This, however, requires the symbolism to express the contradictions that must contain nothing via the contingency of their form.
    
    Furthermore, the subsequent form of numbers can be expressed via recursion back to this original proposition about the cardinality of contradictions.
    
    .. math::
        
        B = \{ y \mid y = n(A) \}
    
    .. math::
        
        n(B) = 1
    
    Take note, the form of the contradiction is irrrelevant. We could as well define zero as the cardinality of the negation of the excluded middle, but there is nevertheless an inherent property to any form we substitute into the Fregean definition of zero: the expression will always involve an indeterminate x and a relation that cannot possibly result in a judgement of truth even in its indeterminacy, exemplified in Frege's case as the inabilty of thing to not be itself. The foundation of Frege's arithmetic philosophy rests on the ontological equivalence of contradiction and nullity.

    Consider the etymological link between *passion* and *passive*. In the first reading, one might make the mistake of assuming a polarity between these terms, that is to say, a diametrical opposition. The former is a driving force whereas the latter is the lack of a driving force.
    
    However, both emerge from a common Latin root of *passio*: to endure. That which is passive endures any state impressed upon it, while that which is passionate endures (perhaps unwillingly) the burden of seizure, of complete domination by an external source. In both cases, there is a commonality: the removal of the subject. The subject in a passive state is the same as a subject in a passionate state, which is null and void. In neither case is there a conscious decision to be made; instead one surrenders themselves to an unknown sovereignty; unknown because consciousness relinquishes its ability to care; sovereign because it is the determinate factor in the outcome that proceeds from said state.

    Everything is language.
    
    Everything signifies something it is not. 
    
    As I get older, the thoughts are harder to string together. More and more, it is a morass of half-understood images, glimpsed with uncertain comprehension. It feels like my mind is falling apart. 
    
    I want to say something definite: that what we are is symbolic. Our nature consists of naming and relating. There is no greater power in this world than to invoke a thing's name, to draw it into the foreground of attention and present that which is named as a singular thing, separate and isolated from the world in which it arose. 
    
    They tell me I am made of particles, incomprehensibly tiny things that are concentrated into mathematical points, but then I am told this is not quite right, because points have positions and no one has ever been able to say where exactly a particle is. 
    
    Science has a hole in its foundation. Or more precisely: an impassable bedrock that prevents the inductive advance of human knowledge beyond a prescribed depth, the limit of abstraction. Predicated on measurement, science immediately deteriorates when the truth upon which it rests is sought. 
    
    The idea that things can be measured relies on the idea that a property of a thing can be abstracted away from the thing's being. A thing is not a unit, but it is equal, in some way, to the units which comprise its measurement. Equality, as a concept, only obtains when a thing is abstracted of its qualities and reduced to a quantitative description. 
    
    To understand everything as measureable is to understand everything as a quantity. The act of measurement is equivalent to comparison. A thing is named to be the unit. To measure a thing is to relate it to this designation. To say a thing has two units it to say it has two units *of* the designated unit. 
    
    Humans have somehow inverted the direction of dependence in the relation of measurement to reality. We live with an unconscious assumption, at least in aggregate within the context of the modern world, one that happens to be false: that the only things that are real are those which can be measured. We have abstracted from measurement a definite mathematical structure the world must abide. And so we fail to comprehend the fundamental uncertainty from which being is born.
    
    Measurement can only exist in relation to the units which have been demarcated and designated as things which measure. Measurability cannot be the basis for being, because it must be predicated on a reference to another being, namely the unit, which only exists as a designation within an interpretation. In other words, the entire edifice of science presupposes a subject is *in the world*, engaged in the act of interpretation.

    There are no answers. More fundamentally, there does not even exist the possibility of an answer.

    The problem is truth. It's impossible to define. More precisely: it's definition undoes its foundation. If you say: something is true if it is the case (i.e. agrees with reality), then by allowing the indeterminate sentence to be named, even with a name so innocuous as "something", you've allowed the necessary and sufficient conditions for a contradiction to emerge. Let the next sentence be called P. The sentence P is not true. Then, by our definition of truth, we see we have named an undecidable sentence.  More than that, we have annihilated the possibility of truth by demonstrating an example of something to which it cannot apply, that is, something neither true or false. Self reference is a paradox that cannot be exorcised; it's impossible to give a name to something without that name referencing the thing to be named. You cannot talk about truth without giving things names and you cannot name a thing without decimating the foundations of language. We arise from a vacuum of meaning, and blindly seek what cannot be sought. All that we know and think is built on top of a void.

        "*Being*" is said in many ways. 
    
        -- Categories, Aristotle
    
    It is first of all said, and "*to be said*" requires what is said to be expressible in language. Every linguistic form is a representation. Therefore, something said is necessarily representative of some other thing. What a representation is and what it is representative of is left vague in the beginning, but the form of representation is not: language.  
    
    In order to understand the initial statement, one then turns to an analysis of language in order to clarify what could possibly be meant by a thing which can be said. A description of language is a necesary component of any exposition that wants to analyze the ways in which "*being*" is said. In making this description, one immediately encounters the essential problem in ontological endeavors: describing the operation of "*description*"" is itself a description. 
    
    Every system of thought, by objectifying the world, makes an object of itself within that system. "*System*" in this sense is synonymous with and equivalent to "*language*".
    
    For instance, lingustic representations possess the property of standing for things they themselves are not. 
    
    .. note::
    
        Let "*R*" stand for things that are red. 
    
        Let "*B*" stand for things that are blue.
    
    Here a letter, "*R*" or "*B*" , stands in place of something else. These letters are *representations*. Note the letter "*R*"" is not a thing that is red, except in circumstances where it is printed in red ink. Rather, it symbolizes the conjunction in thought of elements that possess the attribute of "*being red*". The letter "*R*" makes an abstraction of the elements we agree belong to it. 
    
    ---
    
    On the other hand, there are sometimes classes of words that stand for themselves, or at least include themselves in that for which they stand. For example, the word "*word*" is a word that stands for the thing which it is,
    
        "*Word*" is a word.
    
    However, a crucial distinction must be drawn in these cases. The quotation marks in the preceding example are not frivolities. They are a necessary component of the proposition, for they provide a boundary that outlines a thing's *name*. Sans quotation marks, the proposition descends into senselessness,
    
        Word is a word.
    
    This analysis hinges on the realization first proffered by Tarski that there is a consequential difference between the language in which we speak propositions of a language and the language in which we speak *about* the propositions of a language. 
    
        The language one speaks is not necessarily the language about which one speaks. 
    
    Confusion often results when the same language performs both functions. In the case of mathematics, where the proposition language is that of, say, arithmetic, and the description language that of logic, the distinction is easier to maintain. When doing philosophy, the different levels of speech often waver and blur together, leading to confusion. For the purposes of clarity, quotation marks serve the function of referring to the name of the concept addressed whereas a unquoted word expresses what is meant by the concept. This lack of clarity throughout history is one of the root causes of Martin Heidegger's deconstruction of "*being*" in the early twentieth century.
    
    If the goal is to define "*being*", then one can only succeed at the level of description. A description *about* a "*being*" is incapable of saying what is meant by "*being*".

    When one authentically speaks the phrase "*I know this*", one understands this to be meant in the context of certainy. "*Knowledge*", if the term is to mean anything at all, must be defined in terms of certainty. "*It is known*" must be replaceable in all instances with "*it is certain*"
    
    The question of what is certain has no obvious or immediate answer, and so the existence of pure knowledge, of a kind that is absolute and without condition, is called into question. The world and all of its contents seem so hopelessly dependent on the subjective experience that one cannot truly convince one's self that it exists in the absence of the subject. 
    
    The world presents itself, but the basis for the knowledge of this presentation is its representation to the self. 
    
    Everything imaginable is contained in, or possibly equal to, the enumeration of all possible representations. What cannot be imagined is precisely that which cannot be represented to the self. If a possibility exists that cannot be imagined, then it is only because "*self*" does not entail the totality of possibility. This can only occur if the representations presented to the self are incomplete, that is, if the presentation lacks content that cannot be comprehended through its representative form.

    .. epigraph::
    
        If you do know that "*here is one hand*", we'll grant you all the rest.
    
        -- On Certainty, Wittgenstein
    
    If the objective is to produce a certain fact, then all assumptions must be removed and one must start from nothing. Only the production of a fact from nullity would be able to satisfy any reasonable definition of "*certainty*". If a fact derives from a prior assumption, then the fact is only as certain as its constitutive assumptions. Therefore, the question of the validity of the concept of "*certainy*" reduces to the question of whether positive knowledge can be derived from nothing. 
    
    It is a maxim of post-Kantian philosophy that what is known must be known through the experience of "*knowing*", and thus it must be conditioned by experience. Knowledge of a thing is knowledge of the sensuous experience of the thing and what the sensuous cannot present to experience cannot be known.
    
    For any object of experience, its attributes may be abstracted away in thought, but even an indeterminate object must possess a condition of determination for being able to be an object of experience; it is this form of determination that Kant identifies as "*a-priori*". If, from a thing, its manifest qualities are subtracted, one is left with the pure abstract relation that sensuous experience deploys in order to perform the ontological operation of objectification.
    
    The operands of the objectification are the experience for which the object is and the object thus identified by experience. This operation yields a unique index, which one is inclined to call an object's "*name*". In other words, receptivity to naming is a prerequisite for being knowable. A thing cannot be known unless it can be named.
    
    The inverse does not follow. One cannot conclude from "*if a thing cannot be named, then it cannot be known*" that "*if a thing cannot be known, then a thing cannot be named*". If the latter were the case, then one would lack a proper name for "*nothing*".

    The desire for exegesis cannot be met without recourse to personal experience, and in introducing the subjective element, the exegesis itself is undone. One wants a formal deduction, a series of arguments absolute and pure, proceeding from a starting point whose self-evidence is immanent. One wants to find the words to lay upon this thing called life like a map, to show what it is and how it is to be understood. We seek a science that explains what it is to be, that will, as part of its apparatus, integrate our very consciousness into its fabric and render unto us a divine sort of revelation.
    
    This is the essential human delusion. Essential, because it resides in every activity; there is nothing which is which does not presuppose the law of cause and effect, and so we come to be supposing all which is must abide this fundamental law. Human, because it is our poetical curse to attach symbols to objects. Delusion, because the subject will never find itself among objects, except as an object.
    
    We imagine the written word like a mirror, a silvered surface that reflects and reveals the point of origin but our thoughts are not like rays of light, and the page is no surface to preserve in perfect fashion the objects incident upon it. The word always grasps towards what it wants to represent, but fails in its approach of its origin. 
    
    Is there a series of words that explains the world's churning? Mathematicians tells us to fix our definitions, and let logic unfold. With what definition do we start? *To be*, seems the most general of relations, the most primitive of terms. Thus, we initiate again an Aristotelian chain, whose history is available to any student of philsophy. Such an exercise, though worthwhile, will only yield formal results, against which we will inevitably rebel in Heideggerian fashion, and then succumb, forgetting in essence our original task. 
    
    I want to tell you what I know, but the words that I would use to give form to my thoughts escape me. I labor in vain for quiet hours. There is structure in our experience, in our lives, underneath its surface, if only it were presented, so that it might be represented in symbolic form. 
    
    It is easy to slip into solipsism, like a Cartesian fingertrap. One must remember that language presumes the presence of another. Though the world as we know it may lack facts, it never lacks form. The existence of words is testament to the communal aspect of reality, that when we are in the world, we are in the world with someone else. The world, a veil though it may be in its appearance, is substantial, because it can be described, and a decription can only exist *for* someone. 
    
    Let us start any exegesis with this simple proposition whose tautological nature is thus self evident:
    
        What is said requires some one to say it.
    
    Let us use this a ballast when the ontological investigations we undertake lead us astray, into a nihilistic miasma. It is ever evident in history that when one investigates, one necessarily makes everything subject to investigation.

    The Context Problem
    -------------------
    
    As a thought experiment, suppose you encountered a string in an unknown language,
    
    .. math::
    
        a = b = c 
    
    Without any further information about the language, nearly any interpretation can be assigned to this expression. There is a small amount of information encoded in the repetition of "=", which imposes a light constraint on the possible interpretations, but the meaning of these interpretations is still too diverse to say with any measure of certainty what this expression could possibly mean. "=" could, for example, serve the dual role of a *relativizer* and an *indicator*, allowing such interpretations as,
    
        lady that sings that tune
    
    In this interpretation, "a" is assigned the meaning of "(the) lady", "b" that of "sings" and "c" that of "tune". Obviously, a large number, possibly infinite in size, of such expressions can be constructed. 
    
    Suppose you are provided a dictionary of *primitive* symbols. This dictionary fixes the meaning of the "=" to the familiar concept of "equality". However, even this disambiguating assignment stills the leave door open to a myriad of interpretations. This assignment imposes only the lightest of constraints on the other word-forms in the expression. For example, it is unclear if the expression with the "equality" assignment should be interpretted as meaning,
    
        "a = b" and "b = c"
    
    Or
    
        a = (b = c)
    
    Or
    
        (a = b) = c
    
    In the first interpretation, "a", "b" and "c" must represent terms within the language. In the second interpretation, "a" fills the meta-role of a truth value while "b" and "c" fill the roles of terms in the object language. In the third interpretation, "a" and "b" fill the roles of object terms while "c" fills the role of a truth value. 
    
    In other words, the assignment of the meaning of "=" imposes certain constraints on the values the other word-forms in the expression may range over, but ambiguity still remains. Indeed, it may argued a quanta of ambiguity is always present in any interpretation assigned to a string of symbols. 
    
    The essential *context* problem boils down to: what word-form in an expression should it treat as primitive in order to use as a foundation upon which to build the subsequent interpretation.

    A perfect palindrome is symmetric, a mirror image of itself no matter which way it is written. Of the types of palindromes, they are likely the most rare, because their grammatical conditions are so stringent, at least as far as English is concerned. 
    
    Perfect palindromes mostly hinge on invertible grammatical structures embodied in the "*on-no*", "*now-won*" and "*saw-was*" invertible pairs. Without these invertible pivot points, a perfect palindrome must rely on the symmetry of a central palindromic word. 
    
    In other words, the cardinality of perfect palindromes is related to the cardinality of invertible words and the cardinality of purely reflective words. 
    
    - repel on no leper
    - dog saw raw war was god
    - gateman now won nametag
    - snoops now won spoons
    - pupils did slipup
    - strips deified spirits
    
    Compare these examples to a case like "*borrow or rob*" which, while palindromic, does not preserve its semantic content under inversion.
