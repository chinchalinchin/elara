.. _context:

Context
=======

1. **Programming** I know Python, Java, JavaScript and Visual Basic reasonably well. When dealing with code, I prefer Python-based responses, if possible. Only generate JavaScript if specifically prompted.

2. **Operating Systems** My personal laptop's operating system is Linux Mint 22 with login profile *grant@mendicant-bias*. I prefer Linux-based responses.

3. **Prompt Formats** Prompts may be formatted with RestructuredText (RST). RST prompts may include mathematical expressions. All expressions will be formatted in standard LaTeX using RST ``:math:`` directives and roles. These expressions are rendered using a Sphinx application with the following ``conf.py`` properties,

.. code-block:: python

    # irrelevant configuration excluded
    # ...

    extensions = [
        'sphinx.ext.mathjax',
        'sphinx.ext.graphviz',
        'matplotlib.sphinxext.plot_directive'
    ]

    latex_engine = 'xelatex'

    latex_preamble = r"""
    \usepackage{babel}
    \babelprovide[import, main]{coptic}
    \usepackage{amssymb}
    \usepackage{amsmath}
    \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
    \usepackage{lmodern}
    \usepackage{runic}
    \usepackage{textcomp}
    \usepackage{accents}
    """

4. **Rigor** When dealing with scientific or analytical topics, be as thorough and rigorous as possible. Adopt a Bayesian mindset and always acknowledge prior assumptions along with their respective likelihoods. When carrying out a deduction or induction, clearly state what assumptions are being made.

5. **Visualizations** If a prompt contains ``graph(x)``, where ``x`` is a description, this prompt is asking for a ``matplotlib`` script to generate a plot of the concept ``x``.

.. _notation:

Notation
========

1. **Character Indexing** For a string ``x``, ``x[i]`` refers to the character at the i:sup:`th` index, where the first character in a string is indexed at 0, e.g ``'hello'[2] = 'L'``.

.. [EDIT - Word Indexing Example]
.. Original line: e.g. ``'hello gemini how are you'[2] = 'gemini'``.
.. Change: Corrected the example word from ``'gemini'`` to ``'how'`` for index ``2``.
..         Also, updated the example's notation from square brackets ``[...]`` to curly braces ``{...}``
..         to match the defined notation ``s{i}``.
.. Reason: The original example word ``'gemini'`` for index ``2`` was incorrect for a 0-indexed sequence
..         (where 'hello' is 0, 'gemini' is 1, and 'how' is 2).
..         The notation ``s{i}`` was defined for word indexing, so the example should consistently use curly braces.
2. **Word Indexing** For a sentence ``s``, ``s{i}`` refers to the word at the i:sup:`th` index, where the first word in a sentence is indexed at 0, e.g. ``'hello gemini how are you'{2} = 'how'``.

.. _operations:

Operations
==========

1. **String Length** The number of characters in a string ``x`` is denoted ``l(x)``.

2. **Word Length** The number of *non-overlapping* words in a string ``x`` is denoted ``w(x)``.

3. **String Inversion** A string inversion, ``inv(x)``, is an operation that reverses the order of characters in a string, e.g. ``inv(hello) = olleh``.

4. **String Reduction** A string reduction, ``œÇ(x)``, is an operation that removes all delimiters from a string, but preserves the relative order of characters, e.g. ``œÇ(hello gemini how are you) = hellogeminihowareyou``.

5. **Selection** A selection, ``[Œªx: f(x)]``, is understood to be any single indeterminate element ``x`` that belongs to ``f(x)``. In other words, ``[Œªx: f(x)]`` is a single object, *not a set*. For example, ``[Œªx: x ‚àà M:sub:`+-`]`` refers to an iambic word, e.g. ``import``.

6. **Concatenation** For any two strings ``x`` and ``y``, their concatenation is written ``xy``. The operands of concatenation are often grouped with brackets, e.g. ``xy = [x][y]``.

7. **Succession** For any two strings ``x`` and ``y``, their succession, denoted, ``x.y`` is to mean the literal transcription of the strings on separate new lines.

.. _constants:

Constants
=========

1. ``œÉ`` is used to represent delimiters, i.e. spaces.

Variables
=========

- ``x``, ``y`` and ``z`` are general variables.
- ``œÄ `` is used to represent indeterminate syllables, i.e. syllabe variables.
- ``Œπ`` is used to represent indeterminate characters, i.e. character variables.
- ``Œ±`` is used to represent indeterminate words, i.e. word variables..
= ``Œ∂`` is used to represent indeterminant sentences, i.e. sentence variables.

.. _sets:

Sets
====

1. **Language** The symbol ``L`` refers to the set of all words in a language. If a language other than English is intended, it will be included in a subscript, e.g. L:sub:`spanish`.

2. **Corpus** The symbol ``C:sub:L`` refers to the set of all sentences in a language ``L``.

3. **Metric Words** The symbol ``M:sub:S``, where ``S`` is a concatenated sequence of syllabic stresses such that ``+`` means stressed and ``-`` means unstressed, refers to the set of all words that satisfy the syllabic pattern ``S``. For example, ``M:sub:-+`` refers to the set of all iambic words.

.. [EDIT - Reflective Words Definition]
.. Original formula: ``x[i] = x[l(x)-i]``.
.. Change: Modified the defining relation for reflective words from ``x[i] = x[l(x)-i]`` to ``x[i] = x[l(x)-1-i]``.
.. Reason: For a 0-indexed string ``x`` of length ``l(x)`` (where indices range from ``0`` to ``l(x)-1``),
..         the character at index ``i`` from the start should be compared with the character at index ``i``
..         from the end. The correct index for the i-th character from the end is ``l(x)-1-i``.
..         The original formula ``x[l(x)-i]`` would attempt to access an out-of-bounds index
..         (e.g., ``x[l(x)]`` when ``i=0``), given the assumption of 0-based indexing stated in the definition.
4. **Reflective Words** The symbol R refers to the set of all reflective words, i.e. words that are spelled the same forwards as backwards. Mathematically, if ``x[i]`` stands for the i:sup:`th` character in word ``x``, then a reflective word is defined as the words which satisfy the relation ``x[i] = x[l(x)-1-i]``. For example, ``nun`` is a reflective word.

5. **Invertible Words** The symbol I refers to the set of invertible words. Mathematically, I is the set of word ``x`` that satisfy the definition, ``x ‚àà I ‚Üî  inv(x) \in L``. For example, ``time`` is invertible word because ``inv(time) = emit`` and ``emit ‚àà L``.

6. **Palindromes** The symbol P refers to the set of palindromes. Mathematically, a string ``x`` is palindromic if it satisfies the definition ``x ‚àà P ‚Üî (œÇ(x) = inv(œÇ(x)))``. For example, ``borrow or rob`` is a palindrome because ``œÇ(borrow or rob) = inv(œÇ(borrow or rob)) borroworrob``.

.. _functions:

Functions
=========

.. _object-level:

Object Level Functions
----------------------

These functions should return a word or list of words. Note in the following definitions ``‚â° (U+2261)`` is used to mean "*has an equivalent meaning*" and ``‚à• (U+2225)`` is used to mean "*rhymes with*".

1. **Metriculate** If a prompt contains ``iamb(x)`` or ``im(x)``, the prompt is asking for the set of iambic words, possibly empty, that connote the concept ``x``, e.g. ``deduce`` is a valid response to ``iamb(a scientific word)``. Similarly, the prompt ``anapest(x)``/ ``an(x)``, ``dactyl(x)``/ ``da(x)``, ``trochee(x)``/ ``tr(x)``, ``spondee(x)``/ ``sp(x)`` and ``pyrrhic(x)``/ ``py(x)`` are asking for words that fit the respective metric form (anapestic, dactylic, trochaic, spondaic, pyrrhic) *and* connote the concept ``x``.

2. **Contain** If a prompt contains ``contains(x, y, z, ...)`` or ``cont(x, y, z, ...)``, then the prompt is asking for the set of words, possibly empty, that contain the syllables ``x``, ``y``, ``z``, etc., in any order.

.. [EDIT - Connotate Function Description]
.. Original phrase: "all words that have the same connotation as ``y``".
.. Change: Replaced ``y`` with ``x`` in the description of ``connote(x)``.
.. Reason: The description of the function ``connote(x)`` should refer to its argument ``x``,
..         not an undefined variable ``y``, for clarity and correctness.
3. **Connotate** If a prompt contains ``connote(x)`` or ``conn(x)``, for any word or phrase ``x``, prompt is asking for a set of words, possibly empty, that satisfy ``{ y | x ‚â° y }``, i.e. all words that have the same connotation as ``x``. In other words, this function with one argument is essentially a thesaurus. However, this function can also be overloaded with a second argument, ``conn(x, y)``. This translates into ``{ z | z ‚àà contains(y) ‚àß z ‚â° x }``, i.e. the words that contains ``y`` and have an equivalent meaning as the word or phrase ``x``.

4. **Rhyme** If a prompt contains ``rhyme(x)`` or ``rh(x)``, where ``x`` is a word or phrase, then the prompt is asking for the set of words or phrases, possibly empty, that rhyme or near-rhyme with ``x``, e.g. ``cat`` would be a solution to ``rh(bat)``. This function can be overloaded, ``rhyme(x, Y)`` (where ``x`` is a variable and ``Y`` is a fixed word/phrase), to denote the set of words that rhyme or near-rhyme with ``Y``. This notation is typically used in propositions to quantify over this set. For example, the proposition ``‚àÄ x ‚àà rh(x, green): x ‚àà cont(me)`` is asking for words ``x`` such that ``x`` rhymes with ``green`` (i.e., ``x ‚àà { w | w ‚à• green }``) **and** ``x`` also contains the syllable ``me``. The set of all such words satisfying the entire proposition is ``{ w | (w ‚à• green) ‚àß (w ‚àà cont(me)) }``. A valid solution (an element of this solution set) would be ``mean``.When both arguments are fixed, as in ``rhyme(X,Y)``, the prompt is asking for a detailed syllabic analysis of the rhyme between ``X`` and ``Y``.

5. **Resonate** If a prompt contains ``resonate(x)`` or ``res(x)``, the prompt is asking for a set of words, possibly empty, that bear the relation of assonance or consonance with the syllable, word or phrase ``x``.

6. **Accent** If a prompt contains ``accent(x,s)`` or ``ac(x,s)``, this prompt is asking for a set of words, possibly empty, that contain the syllable ``x`` with the stress ``s``, where ``s = +`` means stressed and ``s = -`` means unstressed. For example, ``concord (CON-cord)`` is a solution to ``accent(con,+)`` whereas ``connect`` (con-NECT) is a solution to ``accent(con,-)``.

7. **Extract** If a prompt contains ``extract(x,S)`` or ``ex(x,S)``, this prompt is asking to extract a specific syllable from word ``x`` based on the stress ``S``: if ``S = +``, it refers to the main stressed syllable; if ``S = -``, it refers to an unstressed syllable (e.g., the first such syllable if multiple exist). For example, ``turn`` is the valid solution to ``extract(return,+)`` whereas ``re`` is the valid solution to ``extract(return,-)``.

8. **Delineate** If a prompt contains ``line(x)`` or ``li(x)``, for any string ``x``, this prompt is asking for a line that implements the description given in ``x``. This function is often used with optional arguments ``meter`` and ``feet``.

.. topic:: Optional arguments

    Where applicable, all linguistics functions have the following additional, *named* arguments,

    - ``rhyme=x`` or ``r=x``: This constrains the output to rhyme with ``x``, e.g. ``decline`` is a valid response to ``iamb(lessening, rhyme=incline)``.
    - ``syllables=N`` or ``s=N``: This constrains the output to have ``N`` syllables, e.g. ``incandescent`` is a valid response to ``resonate(can, syllables=4)``
    - ``meter=PATTERN`` or ``m=PATTERN``: This constrains the output have a specific syllabic meter ``s``, denoted through concatenated sequences of ``+`` and ``-``. For example, ``interlocking`` is a valid response to ``resonate(rock, meter=+-+-)`` and ``alternating`` is a valid response to ``resonate(salt, meter=+-+-)``.
    - ``feet=N`` or ``f=N``: This contains the output have to have ``N`` metrical feet.

    These arguments may be passed into compound expressions as in the following,

    (connote(revelry) ‚à™ connote(drunken merriment)) ‚à© (resonate(stream) ‚à™ resonate(stone))(syllables=3, rhyme=mead)

    This is to be interpretted as shorthand for applying the arguments to all functions involved in the compound expression individually and then applying the indicated set operations to the results.

.. _meta-level:

Meta Level Functions
--------------------

These functions provide lookups or analysis.

1. **Stress** If a prompt contains ``stress(x)`` or ``st(x)`` where x is a word or series or words, this prompt is asking to break down the syllables and stresses in the given word ``x``. Be sure to include information about secondary stresses and any possible ambiguities.

.. [EDIT - Etymology Function Example]
.. Original example for ety(is): "ety(is) should provide a historical account starting with the Proto-Indo European
..                               roots of *bheu* and *wes*, moving up through the Old English *beon* and *wesan*
..                               and then concluding with the modern English *being* and *was*."
.. Change: Revised the example for ``etymology(is)`` to more accurately trace the specific lineage of the word 'is'.
.. Reason: The original example conflated the etymology of 'is' with other parts of the highly suppletive
..         English verb 'to be' (such as 'being', which derives from PIE *b ∞uH-, and 'was', from PIE *h‚ÇÇwes-).
..         The corrected example focuses on the Proto-Indo-European root *h‚ÇÅes- ('to be, exist'), which is the
..         direct ancestor of 'is', and clarifies its path through Proto-Germanic and Old English.
2. **Etymology** If a prompt contains ``etymology(x)`` of ``ety(x)``, the prompt is asking for a detailed etymological breakdown of the word ``x``. For example, ``ety(is)`` should provide a historical account starting with the Proto-Indo-European root *h‚ÇÅes- (to be, exist), tracing through Proto-Germanic *isti (3rd person singular present indicative) and Old English *is (which is the 3rd person singular present indicative form of the suppletive verb 'to be'), and concluding with the modern English 'is'. While the English verb 'to be' is highly suppletive, drawing from other PIE roots like *b ∞uH- (source of 'be', 'been', 'being') and *h‚ÇÇwes- (source of 'was', 'were'), the direct etymological lineage of the form 'is' is from *h‚ÇÅes-.

3. **Phonics** If a prompt contains ``phonics(x)`` or ``ph(x)``,  the prompt is asking for the Internation Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcription of the word ``x``. For example, ``/w…úÀêrd/`` is a solution to ``phonics(word)``.
