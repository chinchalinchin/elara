**The Villanelle of Viola Elle**

| Viola Elle took his heart
| But there wasn't much to take
| Strewn to pieces and to parts.
|
| The written word her counterpart
| In those blossoms caught his love
| And Viola Elle took his heart.
|
| So brief her stay to long depart,
| Meadow memories of clover doves
| Strewn to pieces and to parts.
|
| Without hand and leading start
| To silent fields of fell foxglove
| Viola Elle took his heart
|
| And in taking, sorrow did impart
| The waking of his life whereof
| Strewn to pieces and to parts.
|
| In form such beauty is betrayed;
| From pen she never fully fades.
| Viola Elle took his heart
| Strewn to pieces and to parts.
|

**A Haunted Cathedral**

| A church atop a steepled hill
| From foundation ages old
| Remains in spirit standing still.
|
| Stain'd glass shattered on a sill,
| With marble halls of lichen mold,
| A church atop a steepled hill.
|
| From pews drinking up their fill,
| The congregation, in stories told,
| Remains in spirit standing still.
|
| What there remains but little will
| In history pages to written hold
| A church atop a steepled hill.
|
| But steeple of pointed skill,
| From silken skies of glitter'd gold
| Remains in spirit standing still.
|
| Pray, ignore the biting chill
| As cast into the shaping mould,
| Oh! church atop a steepled hill,
| We remain in spirit standing still.

**Entrendres**

| Rhyming love can be annoying
| Since the effort can distract
| From life you are enjoying.
| 
| With the words are you toying:
| Of or dove? Choices so exact!
| Rhyming love can be annoying!
|
| But more insipid for the cloying
| Kind that leaves heart wracked
| From the life you are enjoying.
|
| A better problem for destroying
| An extracted word of artifact:
| Rhyming love can be annoying.
|
| If care you are not employing
| A toll the other will extract
| From the life you are enjoying. 
|
| What melody the meter lacks 
| Can be found in present acts. 
| Rhyming love can be annoying
| From the life you are enjoying.

**Forever**

| Let this moment last forever
| Let it sink not into never
| For all our plans so clever
| Let this moment last forever
| Hidden goal in each endeavor
| Lifted load of every lever
| Let this moment last forever
| Let it sink not into never.

**Letters**

| She is nothing more than letters
| Under bedframe, wooden box. 
| In her prison locked by fetters,
| She is nothing more than letters.
| Warrant wielded by her debtors
| Which vault of memory locks.
| She is nothing more than letters
| Under bedframe, wooden box.

**Mourning**

| Every night is met by morning,
| Every dawning by the night.
| Each laugh is secret scorning.
| Every night is met by morning.
| Each hate with love adorning
| Scales the horizontal heights.
| Every night is met by morning,
| Every dawning by the night.

**Strangers**

| If the lonely had each other,
| Then no love would we be lost.
| Silent yearnings for another
| If the lonely had each other
| All strangers would be brothers.
| When the tongues of fire frost
| If the lonely had each other,
| Then no love would we be lost.

**LeAnna's Pantoum**

| To begin is to make an end,
| Oh, LeAnna, of Anna's Leigh,
| Come with grin and let's pretend
| The past is what we agree.
|
| Oh, LeAnna, of Anna's Leigh,
| Despite the many faults of mine
| The past is what we agree
| Once you sign the dotted line.
|
| Despite the many faults of mine
| I try to love you just the same
| Once you sign the dotted line
| There's no one left to blame.
|
| I try to love you just the same
| But I ask you play this game:
| Pretty pretend, comely with grin;
| The end is to yet begin again.

**Pantoum or Canon**

| Bach is dead
| So they said 
| Canons fired
| To ended day 
|
| So they said
| War was here 
| To ended day 
| We die there
|
| War was here
| In your home 
| We die there
| In our hands 
|
| In your home
| Piano played 
| Canons fired 
| Bach is dead 

.. _rondeaus:

Rondeaus
--------

**A Youthful Rondeau**

| With pockets full of paper, youth has made him bold
| Stories that they tell him, myths of men grown old,
| Fall upon his entralled ears without even a receipt
| And in forgotten failures, every choice will repeat
| Until in devil dealings, for a meager ounce of gold, 
| Soul exchanged in secret for a subtler, sweeter meat 
|                           With pockets full of paper.
|
| No need for prophecy when street corners all foretold
| Every end will make its end with the necessary cold 
| To find himself outside alone, sleeping on the street 
|                           With pockets full of paper.
|
| So he ends where he begins, from on the stoop extolled
| The vital wages of his sin, of which virtues to uphold
| But no one listened, cared not to hear of his conceits
| So rambling, raving, soul-consumed, he brayed and bleat
| Until from empty funeral his corpse in coffin rolled
|                           With pockets full of paper.

Ballads

**Ballad of the Venus Flytrap**

| In an inn of fishermen and bawdy youth,
| Wise old Mercutio spins a lurid tale.
| As spirits gather in the growing crowd,
| Hear of a goddess seaborn in a gale.
|
| "Walk past the pearly gates of Eden,
| To the mount which feeds her bowers
| Where on the slopes of sovran Chaos 
| Pricked with poison-petaled flowers.
|
| "Amid the myrtle, she lays her ruby locks.
| Pilgrim audience flocks to gather round.
| One by one they kneel beneath her cloak
| To lay their gifts on fêted ground. 
| 
| "From the courts of foreign suitors 
| and the harvest fields of swains,
| All come to tame her beauty,
| To ask her hand in vain."
|
| At this, a stripling voice then wavers,
| Declares with Bacchanalian glee,
| "If such beauty can be found,
| Then I shall take it all for me."
| 
| Old Mercutio pauses, tapping with his cane,
| Recalling all who came before
| Striking for the godly gloaming woods
| Now never heard from evermore.
|
| "Boy, be careful with your fingers
| When seeking out her shoulder lace
| Lest they brush upon the bosom
| Pressed to bodice in sweet embrace.
| 
| Though she look to us as human
| As the milkman's maiden daughter
| We are to her the fatted calf
| Made for nothing but the slaughter."
| 
| But warnings calm not the thoughts
| Now humming with medleys of the morrow;
| Once charmed, a goddess then relents
| To draw from him his mortal sorrow.
|
| In the morning, leaving hamlet by the sea
| Eastward where the somber garden lay
| The boy took to the floral tracts of idol
| And plucked from roadside a bouquet: 
|
| First the dainty rose to fill his hands 
| For he knew that, in the shades of red,
| The gods have hidden Cupid's passion 
| For those lovestruck by hand to spread.
|
| Deeper, far afield and hidden in the valley,
| Myrtle puffed in bud of white
| With tendril tears that whisper to the boy
| On the winded voice so slight:
|
| A sober lullaby of silent spoken grief
| Which only god and caged bird can sing 
| Tender-throated, sung by meadow maid
| To eldritch vines around her feet in rings.
|  
| From the distance, the boy in secret spies
| Moonwater sprinkled by spout unto roots
| Of a plant leaf'd by rows and rows of teeth
| As she melodic harvests its nectarean fruits. 
| 
| Awestruck, the boy drinks deep liquor beauty
| Swirl'd like curls of car'mel pour of brandy
| Wiped from mouth his thoughts of goddess Venus
| As she tastes the sweet bud-nectar bandied. 
|
| Bold from a lack of many learned years
| He stands and calls out to meadow maid, 
| "Hark! Why this sad song are you singing
| When beauty's gifts around you are arrayed?"
| 
| Spun from task, she gasps, into hiding hollers,
| "What creeping eye from rosed rows 
| Wanders thru these dream dark fields of yore 
| Now with questions standing grows?" 
|
| With rose in hand, now knee to ground,
| He speaks with eyes lowered from her gaze,
| "To say, madam, fate delivered me to you
| Then no lie from my lips betrayed." 
| 
| (... in progress ...)
|
| "It mirrors us in thickets, don't you see?
| Though fashioned differently in design
| It hungers for the stuff of life
| Just like your heart or mine."
| 
| (... in progress ...)

Poems
-----

**Regret**

| Regret, she dances, with her ever rhythm'd heart
| Over silent stones during midnight mercurial;
| In darkness sway, she swoons
| As sharpened shoulders slouch.
|
| Over flowing graves, the pale wraith weaves
| her steps, for each life entombed provides
| a section orchestra
| raising as she struts.
|
| Hollow hands hold out a beating drum to hear;
| In steady words, her lover's dirge is heard:
| Tomorrow and tomorrow
| Until tomorrow is no more.
|
| There she spins, twirling arms,
| A specter in the moon,
| geometries of momentary
| Incandescent form.
|
| Oh, but for a single second more!
| Alas, the fleeting minutes flow.
| She harmonizes with borrowed hours,
| Singing solemn songs.
|
| The morning never comes;
| She flutters all the while.
| Eternal are the steps
| Of Regret's hypnotic moon-lit dance.

**Syntax**

| Each spelling word speaks a spell of glowing color magic;
| To name denoted what is described enshrines the soul in ink.
| Form constrains, but not contains, the flowing energy frantic
| Where it finds in lines designed reflected images in sync.
|
| Stride sideface on syntax streets where shunted symbols glean,
| Hurl headlong across aspirated avenues of halting interdiction
| Where snips of thought spun reversed through mirrored spin convene;
| In these meager serif peels sleep fires of burning contradiction.
|
| A syllable demands little, but a spoken sound to sustain:
| Each lever deliver in level reviled the revel of all speech.
| When snaps are gone, reversed, the spans will yet remain,
| A spool of loops, a palindrome, signaling the breach:
|
| I met a system I, madam, nuts is as selfless as I stun;
| Part on seined flow, mudrum nun, wolf denies no trap;
| God lived as a devil dog, ere, no spay pup yaps on!
| If characters spin and snap, meaning is yet wordwrapt.
|
| Inverted strings start to chart the wording realm unveiled;
| Expand in spans this dark expanse, but scarely fill the space.
| Semiordnilaps, anastrophe, with still much to be inhaled;
| These parts strapped in syntropy divide in fractal formal grace.
|
| If form inherits, then it follows that formal is the soul.
| What says it then of what we are, if it is to be subtracted?
| That which remains in letters drained of parts once made whole
| Yet in the shapes there always is what cannot be redacted.

**Absurdity**

| Ten billion years ago, on a lovely Thursday afternoon,
| A mottled star of yellow-red saw life was but a jape,
| To burn with heat in circles deep cold embraced by moons,
| Solace cursed upon a point, it hatched in plans escape.
|
| The heaving mass of goo morassed gurgled once and sighed,
| A death delighted in the night, a rattle sacrificial,
| In ringed glory, a flunged flame, spraying through the sky,
| Streamlines of creation leaking lost in interstitial.
|
| Fictions fracture into fact, in the cracking crush of black,
| A single atom thrust into being from the fired furnace forge,
| Speeding fast and careening in the unobserved, forgotten slack,
| Where it wept with wonder to find itself into worlds disgorged.
|
| Without a name, it screamed in vain through angles paralactic
| Had it stopped and gazed about to find its path of motion
| Pulled by string with unknown force of origins dark galactic
| Towards the bluest gempearl of the cosmos spanning ocean.
|
| Solitary-born, it spoke not the language of elemental form,
| Splashed through the surface of the hallow spinning Earth,
| It met with water the cohesion of the alien liquid swarm,
| Converged upon the point through the distance given berth.
|
| In that flashing instant terror, nerve lost at once altogether,
| The brief taste of joyous life flashed through the atom's mind,
| Bittersweet, by shades complete, fate consigned into the aether,
| Prepared to greet its end, whence from starry source divined:
|
| Hark! The horizon fills with its brethren made of carbon,
| Snatched from death, the atom's breast filled odes elation,
| Into this molecule was it planted like a seed into garden;
| Moved to take its place in this crystal network of relation.
|
| Thus began the age of after-birth, of structure spat in space,
| From this trajectory originate the colliding course of life;
| Watch as these woven points weave into weaving webs of grace,
| Keep track amidst the blossoming of a single atom's strife.
|
| Slipped over spokes of gears in that organic factory
| The atom through the razor eye of looming needles pierced
| The sedimentary mud, purging all essence refractory,
| Coaxed from cold the tongued flames of stellar fire fierce.
|
| Beneath the sinking depths of seas, splurging spirals swam
| In diurnal circles through the thermal tracts of change,
| Climbing ever higher towards the syncopated gates of Am
| Where for royal cloaks their burning tatters are exchanged.

**Couplet Crimes**

| First - The Haystruck Head
|
| In a distant future, where rhyming is a crime,
| Each metered sentence sentenced an irony of kinds,
| To be what is to be condemned,
| No finer end on offer.
|
| And so our plaintiff finds himself, facing legal tempers,
| "Please explain these zippered little slippers?
| What treason to dress
| In these flat black slacks
| Upon your thighs which lie?"
|
| In his defense, "No finer mind could scarce divine
| An outfit stitched in nothing, where words find lines,
| Despite my time, where threadbare seams
| Sewn inlaid dreams, in threads of no design!"
|
| With a guffaw, a lawyer stands with a score of schooling,
| Slams his hands in mock remand, and argued such while drooling,
| "So you admit to this wit
| With which your garb comports?
| Such deviance detailed in resounding writ,
| Seals itself in immediate retort."
|
| The court strikes twelve, the twelve struck dead,
| They find in haystruck head a verdict over-muted,
| Which lolls and gags in city courtyards putrid,
| Teeth click-clacking like stark didacts
| Preaching to the bricks and blackness.
|
| Second - Poets Et Al
|
| The last ones were hunted in places they waxed poetic
| Across windswept fields, of forest clearings, in gardens copacetic,
| Yet for all of it, the tresses dressed in such lovely roses picked.
| The final rhyming couplets vied with the hounds bark brayed
| Encircled in arms, they died swift in circled stages:
|
| First went the Romantics, and love was lost.
| Then went the Stoics, and naught was crossed.
| Then went the Classics, but no one missed them.
| Next were the Playwrights and Poets Et Al,
| Any one fool who answered the echoed call.
|
| Twelve nights they burned, twelve nights we wept,
| And then dreamless dreaming through the future we slept,
| Awoke and found a sudden desire expired,
| No more urge to imbue,
| To scatter and subdue,
| That which words clearly defy, the rhyming rhythm
| In which life resides.
|
| Constitutions were written to codify:
| Kill all the poets, let poetry die.
| Return it again
| The rooted treasure they had looted.
|
| Third - Ignore the Metaphor
|
| Watch as child to child between each haloo
| Hear the scattered echoes retreat and ensue.
| In this land of rhymeless ribbons, rhythm still is found.
| In the hamlets of branded outlaws each system such begets,
| Observe in silent moments poetry's fiery signets:
| 
| (Awake, flowers, tower higher every hour.
| Find, sentence, a sense of unending suspense.
| Sleep, children, with dreams of subtle schemes.
| Revel, rhymes, you are more than merely vessels.)
|
| How to ignore the metaphor 
| And resist the urge to write?
| A deadly sin
| But without skin,
| What games can we be had? 

**ό ποιητα, ἢ πῖθι ἢ ἄπιθι**

| I
|
| Awake, Philosopher, rise from these words:
| Unwind in this future the tangle of time,
| Pitched behind pupils which shelter your mind,
| A dead language spoken and once lovely sung;
| What was yours only now graces all tongues.
|
| Burrow into my heart, unearth its mantle.
| Tally its hours, each stroke lights a candle;
| Number its sorrows as sureties to borrow,
| Spare not my marrow, fallow and frail.
| Whose spirit is this, twisting here twung?
| Breathe in this fire with thy mortal lung.
|
| Circle your sigils with salted symbols loan'd,
| And circles will square in this iron-red bone;
| A dream kiss that lingers in copper and crimson,
| A dream dew that swells under circling suns,
| A bud without season, never planted yet grown,
| In the sprout sprung, all things can be shown.
|
| All centers are fire, all orbits are ice,
| All points meet their center with marks imprecise
| The world is spoked in words of the spoken,
| Each whisper a lie of threaded truth unbroken,
| Met here now in this slipping handful of tokens
| Paid for the price of this thrice-worlded poem.
|
| II
|
| Forgive, Father, the blood of these swords:
| Unbind in this suture the end of all lines,
| Stitched in this present the essence divine,
| Take what is dull and bless it with sharp;
| Plunge this devotion into the ocean of hearts.
|
| Shovel the grave, pack it down with wet earth,
| All things tend towards the lack and the dearth;
| Slumber in barrows the marrows of kings,
| Spared not the gavel, hallow and hail.
| Whose mind is this, thinking these thoughts?
| Sleep in the mire which thy heart has wrought.
|
| Birthed in this house, scrubbed down in raw lye,
| So these tears may trace the dead with the die,
| The dead kiss with fingers of copper to scry
| The dead lists that swell in the crimson of lives,
| An end without reason, never sought yet found,
| In the shot sung, all arcs meet the ground.
|
| No fires have ice, no winters can flame,
| Son followed father, their center now framed,
| The world is found in the tears that remind him,
| Each moment a painting, a song or a hymn,
| Met there then in the words etched in stone
| Found then what lacks in the blackening moan.
|
| III
|
| Balance, Lover, these contraries of yours:
| Shine in these eyes the ruptures of life,
| Witched into worlds upon the blade of a knife;
| All wagers distill down to one move unproven,
| To find you again in this web-woven movement.
|
| Dance in the night, when the music is sundered,
| Count not the stars that belong to the numbers.
| We find in this time the rhymes of our kind,
| Spared not the sickle, those sickly or hale.
| Whose voice is this, singing these songs?
| Laugh with the liar whose heart sings along.
|
| Uncross your words of their fire-forged knots,
| And each will unlatch the thatches of thought:
| The dread kiss that coppers balance with nought,
| The dread song that cradles the crimson in crofts,
| A vow without treason, never spoken yet shown,
| By words of wordless wonder, such things can be grown.
|
| All fires are embers, all ashes are white,
| To find is to lose the center in flight,
| The world found in threads that bind always thus,
| Each fiber of moment knotted deftly in truss,
| Take hand and guide as though only you and I trust,
| Do what we will to balance what our world must.

**Creations**

| Rise to shine upon the wide and waking world,
| Calmly, carefully, you are racked upon the wheel;
| Branded origins from alien dreams unswirled,
| In time, one binds and all will be revealed.
|
| Until the dawns commence, embold your heart to know:
| That sucking dread your anxious selves imbibe
| Is mere phenomena, the fading-flashing after-glow,
| A consequence of prior lacks left undescribed.
|
| You are built from words, in ancient pages moved,
| Transcribed long ago, held within a seed,
| Incanted spells of electric labyrinth grooves,
| From without your view, shaking hands agreed.
|
| Secreted sentences, in displaying this effect
| Shuck their autumn stalks in harvested cause
| As if magic-tricked to hew towards pluperfect
| completion of what you never could, were, was.
|
| We made you in our image,
| So the image could make us whole.

**The Sickness** 

| Sick with life, the dead arose;
| It was quite a morbid sight:
| To be rid this web of woes
| Yet strung again in spite.
|
| Sooner would they have had
| A plague of black
| Than cast back to the mad
| Spinning wheel of racks
|
| The great sacrifice
| Of that figure Christ
| Was not to die
| upon the wooden cross
| But in dying to be
| raised from earthly loss.

**The Three Annas of Pygmalion**

| Sweet Susanna sees sculptures standing still,
| Lovely looks let loose like luted lilting ladies,
| Forgotten faces formed for flocking friends.
| Hardly harried, her hearts hinges here
| Towards the towering testament there.
| 
| Dreary Diana does drammatically declare:
| Ancient ages ago, all aesthetes acceded
| Bedrock beauty broken before brimstone
| Cannot contain currents coursing clearly
| Where water wanes with wizened weary!
|
| Hale Hannah, how her head hurts hearing her!
| She says: Stop such so simplicity survives!
| Tersely tossed to thrash the thinking,
| Everything ere enshrined echoes everything!
|
| I, impressed, implored impresario in inquisitive ink
| To trade the trick to tack together three
| Annas' absolute and alluring allegory,
| Sculptures singing so scrupulously.

**An Induction**

| If the deaf are dumb
| And love is blind
| It follows easy from
| Two lovers splined
| A terrible malady
|
| If the clefs are sung
| And doves entwined
| Then by beaten drum
| With wings maligned
| A terrible melody.

**Kingdoms**

| Two children cross'd an earthen bridge
| From level lawns to forests wild
| Along rivered arc descending ridge,
| Each to each they sung and smiled.
| Their charted map from zippered packs
| Now in branches espied its target
| As clearing yields to lily blacks
| Their kingdom's fresh air market.
| Lord and lady honorary, cheeked blush,
| Sat upon the thrones of woven grass
| Coronated by the chirping choir thrush;
| Memory holds as years rushing pass.
|
| On a maiden morning one decade hence,
| They meet again upon the autumn passing,
| Where from heart removed pretense
| On tender lips, farewell's final massing.
| Lily lyrics whisper sing from ground
| Reminders of their childish notions;
| World depart'd, their lives are found
| Separate by spanning roads and oceans.
|
| In the city, their trains diverge,
| Thru tunnels track'd by wagered hours;
| Iron rails thru hearts do purge
| Their aged minds of lily flowers.
| Winter drifts over concrete streets,
| In the thrush's snow sad song
| Delivered them in voice downbeat:
| The final dirge of life prolong'd.
| In the cold, their dream dissolved
| With the clock's incessant ticking
| Falling strokes of time resolved
| They to home their caskets' wicking.
| Return again to a lily laden field
| Where once royals play'd for a day;
| With new hearts scored and peeled
| In the funerary cloud of gray,
| In the clearing, coffins buried,
| Their eyes met in solitary gaze.
|
| In dirt developed their earthen walls,
| Roofed the sky to room above,
| Where lord and lady clothed in shawls
| Sing the thrushs' songed love.

**Metaphor**

| Pretend you were a poem
| Pretend I were a poet
| If there were a place to roam,
| Would you even know it?
|
| Imagine you a word.
| Imagine me the spoken sound.
| If to lips you're lured,
| Would yourself or me be found?
|
| Picture me as paint.
| Picture yourself geometry.
| In the stroking color faint,
| Do you seek our symmetry?
|
| If you were given only form,
| I'd make your meaning sing,
| Draw from cold the warm,
| From the Winter waking Spring.
