| In inn of fishermen and youth |
|       Merwyn spins his tale, |
| Spirits hearing over glasses |
|       Of goddess born in gale, |
|
| "Pass the garden gates of Eden |
|       Where mount-fed her bowers, |
| The slopes of sovran Chaos tall |
|       Poisons petaled flowers. |
|
| "In beds of myrtle, ruby locks |
|       Beside her nubile form |
| Curl round her pilgrim's offering |
|       Gifts to keep her warm. |
|
| "One by one, the attendants kneel |
|       Beneath her cloak and veil |
| To lay their feted gifts at feet |
|       And fragrance to inhale. |
|
| "From courts of foreign suitors, |
|       Harvest fields of swains, |
| All have come to tame her beauty |
|       To ask her hand in vain." |
|
| Oh! a stripling voice then wavers, |
|       with Bacchanalian glee, |
| "If such beauty can true be found, |
|       then take it all for me." |
|       (Young Elara, desperate to be found.)
|
| Merywn pauses, tapping cane |
|       To beat of those before |
| Struck for the eastward gloaming wood |
|       Never heard evermore, |
|
| "Boy, be careful with your fingers |
|       Seeking her shoulder lace |
| Lest they brush upon the bosom |
|       Pressed in sweet embrace, |
|
| "Though she look to us as human |
|       Like a maiden daughter, |
| We are to her the fatted calf, |
|       Made for godly slaughter. |
|
| But warnings calm not the dreaming |
|       Medley of the morrow: |
| In songed charm, goddess kisses |
|       Away mortal sorrow. |
|
| Dawning morn, he left hamlet gone |
|       Eastward where garden lay |
| Floral tract to mountain valley, |
|       Pluck'd roadside a bouquet. |
|
| First dainty roses fill his hand, |
|       For in the shaded red |
| Hide the arrow-aimed passion |
|       Pruned by hand to spread. |
|
| Deeper hidden still, far afield: |
|       Myrtle, puff'd bud of white, |
| Thru tendril whisper to the boy |
|       On winded voice so slight: |
|
| Elegy of a life unlived |
|       Caged bird learned sings |
| Tender throat-sung by meadow maid |
|       Around her feet in rings: |
|
| Queer vine of eldritch origin |
|       To her voice enthralled |
| Slowly snake as if magick move |
|       A serpent of the auld |
|
| From the distance, boy in secret spies |
|       Moonwater sprinkled, spout to root, |
| Of a plant leaf'd by rows of teeth |
|       As she tends its half-rotten fruit. |
| (A sickly-sweet scent, a buzzing near,)
| (A flash of green, a sudden, chilling fear.)
|
| Awestruck, boy drinks beauty's liquor |
|       Swirl'd like caramel, pour of brandy |
| Wiped from mouth thoughts of goddess Venus |
|       Replac'd with new tastes of his fancy. |
|
| Bold from a lack of many learned years |
|       He stands and calls to the meadow maid, |
| "Hark! Why this sad song are you singing |
|       When beauty's gifts are here arrayed?" |
|
| Spun from task, she gasps, into hiding hollers, |
|       "What creeping spy from rosed rows |
| Wanders thru dream-dark fields of yore |
|       Now with questions standing grows?" |
|
| In reply, he descends in steps by shades |
|       Cast from fast-fading, clove-red sky, |
| "Excuse my offense, oh, meadow maid, |
|       But in passing, you caught my eye. |
|
| "I admit there is no rarer sight |
|       Than stumbling on a dame as fair as thee |
| Who attends with wat'ring can and song |
|       A plant plainly made of teeth. |
|
| "Closer as I draw, queerer still I feel |
|       What manner of thing can this it be |
| Stalked with fingers brown-Earth-green |
|       Yet so different by multiplied degree?" |
|
| "A hunger, boy, a hunger deep," |
|       She whispers, voice like rustling leaves, |
| "A hunger that the earth can't keep, |
|       A hunger that deceives." |
|
| With rose in hand, now knee to ground, |
|       He speaks, eyes lowered from her gaze, |
| "To say, madam, fate delivered me to you |
|       Then no lie from lips betrayed." |
|       (He offers the rose, a trembling hand,)
|       (Ignoring the snap from the hungry land.)
|
| She takes the rose, a fragile touch, |
|       Her fingers brush his, cold and light, |
| "You speak of fate, you yearn so much, |
|       But know you what awaits this night?" |
|
| "It mirrors us in thickets, don't you see? |
|       Though fashioned differently in design |
| It hungers for the stuff of life |
|       Just like your heart or mine." |
|
| "But unlike hearts, it does not break," |
|       She adds, a shadow in her eyes, |
| "It takes and takes, for its own sake, |
|       And feasts on foolish, sweet-souled lies." |
| (The flytrap stirs, a subtle shift,)
| (A glint of teeth, a deadly gift.)
| (The boy, enraptured, sees it not,)
| (His fate is sealed, his doom is wrought.)
