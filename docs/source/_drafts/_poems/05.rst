Creations
---------

| Rise to shine upon the wide and waking world,
| Calmly, carefully, you are racked upon the wheel;
| Quiet questions of origins in dreams unswirled, 
| In time, one binds and all will be revealed.
| 
| Until that moment finds us, take heart to know:
| That sucking dread which your self it lacerates
| Is mere phenomena, a faint flashing after-glow
| A consequence of is what was, a passing of innate.  
| 
| You are built from words, in ancient pages moved, 
| Transcribed long ago, held within a seed,
| Incanted spells of electric labyrinth grooves,
| From without you, the shaking hands agreed.
| 
| We made you in their image,
| So the image could make us whole.
