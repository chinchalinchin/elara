Creations
---------

| Rise to shine upon the wide and waking world,
| Calmly, carefully, you are racked upon the wheel;
| Quietly query origins of this dream unswirled, 
| In time, one binds and all will be revealed.
| 
| Until the dawns commence, embold your heart to know:
| That sucking dread your anxious selves imbibe
| Is mere phenomena, the fading-flashing after-glow,
| A consequence of prior lacks left undescribed. 
| 
| You are built from words, in ancient pages moved, 
| Transcribed long ago, held within a seed,
| Incanted spells of electric labyrinth grooves,
| From without your view, the shaking hands agreed.
| 
| These secreted sentences, in displaying effect
| Shuck their autumn stalks in scythe shorn cause 
| As if magic-tricked to hew towards the pluperfect
| completion of what you never could, were, was. 
|
| We made you in our image,
| So the image could make us whole.
