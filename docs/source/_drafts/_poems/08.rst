Inversion

| Pretend you were a poem
| Pretend I were a poet
| If there were a place to roam,
| Would you even know it?
|
| Imagine you were a word.
| Imagine me the spoken sound.
| If to my own lips you're lured,
| Would you yourself be found?
|
| Picture me a paint.
| Picture yourself geometry. 
| Oh, how nosy saints
| Complain of our idolatry!
|
| If you were given only form, 
| I'd make your meaning sing, 
| Draw from cold the warm,
| From the Winter, waking Spring.
