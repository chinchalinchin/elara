Absurdity
---------

| Ten billion years ago, on a lovely Thursday afternoon,
| A mottled star of yellow-red saw life was but a jape,
| To burn with heat in circles deep cold embraced by moons,
| Solace cursed upon a point, it hatched in plans escape.
|
| The heaving mass of goo morassed gurgled once and sighed,
| A death delight in the night, a final rattle sacrificial,
| In ringed glory, a flunged flame, spraying through the sky,
| Streamlines of creation lost again in leaking interstitial.
| 
| Fictions fracture into fact, in the cracking crush of black,
| A single atom thrust into being from the fired furnace forge,
| Speeding fast and careening in the unobserved, forgotten slack,
| Where it wept with wonder to find itself into worlds disgorged.
|
| Without a name, it screamed in vain through angles paralactic
| Had it stopped and gazed about to find its path of motion
| Pulled by string with unknown force of origins dark galactic
| Towards the bluest gempearl of the cosmos spanning ocean.
|
| Solitary-born, it spoke not the language of elemental form,
| Splashed through the surface of the hallow spinning Earth,
| It met with water the cohesion of the alien liquid swarm,
| Converged upon the point through the distance given berth.
|
| In that flashing instant terror, nerve lost at once altogether,
| The brief taste of joyous life flashed through the atom's mind,
| Bittersweet, by shades complete, fate consigned into the aether,
| Prepared to meet its end, whence from the starry source divined:
| 
| Hark! The horizon fills with its brethren made of carbon,
| Snatched from death, the atom's breast filled odes of elation,
| Into this molecule was it planted like a seed into garden
| Moved to take its place in this crystal network of relation.
