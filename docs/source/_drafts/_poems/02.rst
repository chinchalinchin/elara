Absurdity
---------

| Ten billion years ago, on a lovely Thursday afternoon,
| A star of mottled red concluded life was but a jape,
| To burn with heat in circles deep through the cold embrace of moons,
| Solace cursed upon a point, it hatched in plans escape.
|
| The heaving mass of goo morassed gurgled once and sighed,
| A death delightful like no other, its final rattle sacrificial,
| In ringed glory, a flunged flame, spraying through the sky,
| In gory din, all creation lost again in leaking interstitial.
| 
| Fictions fracture into fact, in the cracking crush of black,
| A single atom thrust into being from the fired furnace forge,
| Speeding fast and careening in the unobserved, forgotten slack,
| Where it wept with wonder to find itself in worlds disgorged.
