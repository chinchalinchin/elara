Kingdoms
--------

| Two children cross'd an earthen bridge
| From level lawns to forests wild
| Along rivered arc descending ridge, 
| Each to each they sung and smiled.
| Their charted map from zippered packs
| Now in branches espied its target 
| As the clearing yields to lily lacs
| Their kingdom's fresh air market.
| Lord and lady honorary, cheeked blush, 
| Sat upon the thrones of woven grass,
| Coronated by the chirping of the thrush;
| This memory holds as years rushing pass. 
|
| On a maiden morning one decade hence,
| They meet again in season passing,
| Where from heart's removed pretense
| On tender lips, farewell's final massing.
| Lily whisper lyrics sing from ground,
| Reminders of their childish notions,
| World depart'd, their lives are found 
| Separated by spanning roads and oceans. 
|
| In the light, their dream dissolves
| With the clock's incessant ticking
| Falling strokes of time resolved,
| They to home their heels are clicking. 
| Return again to a lily covered field
| Where once royals played for a day, 
| With new hearts scored and peeled, 
| In the funerary cloud of gray,
| In the clearing, coffins buried,
| Their eyes met in solitary gaze.
|
| In dirt developed their earthen walls,
| Roofed the sky to room above,
| Where lord and lady clothed in shawls
| Listen to thrushs' songed love.
