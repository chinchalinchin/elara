A company manufactures model rockets that require igniters to launch. Once an igniter is used to launch a rocket, the igniter cannot be reused. Sometimes an igniter fails to operate correctly, and the rocket does not launch. The company estimates that the overall failure rate, defined as the percent of all igniters that fail to operate correctly, is 15 percent.

A company engineer develops a new igniter, called the super igniter, with the intent of lowering the failure rate.

To test the performance of the super igniters, the engineer uses the following process.

    Step 1: One super igniter is selected at random and used in a rocket.
    
    Step 2: If the rocket launches, another super igniter is selected at random and used in a rocket.

Step 2 is repeated until the process stops. The process stops when a super igniter fails to operate correctly or 32 super igniters have successfully launched rockets, whichever comes first. Assume that super igniter failures are independent.

	a. If the failure rate of the super igniters is 15 percent, what is the probability that the first 30 super igniters selected using the testing process successfully launch rockets?

	b. Given that the first 30 super igniters successfully launch rockets, what is the probability that the first failure occurs on the thirty-first or the thirty-second super igniter tested if the failure rate of the super igniters is 15 percent?

	c. Given that the first 30 super igniters successfully launch rockets, is it reasonable to believe that the failure rate of the super igniters is less than 15 percent? Explain.

At an archaeological site that was an ancient swamp, the bones from 20 brontosaur skeletons have been unearthed. The bones do not show any sign of disease or malformation. It is thought that these animals wandered into a deep area of the swamp and became trapped in the swamp bottom. The 20 left femur bones (thigh bones) were located and 4 of these left femurs are to be randomly selected without replacement for DNA testing to determine gender.

	a. Let X be the number out of the 4 selected left femurs that are from males. Based on how these bones were sampled, explain why the probability distribution of X is not binomial.

	b. Suppose that the group of 20 brontosaurs whose remains were found in the swamp had been made up of 10 males and 10 females. What is the probability that all 4 in the sample to be tested are male?

	c. The DNA testing revealed that all 4 femurs tested were from males. Based on this result and your answer from *part b*, do you think that males and females were equally represented in the group of 20 brontosaurs stuck in the swamp? Explain.

	d. Is it reasonable to generalize your conclusion in *part c* pertaining to the group of 20 brontosaurs to the population of all brontosaurs? Explain why or why not.

Sunshine Farms wants to know whether there is a difference in consumer preference for two new juice productsâ€”Citrus Fresh and Tropical Taste. In an initial blind taste test, 8 randomly selected consumers were given unmarked samples of the two juices. The product that each consumer tasted first was randomly decided by the flip of a coin. After tasting the two juices, each consumer was asked to choose which juice he or she preferred, and the results were recorded.

	a. Let *p* represent the population proportion of consumers who prefer Citrus Fresh. In terms of *p*, state the hypotheses that Sunshine Farms is interested in testing.

	b. One might consider using a one-proportion z-test to test the hypotheses in part *#a*. Explain why this would not be a reasonable procedure for this sample.

	c. Let X represent the number of consumers in the sample who prefer Citrus Fresh. Assuming there is no difference in consumer preference, find the probability for each possible value of X. Record the x-values and the corresponding probabilities in the table below.

A machine at a manufacturing company is programmed to fill shampoo bottles such that the amount of shampoo in each bottle is normally distributed with mean 0.60 liter and standard deviation 0.04 liter. Let the random variable **A** represent the amount of shampoo, in liters, that is inserted into a bottle by the filling machine.

	a. A bottle is considered to be underfilled if it has less than 0.50 liter of shampoo. Determine the probability that a randomly selected bottle of shampoo will be underfilled. Show your work.

	b. After the bottles are filled, they are placed in boxes of 10 bottles per box. After the bottles are placed in the boxes, several boxes are placed in a crate for shipping to a beauty supply warehouse. The manufacturing company's contract with the beauty supply warehouse states that one box will be randomly selected from a crate. If 2 or more bottles in the selected box are underfilled, the entire crate will be rejected and sent back to the manufacturing company. The beauty supply warehouse manager is interested in the probability that a crate shipped to the warehouse will be rejected. Assume that the amounts of shampoo in the bottles are independent of each other.

		i. Define the random variable of interest for the warehouse manager and state how the random variable is distributed.

		ii. Determine the probability that a crate will be rejected by the warehouse manager. Show your work.

	c. To reduce the number of crates rejected by the beauty supply warehouse manager, the manufacturing company is considering adjusting the programming of the filling machine so that the amount of shampoo in each bottle is normally distributed with mean 0.56 liter and standard deviation 0.03 liter. Would you recommend that the manufacturing company use the original programming of the filling machine or the adjusted programming of the filling machine? Provide a statistical justification for your choice.

A test consisting of 25 multiple-choice questions with 5 answer choices for each question is administered. For each question, there is only 1 correct answer.

	a. Let :math:`\mathcal{X}` be the number of correct answers if a student guesses randomly from the 5 choices for each of the 25 questions. What is the probability distribution of :math:`\mathcal{X}`?

This test, like many multiple-choice tests, is scored using a penalty for guessing. The test score is determined
by awarding 1 point for each question answered correctly, deducting 0.25 point for each question answered
incorrectly, and ignoring any question that is omitted. That is, the test score is calculated using the following
formula.

	Score = (1 x number of correct answers) â€“ (0.25 x number of incorrect answers) + (0 x number of omits)

For example, the score for a student who answers 17 questions correctly, answers 3 questions incorrectly, and omits 5 questions is

	Score = (1 x 17) - (0.25 x 3) + (0 x 5) = 16.25.
	
Use this information to answer the following questions.

	b. Suppose a student knows the correct answers for 18 questions, answers those 18 questions correctly, and chooses randomly from the 5 choices for each of the other 7 questions. Show that the expected value of the studentâ€™s score is 18 when using the scoring formula above.

	c. A score of at least 20 is needed to pass the test. Suppose a student knows the correct answers for 18 questions, answers those 18 questions correctly, and chooses randomly from the 5 choices for each of the other 7 questions. What is the probability that the student will pass the test?

4. **The Empirical Rule**

Since the Z-Table is the cumulative distribution function for the Standard Normal distribution, The :ref:`empirical-rule` can be derived through a Z-table. Recall the :ref:`empirical-rule` states,

.. topic:: Empirical Rule

	Approximately 68% of a distribution is within one standard deviation of the mean.
	
	Approximately 95% of a distribution is within two standard deviations of the mean.
	
	Approximately 99% of a distribution is within three standard deviations of the mean.
	
This can be stated more precisely in terms of the **Z** distributions as follows,

.. topic:: Empirical Rule (Mathematical Version, z Distributions)

	.. math::
		
		P(-1 \leq \mathcal{Z} \leq 1) = 0.68
	
	.. math::
		
		P(-2 \leq \mathcal{Z} \leq 2) = 0.95
		
	.. math::
		
		P(-3 \leq \mathcal{Z} \leq 3) = 0.99

The *Empirical Rule* is an approximation, meant for quick calculations. It is not exact, as you will soon discover.

	a. Use a :ref:`z-table` to find the exact value of :math:`P(-1 \leq \mathcal{Z} \leq 1)`
	
	b. Use a :ref:`z-table` to find the exact value of :math:`P(-2 \leq \mathcal{Z} \leq 2)`
	
	c. Use a :ref:`z-table` to find the exact value of :math:`P(-3 \leq \mathcal{Z} \leq 3)`
