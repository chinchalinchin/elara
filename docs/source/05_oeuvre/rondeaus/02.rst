III: Roundels of Remembrance
----------------------------

| I 
|
| This photograph of strangers' joy,
| In garbage can, though torn in half,
| Its glossy eyes through time enjoy 
|   this photograph. 
|
| Imagine tears that joyous laugh,
| The Autumn gowns and corduroy,
| A wedding banquet monograph.
|
| With age then mixed precise alloy
| From parts romance and epitaph,
| Til future hands at last destroy
|   This photograph.
|
| II
|
| Graffitied walls of yearly bloom,
| With vagrant spray of aerosols
| The vapors fume, condensed to groom
|   graffitied walls. 
|
| The artists follow protocols:
| the lover's name, the prophet's doom,
| the epigraphs of homeless sprawls.
|
| The rarer buds of sweet perfume
| Are hidden deep in alley malls
| Where flowered faces wrapped entomb
|   graffitied walls. 
|
| III
|
| The laces sewn across the back
| Will lacerate through depths to bone.
| The body scars along the track
|   The laces sewn. 
|
| Despite the ache, the blanket grown 
| From knit of severed fiber slack
| Is warm enough to wrap alone.
|
| Yet laces loop, return as flack,
| As generations forced atone
| And learn by hand which loom to rack
|   the laces sewn.
