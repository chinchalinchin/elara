II: Rondeau for the River Rats
------------------------------

| On river shore the poor in tents are stored
|    To keep from sight their score.
| Above and north, the city steeples meet
| To speak in sermons ever indiscrete
|     for sheep they so ignore.
|
| They fight with roar, yet beaten, kiss through gore;
| From barrel fired dream, north they look for more,
| The city lights too far a source of heat
|    For life on river shore.
|
| In winter months they paint on skin a whore,
| And every one despite what silence swore.
|     In life they all must cheat,
|     Become their own conceit,
| To win a war for land they all abhor:
|     Their home on river shore.
