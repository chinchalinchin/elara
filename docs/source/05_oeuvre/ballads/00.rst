| the island formed where rivers meet,
| where silt in vortex fords.
| the place emerged, the brokered seat, 
| the land of met accords.
| 
| amassed a mount that breached the air 
| with flair to reach the ear
| of kingdoms come to loyal swear
| an oath all must adhere. 
| 
| the sky, the sea, the mountain crags
| that vie on fronts opposed,
| beneath the fountain planted flags, 
| agreed to plans proposed.
|
| the barren hump, the sodden deal,
| the flocking birds with plow
| of gullet seed, to letters leal
| the court of wings their vow. 
| 
| the shoots are sunk and water sewn
| through roots of flooded banks
| where mudded flanks of fish cyclone
| the scaly studded ranks. 
| 
| the trees then stake foundations firm,
| cement what's broken free, 
| confirm the fluke to bring to term
| the squawking newborn plea.
|
| at last the summer yields to life
| and summons forth its words
| to open market pastures rife
| with bounty born by birds.
|
| the jubilee of june, july
| through fallow leas by moon,
| the rodents swoon in cups of rye 
| and fall to bed too soon.
|
| for autumn comes with heavy rain 
| to test the borders drawn.
| the water drains from level plain,
| in flooding rose the dawn.
|
| what muddy lanes then sluice the drowned
| debris and sweep from field
| The tumbling tumult, turned aground
| and heaped by waves to wield.
|
| so inch by inch the tides reclaim
| the island kingdom keep
| and cast it down without a name
| to swirling depths of sleep.
| 
| yet down below, the stones make schemes
| through skipping, streaming chunks
| inlaid by sunken trees these seams
| as ballast for their trunks.
| 
| arise the turret towers stark
| against the ruddered land 
| to touch the ceiling shuttered dark
| and brace what sprawling spanned. 
|
| beneath the surface flowers form
| as shades of algae grow
| atop the castle walls in swarm,
| the borough made to glow.
|
| let winter freeze, with crystal glass,
| behold submerged the fast,
| alive with dancing ghosts en masse
| retreading paths now past. 
|
| when spring returns the tides recede,
| but hollow urns are filled. 
| the ashes spurned by snaking weed
| take root when fields are tilled.
