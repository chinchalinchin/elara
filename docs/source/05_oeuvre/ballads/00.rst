Spring
------

March 
#####

| The island formed where rivers meet,
|   where silt through vortex fords.
| The place emerged, the brokered seat, 
|   a land of met accords.
|
| Amassed a mount that, breaching air, 
|   declared to reaching ear
| of kingdoms: come and loyal swear
|   the oath all must adhere. 
|
| So March the army sorties cease,
|   embarking east and west 
| to mark the chartered pact with peace,
|   obeisance paid and blessed.
| 
| Here troops of fish in lunar quests
|   compare to mirrored twins
| above the starry minnowed crests
|   where haloes map to fins.
|
| Behold the treaties signed in ink,
|   the scrolls in future's brine,
| the sutures binding swords in sync
|   to island's hallow shrine.

April
#####

| Let Spring not linger such affairs,
|   for sight betrays its songs. 
| A web of compromise ensnares
|   the spidered plotting throngs. 
|  
| The April session clauses creep
|   and wolves with sharpened claws,
| deceived by strategems of sheep,
|   retract their motioned laws.  
|
| But blurting rams befoul the ploy,
|   with filibuster bleets
| that break the still the ewes enjoy;
|   the argument repeats.
|
| So galleries of gulls forestall
|   the rabble squalls of wind
| with wisdom born of current's drawl
|   so steel resolve will bend. 
|
| The Sky, the Sea, the Mountain crags
|   that vie on fronts opposed,
| beneath the fountain planted flags 
|   agreed to plans proposed.

May
###

| A barren hump for sodden meal
|   so pecking farmers plow
| their gullet seed, the lettered deal
|   for courts of wings a vow.
|
| The shoots are sunk and water sewn
|   through roots of flooded ranks
| where mudded flanks of fish cyclone
|   around the studded banks. 
| 
| A retinue arrives from sea
|   atop a snow-white bull.
| Its royalty with one decree
|   begins the reign in full.
|
| The trees then stake foundations firm,
|   cement what's broken free, 
| confirm the seed to bring to term
|   the squawking newborn plea.
|
| May birth announced to kneeling crowds
|   on consecrated Earth,
| a seal pronounced beneath the clouds
|   with celebrated mirth.

Summer
------

June
####

| The stellar swans of Summer dawn
|   survey the dwelling streets,
| in flight adorning downward drawn,
|   the morning island greets.
| 
| Dispersing plumes of pheromone
|   converge at silent points.
| Diverging tracts from season grown 
|   lead back where June annoints.
|
| At last the season bursts with life
|   and summons forth its herds
| to open market pastures rife
|   with bounty born by birds. 
|  
| In shallows deer appear to graze
|   beside the lazing drapes
| of rays, the incandescent haze
|   that veils their swaying shapes.
|
| Then maiden buds unfold to bees 
|   their sweetly nectared heat;
| unladened, drowsy, through the breeze,
|   the teasing fumes secrete. 

July
####

| Soft underfoot the cancers snap
|   entrapped by stupored hordes,
| reluctant shells stampeded wrap
|   the island shore restored. 
|
| Along the flowing inlet streams 
|   the festival begins.
| Caressing music tinges dreams
|   with cricket violins.
|
| The gondolas of lillies' bud
|   that carry courting toads
| through swampy bogs to ports of mud
|   relieve their tadpole loads.
|
| Oh! Jubilee, this boon, July
|   through fallow leas by moon,
| when rodents swoon in cups of rye 
|   and fall to bed too soon.
|
| Amid the revelry a kiss
|   to memory's delight,
| two larks alight in fading bliss
|   fulfill this final night. 

August
######

| What bittersweet perfumes release
|   in looming throes of age,
| when isle matures through orange cerise, 
|   engulfed in scents of sage.
|
| Though leonine its roar in youth,
|   the shedding source of mane
| replies with veins of blood vermouth
|   through suffocating grain.
|
| Of August lines that empire grew,
|   once cloaked in ermine garbs,
| unkempt and molting, flake sinew,
|   their branches wreathed in barbs.
|
| Though riches hide in golden limb,
|   the leaves dissolve to dust,
| consoled in wind to hushing skim
|   what wealth remains in gust. 
|
| Discretely cloaked from time the Fall
|   of secret reign's decline
| through crimson's spectrum vine, all
|   gone brown, forgetting shine.

Autumn
------

September
#########

| September storms suspend the skies
|   resplendent morning pinks
| above the waking window eyes
|   despairing foregone winks. 
| 
| What ears of wheat will balance scales? 
|   What maiden disappears? 
| Condensing answers dance in gales,
|   ascending hemispheres.
|
| Now Autumn comes with heavy rain 
|   to test the borders drawn.
| The water drained from level plain
|   in flooding rose the dawn.
|
| The thunder heralds sundered age 
|   besieged by droplets fat 
| with blood of yearly plundered wage, 
|   enraged what Spring begat.  
|
| What muddy lanes then sluice the drowned
|   debris and sweep from field
| the tumbling tumult, turned aground
|   and heaped by waves to wield.

October
#######

| October chopping peaks depressed
|   through interlocking weeks
| deplete reserves that Summer stressed
|   to balking vassal shrieks. 
|
| Retreating columns' sullen flight,
|   deserting homes and kin, 
| the fleeing wash through rapids white
|   with waters steeped in sin.
|
| So inch by inch the tides reclaim
|   the island kingdom keep
| and cast it down without a name
|   to swirling depths of sleep.
|
| The atlas page is ripped anew,
|   schematic contour holes
| where once there rose a sprout to blue
|   now rising streams of souls. 

.. crabs should come back here as a sort of revenge
November
########

| Yet down below, the stones make schemes
|   in skipping sprees like drunks,
| inlaid in sunken trees through seams
|   as ballast for their trunks.
| 
| Arise the turret towers stark
|   against the ruddered land 
| to touch the ceiling shuttered dark
|   and brace what sprawling spanned. 
|
| Beneath the surface flowers form
|   as shades of algae grow
| atop the castle walls in swarm,
|   the borough glade aglow.
|
| November's embers burn a while
|   between the exiled graves.
| Remembered nocturnes sung beguile
|   the damned, forgottten knaves. 

Winter
------

December
########

| A rending gale begins to blow
|   above where worlds still thrive.
| Descending sickles diving slow
|   as primal ends arrive.
|
| Let Winter lens of crystal glass
|   behold submerged the fast,
| alive with dancing ghosts en masse
|   retreading paths now past. 
|
| The stasis holds in cold command 
|   the surface wraiths at play. 
| They turn to gems, encased expand
|   beyond the skinned decay. 
|
| Absolved December center breaks, 
|   dismembered lattice links,
| upending states, revolving wakes;
|   the idle spirit shrinks. 

January
#######

| Through sieging vortices of shard
|    the kingdom yard is cleaved.
| Bombarding sheets of ice discard
|    in circles ruins sieved.
|
| What moments held in spells now spent
|   impels the course of freeze.
| The towers brought to knees repent,
|   now felled by Time's disease.
|  
| The afterlife morassed in cracks
|   of marrow twisted blue,
| the wighted bones of zodiacs
|   imbued with pallid hue.
|
| So seconds pass eternally,
|   this January clock.
| The island keep returns to sea
|   through grains of sand to chalk.

February
########

| Yet February always brings 
|   the forest chorus lines,
| the chirping chickadee that sings 
|   from luted bows and vines. 
|
| From south, the scouting vees of geese,
|    with probes of swiveled neck
| that follow fronts of warmth's caprice,
|    are promise-held in check.
|
| When Spring returns the tides recede,
|   but hollow urns are filled. 
| The ashes spurned through snaking weed
|   reset when fields are tilled. 
|
| The angel beaks of birds baptize
|   the dirt in streaking aisle.
| The cycle arcs in sharp reprise:
|   the ballad of the isle.
