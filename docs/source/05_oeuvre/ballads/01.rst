II: The Mad Ballad of Sad Cracked Jack
--------------------------------------

| The question beggars even now
|   For answers we still lack.
| No one has ever said the how
|   Of what that cracked our Jack.
|
| He woke that day and heard the song
|   That framed his steps with beat, 
| The meter stick that smacked along
|   Behind his fuzzled feet. 
|
| At first he thought he dreamt the verse,
|   These words you read unfold.
| But when he thinks the thoughts recurse
|   And seep through pages' mold. 
|
| Aghast he jolts and cries aloud, 
|   "What trickster plays these tricks?"
| Then shocked to find his speech endowed
|   with stresses timed to ticks.
|
| Alas, if Jack had only known 
|   the furies fate had loosed--
| "What furies now?" He says with groan,
|   replies to rhymes reduced. 
|
| What fatal flaw entrapped this man?
|   "I'm just an office clerk!"
| But boredom orchestrates a plan
|   no human born can shirk.
|
| In boxer briefs, he stumbles out,
|   Escapes from bed to hall,
| And every inch he runs to rout
|   The rhythm's faster call. 
|
| In morning light, the very sight 
|   Of frantic Jack alerts
| The neighborhood to pending blight
|   The verse in line asserts.
|
| "Oh, neighbors, please, receive my plea!
|   There's something very wrong!"
| He cries with gasp from bended knee,
|   "I only speak in song!"
|
| A single friend then steps on stage,
|   Carissa, two doors down,
| With eyes that meant to calm, assuage,
|    Distorted by her frown,
|
| "Jack? What the hell is going on? Are you okay?"
|
| At that our Jack is taken back,
|   Her voice as clear as glass
| With not a hint of verse to track
|   Through mazes long and crass.
|
| "How can it be!? An ask so free
|   While I to scheme conform!
|  This diction sweeps anastrophe,
|   Mosaics teeming swarm!"
|
| Madame Carissa, missus made 
|   to fill the damsel role,
| the unsuspecting victim played
|   to ballad's very goal. 
|
| She kneels to him and whispers soft,
|   a voice as slick as cane,
| the kind that beats, not sweet but waft
|   to strike the skin with pain. 
|
| "Are you on drugs or something?"
|
