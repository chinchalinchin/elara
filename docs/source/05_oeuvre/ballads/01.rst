II: The Mad Ballad of Sad Cracked Jack
--------------------------------------

| The question beggars even now
|   For answers we still lack.
| No one has ever said the how
|   Of what that cracked our Jack.
|
| He woke that day and heard the song
|   That framed his steps with beat, 
| The meter stick that smacked along
|   Behind his fuzzled feet. 
|
| At first he thought he dreamt the verse,
|   These words you read unfold.
| But when he thinks the thoughts recurse
|   And seep through pages' mold. 
|
| Aghast he jolts and cries aloud, 
|   "What trickster plays these tricks?"
| Then shocked to find his speech endowed
|   with stresses timed to ticks.
|
| Alas, if Jack had only known 
|   the furies fate had loosed--
| "What furies now?" He says with groan,
|   to rhymes replies reduced. 
|
| What fatal flaw entrapped this man?
|   "I'm just an office clerk!"
| But boredom orchestrates a plan
|   no human born can shirk.
|
| In boxer briefs, he stumbles out,
|   Escapes from bed to hall,
| And every inch he runs to rout
|   The rhythm's faster call. 
|
| In morning light, the very sight 
|   Of frantic Jack alerts
| The neighborhood to pending blight
|   The curse this line asserts.
|
| "Oh, neighbors, please, receive my plea!
|   There's something very wrong!"
| He cries with gasp from bended knee,
|   "I only speak in song!"
|
| A single friend then steps on stage,
|   So named to fit the bill,
| For names are fate and fettered wage,
|   They called her lovely Jill. 
| 
| "Jack? What the hell is going on? Are you okay?"
|
| At that our Jack is taken back,
|   Her voice as clear as glass
| With not a hint of verse to track
|   Through mazes long and crass.
|
| "How can it be!? An ask so free
|   While I to scheme conform!
|  This diction sweeps anastrophe,
|   Mosaics teeming swarm!"
|
| She kneels to him and whispers soft,
|   A voice as slick as cane,
| The kind that beats, not sweet but loft
|   To strike the skin with pain. 
|
| "Are you on drugs or something?"
|
| Now Jill, this dame, the missus made
|   To fill the damsel role,
| The unsuspecting victim played
|   To ballad's very goal.
|
| These words are met with wide-eyed stare
|   As Jack realized his plight;
| He hears the lines designs prepare,
|   the ending rhymes invite. 
|
| "Oh, listen, Jill, and listen well!"
|   He takes her hand in his, 
| "These words that flow are not a spell,
|   They simply are what is! 
|
| "I hear the force that crack the shapes
|   incessant stresses bind!"
| He cries as crowds surround to gape
|   at madness here enshrined. 
| 
| "I see," She nods, but doesn't see, 
|   but picks him up to walk,
| "Perhaps," She says, "It's time to flee,"
|   and hauls our Jack in shock.
|

|
| (... Jill discovers talking in verse allows her to affect the course of the ballad ...)
|
| "This useless English Arts degree
|   I never thought to use,
| It's purpose clear, we both agree,
|   Was always to deduce
|
| The curse of verse that flirts with us
|   And save you from its worst
| But first I need the tools to suss
|   The course to be reversed,"
|
| Abrupt she stands with coat in hand, 
|   "The library!" She cries, 
| "We need some Keats, that Ginsberg banned,
|   The lessons they advise!"
|
| (... in progress ...)
