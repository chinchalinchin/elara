The Mad Ballad of Sad Cracked Jack
----------------------------------

| The question beggars even now
|   For answers always lack.
| No one has ever said the how
|   Of what cracked old sad Jack.
|
| He woke that day and heard the song
|   That framed his steps with beat, 
| The meter stick that smacked along
|   behind his fuzzled feet. 
|
| At first he thought he dreamt the verse
|   these words you read unfold.
| But when he thinks the thoughts recurse
|   and seep through pages' mold. 
|
| Aghast he jolts and cries aloud, 
|   "What trickster plays these tricks?"
| And shocked to find his speech endowed
|   with stresses timed to ticks.
