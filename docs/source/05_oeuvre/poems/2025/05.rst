VI: Kingdoms
------------

| Two children crossed an earthen bridge
| From level lawns to forests wild
| Along the rivered arc descending ridge.
| With dirty hands, they sang and smiled.
| Their charted map from zippered packs
| Now in branches espied its target
| As clearing yields to lily blacks
| Their kingdom's fresh air market.
| Lord and lady honorary, cheeked blush,
| Sat upon thrones of woven grass,
| Coronated by chirping choir thrush;
| A falling grain in hourglass. 
|
| On a maiden morning moments hence,
| They meet again upon the autumn passing,
| Where from heart's removed pretense
| On tender lips, farewell's final massing.
| Lily lyrics whisper sing from ground
| Reminders of their childish notions;
| World departed, their lives are found
| Separate by spanning roads and oceans.
|
| In the city, their trains diverge,
| Through tunnels tracked by wagered hours;
| Iron rails through hearts do purge
| Their aged minds of lily flowers.
| Winter drifts over concrete streets,
| In the thrush's snow sad song
| Delivered them in voice downbeat
| The final dirge of life prolonged.
| In the cold, their dream dissolved
| With the clock's incessant ticking
| Falling strokes of time resolved,
| They follow home a casket's wicking,
| Returned again to a lily covered field
| Where once royals played for a day;
| With new hearts scored and peeled
| In the funerary cloud of gray,
| In the clearing, coffins buried,
| Their eyes met in solitary gaze.
|
| In dirt developed their earthen walls,
| Roofed the sky to room above,
| Where lord and lady clothed in shawls
| Sing the thrushs' songed love.
