VI: Kingdoms
------------

| Two children crossed an earthen bridge
| From level lawns to forests wild
| Along rivered arc descending ridge, 
| With dirty hands, they sang and smiled.
| Their charted map from zippered packs
| Now in branches espied its target 
| As clearing yields to lily blacks
| Their kingdom's fresh air market.
| Lord and lady honorary, cheeked blush, 
| Sat upon the thrones of woven grass,
| Coronated by the chirping choir thrush;
| Memory holds as years rushing pass. 
| 
| On a maiden morning one decade hence,
| They meet again upon the autumn passing,
| Where from heart removed pretense
| On tender lips, farewell's final massing.
| Lily lyrics whisper sing from ground
| Reminders of their childish notions;
| World departed, their lives are found 
| Separate by spanning roads and oceans. 
| 
| In the city, their trains diverge,
| Thru tunnels tracked by wagered hours;
| Iron rails thru hearts do purge 
| Their aged minds of lily flowers. 
| Winter drifts over concrete streets,
| In the thrush's snow sad song
| Delivered them in voice downbeat
| The final dirge of life prolonged. 
| In the cold, their dream dissolved
| With the clock's incessant ticking
| Falling strokes of time resolved,
| They follow home a casket's wicking, 
| Returned again to a lily laden field
| Where once royals played for a day;
| With new hearts scored and peeled 
| In the funerary cloud of gray,
| In the clearing, coffins buried,
| Their eyes met in solitary gaze.
|
| In dirt developed their earthen walls,
| Roofed the sky to room above,
| Where lord and lady clothed in shawls
| Sing the thrushs' songed love.
