II: The Mid-Winter March
------------------------

| At twelve when I woke up, the ground was dry.
| Around one, it started snowing.
| By four, the roads were slush
| and the town was hushed.
| When I went to the liquor store at 7:12,
| the streets were filled like store shelves
| Waning silhouettes 
| limping like zombies
| towards the liquor store.
| The mid-winter march
| of alcoholism
| like the stalwart journey
| of the emperor penguins
| in the freezing wastelands
| of Antarctica.
| I go inside and
| get my fifth of vodka
| pack of cigarettes
| bag of peanuts
| and say my prayers
| at the counter of clerks.
|
| The sky
| falls to the ground
| in the muted silence of
| a winter's night.
