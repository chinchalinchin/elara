III: The End
------------

| The pavement tide recedes
| and the brick and mortar beaches 
| expose the fault lines of the City. 
|
| This town will one day sink into the ground
| and Nature will reclaim its property. 
| We will pluck berries from vines 
| growing up the sides of office complexes
| and erect deerskin tents on the shattered blacktop.
| We will dance around bonfires,
| chanting songs sung to the soul of everything
| and tell stories about the formation of stars,
| the teardrops of goddesses frozen in the sky.
| The forest will whistle with wind
| and billboards will be painted over with the faces of totems,
| the ink distilled from the buds of flowers.
