XII: The Curse of Rain
----------------------

| The rainy days, so slandered, weep
| As haughty summer lovers lay
| And mock the sky with lazy sleep,
| While clouds so white with dreams of gray,
| With sun they soak and whirling sweep
| In hidden furies' winded spray.
|
| Each time it rains, the rivers splay,
| And surge with purging currents swift,
| What lays on shore is swept away
| Through undertow then set adrift
| To reach again where edge gives way
| To core laid bare through ancient rift.
|
| The heat was shaped with holy bliss,
| While cold finds form in shattered fall,
| The tracks of arcs that never miss,
| The purpose found in roaring squall,
| To hurl in spite of stolen kiss,
| To seed with life this earthen sprawl.
|
| No forest sprite nor sun born sprout,
| Can know the course of water's fate,
| To craft and make then cease the drought,
| And hear its name with venom hate
| In curses made by summer's clout,
| And so it cries at heaven's gate.
