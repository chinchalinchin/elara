XIII: Let It Simmer
-------------------

| A heart too hot will lack a taste
| Refined. Quiet now, simmer down,
| And stew the sauce, or let it baste.
| Yes, let it sit, in flavor drown
| And only then when flame is off,
| You taste a bit, a smidgen pinch;
| Before your hunger dips to trough,
| Begin to measure inch by inch
| What boiled over side of thought.
| Distilled to stock, the essence clean
| Will cling in drops that drip on pot
| To add to future meals' cuisine.
