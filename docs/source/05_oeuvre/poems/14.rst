XV: Incantations
----------------

| crooked cross on steeple slants
| behind the clouds on axis bound.
| cocoon your storm with sorcelled cants,
| this spell from depths of godless sound.
|
| the dirge is purged through broken bell,
| the hollow dell with surging wind,
| unearthed remains returned from hell,
| the bones decayed now gardens tend.
|
| oh, name that hides in shattered ring,
| that brings the rain, becomes the night
| of lightless thunder, shriven sing
| the drops of dark through wicked flight.
|
| by dripping altar, prayers pled
| with clasping fingers splayed in maze,
| communed with spirits past and dead,
| before my eyes, the sightless gaze.
|
| the paint of statues leeched in stains,
| with weeping ink of saint's remorse,
| deformed by time and bearing chains,
| condemned to hear my voice grown hoarse.
