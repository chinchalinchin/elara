VIII: Walls
-----------

| the husks of walls that city shucks
| accumulate, conglomerate
| around like rings in ancient trunks
| where measured age with circles gate
| the spiraled line accrued through time,
| deposits buried in substrate.
|
| at summit's crest, the joints are thick
| and licking tongues of moss ascend
| the darkened stone from quarry hauled
| on shouldered back, in arms suspend
| the garden court where crowds took root
| and grew their plans of walls to tend.
|
| then moving out, the bricks of red
| in crooked rows descend to meet
| the lanes of carriage tracts now black
| and scorched with tar in shapes of street
| where crimson dust from crumbled walls
| in dancing twirls across concrete.
|
| next grey cement of molded squares
| in towers stacked to portal sky
| with wires fused and humming signs;
| they arc and rise, on edges vie
| like vines entwined in rushing growth
| that split and fray their nuclei.
|
| at last the stable struts of steel
| designed as straight as rays of light
| reflected back on silver glass
| the lattice links both left and right
| the course of time in circled sweep,
| constricts the city sphere so tight.
