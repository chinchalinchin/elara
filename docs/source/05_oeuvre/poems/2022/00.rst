Mephisto and God
----------------

| Mephisto
| 
|	All of these mysteries that you claim to keep,
|	the learned below spurn to regard so little;
|	Whose outline yet drapes the wide world entire
|	enforcing a silence before their tongues inquire. 
|
|	The faithful doth put their heads to sleep,
|	rest assured in dreams of their souls' acquittal. 
|	Trembling and awed, even the learned agree:
|	Life has a price, because it's not given for free. 
|
|	In moments of agony and madness unique,
|	Even the heart of the heathen cries out your sickle.
|	For every human heart has a lack that you built,
|	One that you filled with bottomless guilt. 	
|
|	I, Mephisto, am not cowed by your mystique.
|	Your promises ring hollow, your words always brittle.
|	I am your equal and I know the truth
|	Though it requires not even a sleuth. 
|
|	I'd wager all there is a greater leap,
|	a question that for all you are is still a riddle;
|	That when You created Man, You rolled the dice,
|	Cut from His rib and then rolled it twice.
|
| God
| 
| 	The question you pose is one of chance.
|	Whether I, being God, act in ways uncertain?
|	What saith you when my answer breaks tooth?
|	Would you believe it then or need further proof?
|
|
| Mephisto
|
|	So my argument you doth admit and advance!
|	Let us climax this play now towards its curtain:
|	Tell me true here now there is no plan
|	All is chaos for a width without span.
|
|
| God 
|
|	You march on ahead without my question sated. 
|	I ask you again: what proof you require?
|	The price of this knowledge is paid full in faith,
|	not a theorem of words strung to show so you saith. 
|
|
| Mephisto
|
|	In circles, you talk! Oh, how I hate it! 
|	Instead of answers, you endlessly suspire!
|	If you seek to confound, so that I might falter and cease
|	Then you've misplaced another bet on my unfounded caprice! 
|
| God
|
|	Free will was a gift not lightly bestowed.
|	The answers you seek would ruin the surprise. 
|	A light that illumines always a shadow destroys
|	So what was in the darkness, in light avoids.
