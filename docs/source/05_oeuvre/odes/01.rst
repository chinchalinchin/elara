II: Ode to the Heron
--------------------

| Grey Heron, sing the song that cold winds bring.
| When hunting ground defers
|       From fronts of blue to ice,
| The grunting geese spur south
|       And warmth through wing is wove
| As moles in burrowed shunts
|       Prepare beside the mice.
| The deer too disappear
|       In hidden dreaming cove.
| Who lingers longer than the Winter king?  
|
| All yield, retreat and leave their claims till Spring.
| Oh! Heron! All but one!
|       Not you, oh hunter Grey!
| Stalk low on drift of snow
|       With coiled neck of spear
| To rouse the sleeping beasts
|       And reaping, feast on prey.
| Let steam their gasping breath
|       With scream of rasping fear.
| Sans snow, what muffled sound on streams would ring?
|
| The weather warms, yet Winter lifts your wing.
| In flocking song most birds
|       Find mate to take to nest;
| Your silent stare beside
|       The rushing river bank,
| Your chorus sung in swoop
|       With fire from thumping chest,
| The pumping flame that spurns
|       The burning cold on flank.
| The feathers swarm, but lone to cold you cling.
|
| Each season makes of life its shape to sling.
| The Spring so molds the buds
|       And lazy chirping thrush,
| The Summer, berry red
|       And cracking eggs of fay,
| Then Autumn crows of black
|       In pecking pumpkin brush,
| Yet Winter makes but one,
|       The mighty Heron Grey.
