II: Ode to the Heron
--------------------

| Grey Heron, sing the song the winds will bring.
| Who lingers longer than the Winter king?  
| When hunting ground returns
|       Through fronts of blue to ice,
| The moles in burrowed urns
|       Prepare beside the mice
| As grunting geese will veer
|       Where churning warmth is drove,
| The deer all disappear
|       In dreary dreaming cove.
|
| All yield, retreat and leave their claims till Spring.
| Through fields, what muffled name on streams will ring?
| The answer sweeps from east--
|       Oh! Heron! Hunter Grey! 
| Cry! Rouse the sleeping beast
|       And reaping, feast on prey!
| Creep low on drift of snow
|       With coiled neck of spear;
| Let steam of gasping slow
|       Their rasping scream of fear.
|
| The weather warms, yet Winter lifts your wing.
| The feathers swarm, but lone to cold you cling.
| In flocking song most birds
|       Find mate to take to nest;
| Let chorus part the herds
|       With fire from thumping chest,
| Your pumping flame that spurns
|       The burning cold on flank.
| Your silent stare discerns
|       The creatures left on bank.
|
| Each season makes of life a shape to wring.
| Each reason born in strife escapes to sing. 
| The Spring first strings the thread
|       Of lazy chirping thrush,
| The Summer, berry red
|       And cracking eggs in brush,
| Then Autumn crows of black
|       In pecking pumpkin hay.
| Only a lonely lack
|       Breeds mighty Heron Grey.
|
| When night descends, take stock of everything.
| What hidden home should find you nuzzling?
| What branches bear your weight?
|       Whose feathers stroke your beak?
| No human eyes await
|       The colony's mystique. 
| The shrieking calls coalesce
|       Atop the forest heights,
| In alien address
|       The flame inside ignites.
