II: Dementia
------------

| remember now before the future fades, 
| the sutured minutes of memories held,
| records replayed as grooving sound degrades,
| advancing echoes, music notes dispelled. 
| 
| the sutured minutes of memories held:
| now twirling dance, oh younger selves, entrance
| advancing echoes, music notes dispelled
| through silent waltz compelled by passing glance. 
|
| now twirling dance, oh younger selves, entrance
| with candled spells of woven hands that grasp
| through silent waltz compelled by passing glance
| of eyes reshaping moulds, the fated clasp. 
| 
| with candled spells of woven hands that grasp
| relapsing moments sung by bells and crowds
| of eyes, reshaping moulds the fated clasp 
| of past refrains now sealed beneath the clouds. 
|
| relapsing moments sung by bells and crowds
| concealed by crumbling walls, demented shades
| of past refrains now sealed beneath the clouds
| that clutter skies in swarms that stretch decades.
|
| concealed by crumbling walls, demented shades
| invade the hollowed mind, their scream pervades
| records replayed as grooving sound degrades;
| remember now before the future fades.
