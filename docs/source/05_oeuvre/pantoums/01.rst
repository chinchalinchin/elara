II: Dementia
------------

| remember now before the future fades, 
| the sutured minutes moments tender held,
| records replayed as grooving sound degrades,
| advancing echoes, furtive notes dispelled. 
| 
| the sutured minutes moment splintered held:
| now twirling dance your younger self in trance,
| advancing echoes, furtive notes dispelled
| through silent waltz compressed by happened stance.  
|
| now twirling dance, your younger self, entrance
| with handled spells of sundered hands, the gasp
| through silent waltz, come pressed by happenstance
| of eyes reshaping moulds, the fated clasp. 
| 
| with hand led spells of sun-red hands that grasp
| relapsing moments sung by bells, oh crowds
| of eyes, reshaping moulds the fated clasp 
| of past refrains now sealed beneath the clouds. 
|
| relapsing moments sung by bellowed crowds
| concealed by crumbling walls, demented shades
| of past refrains now sealed beneath the clouds
| of cluttered skies, the swarms that stretch decades.
|
| concealed by crumbling walls, demented shades
| (remember now before the future fades)
| invade the hollowed mind as scream pervades
| records replayed as grooving sound degrades.
