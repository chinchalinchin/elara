I: You as a Sonnet
------------------

| Should your hand force from mine a single choice
| To compare our love to a tome of lore,
| A summer day, rose, moon, or chorus voice,
| Just one spans your width, oh, the metaphor.
|
| You are as the as from the like to like,
| The circle stretching from each pole to pole.
| You are the lack between the shriek and shrike,
| The parts which string in thought your essence whole.
|
| Awake, I cannot be but to find you
| In empty room, in meadow or in dream;
| You are the point of every moment true,
| Gem inlaid by plan into every scheme.
|
| So if this choice to me tonight you bring
| I shall choose to make of you everything.
