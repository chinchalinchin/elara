III: A Sonnet for Cumberland MD
-------------------------------

| Bay silt in city stone through time accrues
| along the western course of concrete flow
| that sweeps from plain to sky in upward spews
| as grey-white spray arcs over wave to snow
| from heights on high and splash on mountain spine
| where valleyed pools in rising drink their fill
| and shoot with sprouts through shoulders made of pine
| the roofs that empty crowds on streets and spill
| through hand to hand the layers stacked from base
| to wedded brick til building lillies bred
| against the westward wall in flood's embrace
| where lips at last are wet in watershed;
|
| Let skyline mark where tide in climb was broke:
| Steeple, roof, needles pine and leaves of oak.
