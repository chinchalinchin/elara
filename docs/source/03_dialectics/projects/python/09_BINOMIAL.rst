Instructions
============

1. Download the *csv* dataset in the :ref:`project_nine_dataset` section and place it in the ``Linux Files`` folder on your folder system where you save your ``.py`` scripts.
2. Create a Python ``.py`` script named ``LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_project_nine.py`` in your ``Linux Files`` folder on your file system. You can do this by opening an IDLE session, creating a new file and then saving it. Replace ``LASTNAME`` and ``FIRSTNAME`` with your last and first name, respectively.
3. Create a :ref:`docstring <python_docstring>` at the very top of the script file. Keep all written answers in this area of the script.
4. Read the :ref:`project_nine_background` section.
5. Read the :ref:`project_nine_loading_data` section.
6. Load in the data from the ``.csv`` file using the technique outlined in the :ref:`project_three_loading_data` section.
7. Perform all exercises and answer all questions in the :ref:`project_nine_project` section. Label your script with comments as indicated in the instructions of each problem.
8. When you are done,zip your script **and** the *csv* file in a zip file named ``LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_project_nine.zip``
9. Upload the zip file to the Google Classroom Project Four Assignment.
