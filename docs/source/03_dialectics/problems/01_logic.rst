Propositions
------------

1. **Truth Tables**

Construct a :ref:`truth table <truth-tables>` to determine if the following symbolic propositions are tautologies, contradictions or contingencies.

	a. TODO 

	b. TODO

	c. TODO

	d. TODO

2. **Carnap's Method**

Use :ref:`carnaps-method` to determine if the following symbolic propositions are tautologies, contradictions or contingencies.

	a. TODO
	
	b. TODO
	
	c. TODO
	
	d. TODO

	a. TODO
	
	b. TODO
	
	c. TODO
	
	d. TODO
	
	e. TODO

Aristotle's Square of Opposition
--------------------------------

.. hint::

	For the following problems, find an interpretation of the given proposition that obtains truth in the real world.
	
	For example, in the first problem, let 
	
		A ~ The set of humans
		
		B ~ The set of mammals
		
	Then the proposition *"All things which are A are also B"* becomes *"All humans are also mammals"*. This will make interpretting the subsequent propositions easier!
	
1. Suppose the proposition *"All things which are A are also B"* is true. Determine the :ref:`truth-values <truth-values>` of the following propositions, if possible. 

	a. *"No things which are A are also not B"*
	
	b. *"All things which are not A are also not B"*
	
	c. *"No things which are B are also A"*
	
	d. *"Some things which are not B are also A"*
	
	e. *"Some things which are not A are also B"*
	
2. Suppose the proposition *"No things which are A are also B"* is true. Determine the :ref:`truth-values <truth-values>` of the following propositions, if possible.

	a. *"Some things which are not B are also not A"*
	
	b. *"All things which are not A are also not B"*
	
	c. *"No things which are not A are also not B"*
	
	d. *"Some things which are not B are also A"*
	
	e. *"All things which are not B are also not A"*
	
3. Suppose the proposition *"Some things which are A are also B"* is true. Determine the truth-values of the following propositions, if possible.

	a. *"All things which are A are also not B"*
	
	b. *"Some things which are A are also not B"*
	
	c. *"No things which are B are also A"*
	
	d. *"Some things which are B are also A"*
	
	e. *"No things which are A are also not B"*
	
4. Suppose the proposition *"Some things which are A are also not B"* is true. Determine the truth-values of the following propositions, if possible.

	a. *"All things which are A are also not B"*
	
	b. *"Some things which are A are also not B"*
	
	c. *"No things which are not A are also B"*
	
	d. *"No things which are not B are also A"*
	
	e. *"Some things which are B are also A"*
