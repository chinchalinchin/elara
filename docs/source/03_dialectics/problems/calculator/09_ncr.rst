NCR: Combinations

Introduction
============

The number of combinations ï»¿is defined as the number of ways ``r`` objects can be selected from ``n`` objects, where order is not important. The number of combinations can be calculated using the following formula,


.. math:: 

	C(n,r)  = \frac{n!}{(n-r)! \cdot r!}
	
It is important to note the sequence of letters *ab* and *ba* would be considered the same combination of the objects *a* and *b*. This is in distinction to *permutations*, where *ab* and *ba* would be considered distinct sequences because *a* and *b* appear in different orders. In fact, there is a connection between the number of permutations and the number of combinations of *r* objects selected from *n* objects.

From the formula, notice :math:`C(n,r) = \frac{P(n,r)}{r!}`, or rewriting, :math:`r! \cdot C(n,r) = P(n,r)`. In other words, for a given combination :math:`C(n,r)` of ``r`` objects, we need to permute this combination :math:`r!` times to account for all the different ways the ``r`` objects can be *ordered*.

Calculator
==========

.. topic:: Factorial

	To calculator a permutation on a *TI-83/84* calculator, type in the following commands,
	 
	- :math:`\text{BUTTON}: \text{MATH}`
	- :math:`\text{MENU}: \text{PRB}`
	- :math:`\text{3}: \text{NPR}`

.. warning::

	On the the *TI-83s* and the older model *TI-84s*, you must first type in ``n``, the numbers of objects from which you are selecting, then insert a **NCR** function, and finally ``r``, before executing the function. In other words, if you have 10 objects and you want to know the number of ways you can choose 2 of them where order does not matter, you would type into the main screen,
	
.. code::

	10 NCR 2
