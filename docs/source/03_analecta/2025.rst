A perfect palindrome is symmetric, a mirror image of itself no matter which way it is written. Of the types of palindromes, they are likely the most rare, because their grammatical conditions are so stringent, at least as far as English is concerned. 

Perfect palindromes mostly hinge on invertible grammatical structures embodied in the "*on-no*", "*now-won*" and "*saw-was*" invertible pairs. Without these invertible pivot points, a perfect palindrome must rely on the symmetry of a central palindromic word. 

In other words, the cardinality of perfect palindromes is related to the cardinality of invertible words and the cardinality of purely reflective words. 

- repel on no leper
- dog saw raw war was god
- gateman now won nametag
- snoops now won spoons
- pupils did slipup
- strips deified spirits

Compare these examples to a case like "*borrow or rob*" which, while palindromic, does not preserve its semantic content under inversion.

    Where but to think is to be full of sorrow

    -- *Ode to a Nightingale*, John Keats

One stares at a blank page, trying to catch a thought. They are so many, slick and spastic, slipping from the nets like an uncatchable bounty. Every waking moment is an unending deluge of associations, like time were weaving you from accidents of coincidence. Here now the clinical smell of vinyl, pressed then into the mold of the past, where it finds again its origin in the threads of car seats your father showed you how to sew. A memory seared in a pan flash. Then, the waxy flesh of a holly leaf, sharp edges and spindly limbs, crunching in the forest. There, in the valley, forts and kingdoms only the minds of children can map.

There is no direction to the soul. It is unanchored, everywhere at once. A thought is not something that happens in order, in sequential time. It curls back on itself, becomes its own source. 

This is what words seek to capture. The labyrinth of self in which one is lost. To find the words, one searches in circles, placing words to mark the course you have travelled. And each word carves out its corner, whittling down the heaping mass of thoughts, until all that remains, encircled by words, is a fragment of what originally stood. Words are like a sieve, filtering out the particulars, stripping them of experience.

And yet, words are the only weapon we are permitted to wield in the war into which we have been drafted without consent. To speak is to breach a vault with a battering ram. A word is a revolution, a blade wielded against the isolation that defines being.
