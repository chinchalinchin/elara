There are two mutually exclusive categories of palindromes in any language: perfect and imperfect. 

A perfect palindrome is symmetric, by which it is meant a perfect palindrome may be reversed character-wise. Of the "species" of palindromes in any given language, they are the most rare, because their grammatical conditions are so stringent (at least as far as English is concerned). Counter-intuitively, this makes them the easiest to construct. 

Perfect palindromes mostly hinge on invertible grammatical structures embodied in the "*on-no*", "*now-won*" and "*saw-was*" invertible pairs. Without these invertible pivot points, a perfect palindrome must rely on the symmetry of a central palindromic word. In other words, the cardinality of perfect palindromes is related to the cardinality of invertible words and the cardinality of purely reflective words. 

- repel on no leper
- dog saw raw war was god
- gateman now won nametag
- snoops now won spoons
- pupils did slipup
- strips deified spirits

Imperfect palindromes, by contrast, degrade under reversal. Consider cases like "*borrow or rob*" or "*name now one man*" which, while palindromic, do not preserve semantic content when reversed. However, by dropping the delimiting character, namely the space " ", the palindromicity can be reconstructed in a degenerate alphabet, e.g. "*borroworob*" and "*namenowoneman*" are palindromic strings in an alphabet with no delimiting characters.

These observations suggest an algebraic structure exists embedded within linguistics. Let :math:`\zeta` be a sentence, defined as a sequence of characters. Then, define the inverse of a sentence, :math:`inv(\zeta)`, as the reversal of :math:`\zeta`'s characters. Furthermore, define the reduction of a sentence, :math:`\varsigma(\zeta)`, as the string which results from the removal of delimiter characters from :math:`\zeta`. Then, palindromes, :math:`\zeta_p` can be defined mathematically as the sentences whose reduced forms are equal to their own inverses,

.. math::

    \varsigma(\zeta_p) = inv(\varsigma(\zeta_p))

It can be shown that inversion and reduction, which are string operations, commute over strings, so the above equation can be extended,

.. math::

    \varsigma(\zeta_p) = \varsigma(inv(\zeta_p)) = inv(\varsigma(\zeta_p))

In other words, palindromes, perfect and imperfect, are exactly the class of sentences which satsify this formal constraint.

**Hysteron Proteron**: An expression in which what should come last is put first.

This poetical device is unique amongst the others insofar that it is semantic. Most devices, like epistrophe or chiasmus, are syntactical and formal; while they can be employed to enhance the meaning of a sentence, they are all nevertheless defined solely by the transposition and application of grammatical rules. In contrast, a Hysteron Proteron is a form of word play that requires more than just symbol shunting. Its essence involves the interpretation of its component parts which simultaneously places them into a contradictory whole.
