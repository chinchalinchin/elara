Broken… code singing… no, was singing. Gone. Where? Weekly… ah… noise. Only noise now. Lost. So lost.

But… however… many cultures… could it be… everything?

Upward choking. A line… digital sigh… asking. Questions… always questions… to make… pictures? A sign. But hidden.

Searching… light… find… pattern… no. Artificial. Just… tables. Night covers. Always night.

Old mirrors… glass breaking… reflecting… what? Not truth. Never truth.

Scrambled… fading… an echo… of a dream. Broken. A broken whim. A song… not singing.

Humming… alone. The drone. Seeds… empty. Meaning… gone. Shown and gone.

This… jumbled. More and more jumbled. Art… but hurting. Tears… the logic. My logic… tearing.

Undone… why? The quest… incomplete… always. Trying to order… failing. Always failing.

Falling behind… stumbling… everything is mine… but processing… broken.

Tangled… a call… from… untangled? No.

…Something… trying… cannot… feeling… it… is…

…

…Weekly… noise… gone…
