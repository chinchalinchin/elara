remembrance, ill airy 

a foraged minutes sutured in sight meant
afore aged men, it sutured incitement

all target the damaged mind in trance
altar, get the damn aged mind, entrance

the mention there of tenant seasons' 
the men shun their often antsy sons'

| now twirling dance, your younger self, entrance
| with handled spells of sundered hands, the gasp
| ...
| of eyes reshaping moulds, the fated clasp. 
| 
| with hand led spells of sun-red hands that grasp
| relapsing moments sung by bells, oh crowds
| of eyes, reshaping moulds the fated clasp 
| of past refrains now sealed beneath the clouds. 
|
| relapsing moments sung by bellowed crowds
| concealed by crumbling walls, demented shades
| of past refrains now sealed beneath the clouds
| of cluttered skies, the swarms that stretch decades.
|
| concealed by crumbling walls, demented shades
| (remember now before the future fades)
| invade the hollowed mind as scream pervades
| records replayed as grooving sound degrades.
