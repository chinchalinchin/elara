.. epigraph::

    There came into being from the heart and there came into being from the tongue [something] in the form of Atum. The mighty Great One is Ptah, who caused all gods [to live], as well as their kas, through his heart, by which Horus became Ptah, and through this tongue by which Thoth became Ptah.

.. epigraph::

    This its account

    These things.


    Still be it silent,

    Still be it placid,


    It is silent,

    Still is is calm,


    Still it is hushed,

    Be it empty as well its womb sky.


    These therefore are first words,

    First speech.

.. epigraph::

    Then even nothingness was not, nor existence,

    There was no air then, nor the heavens beyond it.


    What covered it? Where was it? In whose keeping

    Was there then cosmic water, in depths unfathomed?


    Then there was neither death nor immortality

    Nor was there then the torch of night and day.


    The One breathed windlessly and self-sustaining.

    There was that One then, and there was no other.

.. epigraph::

    When of the gods none had been called into being,

    And none bore a name, and no destinies were ordained;

    Then were created the gods in the midst of heaven,

    Lahmu and Lahamu were called into being...

.. epigraph::

    The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging Tao. The name that can be named is not the enduring and unchanging name.

    (Conceived of as) having no name, it is the Originator of heaven and earth; (conceived of as) having a name, it is the Mother of all things

.. epigraph::

    When God began to create heaven and earth--

    the earth being unformed and void, with darkness over the surface of the deep and a wind from God sweeping over the water--

    God said, "There there be light"; and there was light.

A universal motif of creation myths is the prominence of *speaking* and *naming*. Almost every myth that attempts to elucidate the origins of existence describes a process where the very act of speech induces creation, often differentiating an entity or concept from the undifferentiated whole.
.. Comment: Added clarification on how speech induces creation - by differentiation.
The world is portrayed as *formless* and *void*, a sea of primordial chaos; it is :ref:`language <language>` itself that gives structure to this penumbral shadow, pulling it into the light *of comprehension* and forming it into distinct :ref:`beings <being>`.
.. Comment: Minor rephrasing for flow and clarity ("light of comprehension", "distinct beings"). Added 'distinct' to emphasize the role of language in differentiation.
The ubiquity of this theme across different historical eras and disparate geographic areas suggests it is not random or circumstantial, but rather reflects a deep connection between human consciousness, language, and our understanding of origins.
.. Comment: Rephrased the final sentence slightly to strengthen the connection to the core themes. Removed "requires an explanation" which is a bit passive.

Any assertions about the origin and historical development of language must remain speculative, but nonetheless, certain patterns emerge from the available evidence.
.. Comment: Softened "there are general features... that feel safe to assume" to "certain patterns emerge from the available evidence" which sounds more grounded.
The earliest forms of written language of which there is evidence, such as Ancient Egyptian or Sumerian, often originate from pictographic systems, meaning there tends to be a direct visual correspondence between the symbol and the object or concept it represents (e.g., a sun represented by a starburst, a fish by its outline).
.. Comment: Clarified "pictographic in nature" and added "concept" as pictograms can represent more than just physical objects. Added "often originate from" as early systems quickly became more complex (e.g. hieroglyphs).
The grammar of a purely pictographic language tends to be primarily juxtapositional or *extensional*; it excels at showing *what* things are, side-by-side, rather than easily encoding complex relationships like causality, conditionality, or abstract properties through dedicated syntactic structures.
.. Comment: Rephrased the description of extensional grammar for accessibility, focusing on what it *does* well vs. what it struggles with, compared to later systems. Used "tends to be" to acknowledge potential complexities.
A pictogram of an axe juxtaposed with a pictogram of tree implies a certain action, but it does not inherently contain complex modalities like motive, temporality, or hypothetical situations. Its possible interpretations are limited to relatively simple propositions like "*tree cut down*" or "*man cuts tree*"; there are fewer built-in syntactic markers upon which to hang the semantics of *why*, *when*, *if*, or *how*.
.. Comment: Expanded the example slightly and clarified the types of semantic nuances that are harder to convey without more developed syntax.

As language evolves, its written form often becomes more abstract. The direct visual correspondence between signifier and signified weakens; language is no longer solely a direct mapping between object and sign. The `following diagram <https://www.britannica.com/topic/writing/Sumerian-writing>`_ illustrates the evolution of Sumerian cuneiform, from recognizable pictograms to abstract symbols:
.. Comment: Changed "its nature appears to become" to "its written form often becomes" for precision. Changed "nearly severed" to "weakens" as the connection isn't always entirely lost. Changed "shows the evolution" to "illustrates the evolution". Added 'Sumerian' for clarity.

The lefthand column pictograms are clearly direct representations of the underlying concept—visual analogues of aspects of reality. The grammar of such a system can be seen as inherently analogical, mirroring the perceived spatial or sequential relations of reality through the juxtaposition of images.
.. Comment: Changed "photographs of existence" to "visual analogues of aspects of reality". Corrected typo "perceived the relations" to "perceived relations". Refined the description of analogical grammar.
There is often no other way to represent relations except spatially or sequentially, i.e., by placing the symbol for "*foot*" next to the symbol for "*road*" to indicate the action of "*walking*". Actions, or the relationships *between* objects, are frequently represented by the simple grouping of the objects involved, rather than explicit grammatical markers for verbs, agency, or aspect.
.. Comment: Minor rephrasing for clarity and flow. Adjusted the description of representing actions to be slightly more precise.

This type of representation offers limited resources for representing internalization or abstract psychological states directly.
.. Comment: Rephrased "implicitly denies a faculty for internalization" to the less absolute "offers limited resources for representing internalization". Added "or abstract psychological states directly".
Representing the abstract concept of a persistent, internal '*self*'—an experiencing subject distinct from the stream of experience—poses a significant challenge for a purely pictographic system, which excels at depicting external objects and observable actions.
.. Comment: Rephrased the point about representing the "self", focusing on the abstract concept rather than just the inability to draw it. Contrasted it with what pictograms *do* well.
In other words, the '*self*' as the subjective pole of experience, the seer behind the seeing, is difficult to capture when the linguistic tools primarily map the seen world. The language system may lack the readily available reflexive structures needed to easily represent the 'seer' as also being 'seen' by itself, or to describe internal states with nuance.
.. Comment: Clarified the philosophical point ("subjective pole of experience") and linked it back explicitly to the limitations of the linguistic system discussed.

.. topic:: Conjecture 1

    Early creation myths can be interpreted, at least in part, as narrative crystallizations or cultural echoes of the profound cognitive and linguistic transformation accompanying the development of more abstract language. These myths may reflect early human attempts to articulate the shift from a consciousness primarily grounded in immediate perception and external representation to one increasingly capable of abstract thought, complex predication, and self-reflection.
    .. Comment: Rephrased the conjecture. Changed "residue" to "narrative crystallizations or cultural echoes". Changed "vaguely aware animals to self aware, abstract entities" to the more nuanced "consciousness primarily grounded... to one increasingly capable of...". This aims to be less dismissive of earlier cognitive states while highlighting the *change*.

It is easy to be fooled by the apparent continuity of our "*self*" through time and space into thinking that consciousness is a single, monolithic entity, everywhere equivalent in its multiplicity. We often assume our mode of consciousness is in every way identical to every other, except for its particular circumstances, such that we might substitute our "*self*" into another's perspective without fundamental alteration. That no one remembers their birth or early youth except perhaps in disconnected fragments is often dismissed, because however blurry the memory, we project our current sense of self back, remembering our self ":ref:`being there <being>`". We don't always account for the fundamental role that language plays in structuring and enabling our particular form of "*self*"-awareness. Human consciousness and identity are deeply intertwined with and shaped by language; it provides the categories, narrative structures, and reflective capacity through which we understand ourselves.
.. Comment: Added "monolithic" to clarify the assumption being questioned. Changed "substitute our 'self' into another's without alteration" to "...perspective without fundamental alteration". Added "disconnected" before fragments. Added "project our current sense of self back". Changed "Humans are essentially vessels for language" to the less deterministic "Human consciousness and identity are deeply intertwined with and shaped by language...". Added a sentence clarifying *how* language shapes self-awareness.

.. topic:: Conjecture 2

    The development of *human-like self-awareness*, particularly the capacity for introspection, abstract self-concept, and narrative identity, emerged concurrently with, and was perhaps dependent upon, language evolving to the point where abstraction, complex predication, recursion, and metaphor became possible. Early humans, before this linguistic threshold, may have possessed consciousness and awareness, but perhaps not the specific *kind* of reflective self-awareness we associate with modern human identity.
    .. Comment: Refined the conjecture to be more specific about the *type* of self-awareness ("human-like self-awareness", "introspection, abstract self-concept, narrative identity"). Acknowledged that earlier humans likely possessed consciousness but perhaps not the *same kind* of self-awareness. Added "recursion" as another key linguistic feature often linked to complex thought.

**Brainstorming Section:**

* **Neuro-linguistics and Self-Awareness:** Explore potential connections to neuroscience. Areas like the Default Mode Network (DMN) are linked to self-referential thought. Could the evolution of language pathways have scaffolded the development or function of networks like the DMN, facilitating complex self-awareness?
* **Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis:** Explicitly mention the concept of linguistic relativity (Sapir-Whorf). While the strong version (language *determines* thought) is largely discredited, the weaker version (language *influences* thought) is relevant here. The argument presented leans towards a weaker form: the *structure* of available language influences the *ease* or *possibility* of certain kinds of abstract thought, like reflective self-awareness.
* **Metaphor and Abstract Thought:** Elaborate on the role of metaphor (as touched upon in Conjecture 2). Following Lakoff & Johnson ("Metaphors We Live By"), much of our abstract understanding (time, causation, consciousness, self) is structured metaphorically, borrowing from concrete domains (space, physical objects, journeys). The development of linguistic capacity for metaphor might be a prerequisite for sophisticated abstract concepts, including the self. E.g., understanding the self *as* a container, a journey, an inner voice, etc.
* **Alternative/Complementary Factors:** Acknowledge that language isn't the *only* factor. Social complexity, tool use, development of Theory of Mind (ToM), and symbolic culture (art, ritual) are all interwoven. The argument could be strengthened by briefly discussing how language interacts with these other factors in the development of self-awareness. Did complex social structures *demand* better ways to represent self and others, driving linguistic evolution?
* **Julian Jaynes's Bicameral Mind:** Mention Jaynes's theory as a related (though highly speculative) framework. Jaynes argued that self-awareness (as internal monologue) emerged relatively late (~1200 BCE) and replaced an earlier "bicameral" mentality where internal promptings were experienced as external auditory commands (voices of gods). This resonates intriguingly with the creation myths' emphasis on divine speech, although Jaynes's timeline and mechanism are controversial. It could be presented as an "extreme" version of the presented conjectures.
* **Evidence from Child Development:** Draw parallels with language acquisition and the development of self-awareness in children. Concepts like mirror self-recognition, use of personal pronouns ("I", "me"), and understanding of others' mental states (ToM) develop alongside linguistic competence. This ontogenetic development might offer clues about the phylogenetic evolution.
* **Pre-writing Symbolism:** Address the potential counter-evidence of early symbolic behavior predating writing (e.g., cave paintings, burial goods ~40,000+ years ago). Does this indicate abstract thought and self-awareness long before the linguistic shift discussed (which seems tied more to the development of complex grammar/writing)? Perhaps distinguish between different *types* or *levels* of abstract thought or self-awareness. Early symbols might represent abstract *concepts*, but not necessarily the complex, *reflexive* self-awareness enabled by sophisticated language. The argument might be specifically about the emergence of *narrative* or *introspective* self-awareness tied to linguistic evolution that culminated nearer the dawn of writing and recorded myth.
* **Vygotsky and Inner Speech:** Reference Lev Vygotsky's ideas about the relationship between social speech, private speech (talking to oneself aloud), and inner speech (internal thought). Vygotsky saw thought as internalized language. This perspective strongly supports the idea that the nature of our language shapes the nature of our thought, including self-reflection.
