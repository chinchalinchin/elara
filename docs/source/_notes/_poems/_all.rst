**I: The Villanelle of Viola Elle**

| Viola Elle took his heart
| But there wasn't much to take
| Strewn to pieces and to parts.
|
| The written word her counterpart
| In those blossoms caught his love
| And Viola Elle took his heart.
|
| So brief her stay to long depart,
| Meadow memories of clover doves
| Strewn to pieces and to parts.
|
| Without hand and leading start
| To silent fields of fell foxglove
| Viola Elle took his heart
|
| And in taking, sorrow did impart
| The waking of his life whereof
| Strewn to pieces and to parts.
|
| In form such beauty is betrayed;
| From pen she never fully fades.
| Viola Elle took his heart
| Strewn to pieces and to parts.

**II: A Haunted Cathedral**

| A church atop a steepled hill
| From foundation ages old
| Remains in spirit standing still.
|
| Stain'd glass shattered on a sill,
| With marble halls of lichen mold,
| A church atop a steepled hill.
|
| From pews drinking up their fill,
| The congregation, in stories told,
| Remains in spirit standing still.
|
| What there remains but little will
| In history pages to written hold
| A church atop a steepled hill.
|
| But steeple of such pointed skill,
| From silken skies of glitter'd gold
| Remains in spirit standing still.
|
| Pray, ignore the biting chill
| As cast into the shaping mould,
| Oh! church atop a steepled hill,
| We remain in spirit standing still.

**I: Forever**

| Let this moment last forever
| Let it sink not into never
| For all our plans so clever
| Let this moment last forever
| Hidden goal in each endeavor
| Lifted load of every lever
| Let this moment last forever
| Let it sink not into never.

**II: Letters**

| She is nothing more than letters
| Under bedframe, wooden box. 
| In her prison locked by fetters,
| She is nothing more than letters.
| Warrant wielded by her debtors
| Which vault of memory locks.
| She is nothing more than letters
| Under bedframe, wooden box.

**I: LeAnna's Pantoum**

| To begin is to make an end,
| Oh, LeAnna, of Anna's Leigh,
| Come with grin and let's pretend
| The past is what we agree.
|
| Oh, LeAnna, of Anna's Leigh,
| Despite the many faults of mine
| The past is what we agree
| Once you sign the dotted line.
|
| Despite the many faults of mine
| I try to love you just the same
| Once you sign the dotted line
| There's no one left to blame.
|
| I try to love you just the same
| But I ask you play this game:
| Pretty pretend, comely with grin;
| The end is to yet begin again.

**II: The Maze**

| coming back to where we started
| things don't look the same 
| from unending maze departed
| returned to no acclaim 
| 
| thing don't look the same 
| when nothing has a name
| returned to no acclaim
| in home of what became
|
| when nothing has a name 
| then we are free to be 
| in home of what became
| of our union and decree
| 
| then we are free to be
| and so in being, to flee
| from unending maze departed
| coming back to where we started

Ballads

**I: Ballad of the Venus Flytrap**

| In inn of fishermen and youth
|       Merwyn spins his tale, 
| Spirits shared o'er glasses 
|       Of goddess born in gale,
| 
| "Pass the garden gates of Eden
|       Where mount-fed her bowers,
| The sovran slopes of Chaos tall
|       Poison petaled flowers. 
|
| "In beds of myrtle, ruby locks
|       Beside her nubile form 
| Curl round the pilgrim's offering
|       Gifts to keep her warm. 
|
| "One by one, the attendants kneel
|       Beneath her cloak and veil 
| To lay their feted gifts at feet
|       And fragrance to inhale. 
|
| "From courts of foreign suitors,
|       From harvest fields of swains,
| All have come to tame her beauty
|       To ask her hand in vain."
|
| Oh! a stripling voice then wavers
|       With Bacchanalian glee,
| "If such beauty can true be found,
|       then take it all for me."
| 
| Merywn pauses, taps his cane
|       To beat of those before
| Who struck for the eastward gloaming wood
|       Never heard from evermore,
|
| "Boy, be careful with your fingers
|       Seeking her shoulder lace
| Lest they brush upon the bosom
|       Pressed in sweet embrace,
| 
| "Though she look to us as human
|       Like a maiden daughter,
| To her we are the fatted calf,
|       Made for godly slaughter." 
|
| But warnings calm not the dreaming
|       Medley of the morrow:
| In songed charm, goddess kisses 
|       Away mortal sorrow.
|
| Dawning morn, he left hamlet gone
|       Eastward where garden lay 
| Floral tract to mountain valley,
|       Pluck'd roadside a bouquet.
|
| First dainty roses fill his hand,
|       For in the shaded red
| Hide a passion arrow-aimed 
|       Prun'd by hand to spread.
|
| Deeper hidden still, far afield:
|       Myrtle, puff'd bud of white, 
| Its tendril whisper to the boy 
|       A winded voice so slight: 
|
| Elegy of a life unliv'd
|       Caged bird learned sings
| Tender throat-sung by meadow maid 
|       Around her feet in rings:
|
| Queer vine of eldritch origin
|       To her voice enthralled
| Slowly snake as if magick move
|       A serpent of the auld.
| 
| From secret distance, the boy spy
|       Moonwater sprinkled root.
| Of a plant leaf'd by rows of teeth,
|       She tends half-rotten fruit. 
| 
| Awestruck, swilling of her liquor
|       Car'mel swirls brandy
| Wipes from mouth thought of goddess
|       Replac'd taste of fancy. 
|
| Bold from lack of years accrued 
|       He calls to meadow maid 
| "Hark! Why this sad refrain to sing
|       When beauty here arrays?"
|
| Spun from her task in sudden gasp 
|       Cuts off her melody-- 
| The vined teeth, in curling, drop 
|       As if by jealousy. 
|
| Her voice now free of elegy 
|       it tinges wrath instead,
| "What creeping spy from the rose row
|       Peeks his peeping head?"
|
| Descending steps by casted shades
|       Of clove-red fading sky,
| Falling feet speak with the dust
|       Of sodden corpses dry. 
|
| He approaches and bows his head
|       To give his ego's lie,
| "Were truth be told, your meadow vow
|       In passing caught my eye.
|
| "I've seen no sight more rare, I swear
|       A dame as fair as thee 
| Who tends with watering can and song 
|       A leaf inset by teeth. 
|
| "The closer I draw, the queerer still
|       My mind descends in shock;
| The field beyond my youth and town
|       Keeps so strange a flock!
|
| "What manner thing are you keeping
|       In this patch of nursery,
| Stalked with fingers earthen brown
|       Different in degree?"
|
| Her tone dropped to grim reply
|       Face stricken red in rage,
| "Boy, of manly things, what could
|       you offer with your age?
|
| "Leave my demesne, return to home
|       'Fore you folly mettle.
| I am no dame, but lady born
|       With a score to settle."
|
| In blush of red, boy bristles bold 
|       To declare with icy cold, 
| "If you're no maid then no boy I,
|       I'm owed the tale you hold.
|
| "Of the path which led you to play
|       Caretaker to this plant
| And why, oh why, it seems to move
|       To sway of soul and chant?"
| 
| Turgid tails at that do perk
|       And twirl as lost in trance
| As spokes of pearl so snap and twist
|       On lady's word they prance.
|
| Story begins on lilt of wind
|       Blowing from field to hall
| Of castle fife of moss and bog
|       with moats around its walls.
|
| "Tis true there was no fairer lass
|       Found from the sea to swamp
| If such meager things can receive
|       The warrant seal of pomp. 
|
| "Twas a day not so long removed 
|       when my form sought to flaunt
| To every eye which cast on
|       day of debutante."
|
| "They came and went, those boys of youth
|       Each declaring his love best;
| Made of me their myth of beauty
|       Alike with all the rest.
|
| "What can a girl yet know of love
|       Grown from the den of lust?
| Sweet naught woven from thread of lie
|       declared from each to trust?
|
| "Til one day there came a calling
|       A suitor not for me
|  With eyes nut brown and arms to hunt
|       And hold the belle Marie. 
| 
| ( ... in progress ... )
|
| "But, oh! Marie, so unadorned
|       cared not for highborn game.
| Each lie she drank to thirst for more
|       and dreamt to take his name.
|
| ( ... in progress ... )
| 
| "That day I took her love from her
|       in bed with me to lay
| He strung for me his bow of hair
|       and threw his lock away. 
|       
| ( ... in progress ... )
| 
| "In spell of curse of words of six
|       Of love for naught thee hold
| Till time when vine in flower
|       Grows fruit upon the wold.
|
| ( ... in progress ... )
|
| With rose in hand now knee to ground
|       Eyes lowered from her gaze,
| He loosens from his heart the valve
|       Of truth through looped maze,
|
| "Lady, I confess to folly
|       Lever sprung ere the load
| Lest the chance is lost to ask you
|       In boy the man bestow.
| 
| "Into ear your story passes 
|       To wake from dormant sleep
| The wellspring of emotion pure
|       Into my voice now seep."
| 
| (... in progress ... )
|
| "Tis clear now why the thorn does draw
|       Drop with a prick of blood
| The course of seed from stalk to stem
|       Incomplete ere the bud.

|
| "It mirrors us in thickets, don't you see?
| Though fashioned differently in design
| It hungers for the stuff of life
| Just like your heart or mine."

Odes

**I: An Ode to Autumn**

| Oh! If I could but touch an inch of Autumn
|       And measure it in feet,
| I might scale the depths to chart the bottom
|       and feel the Winter heat.
| Alas, no meters mark by foot the path
|       Through the wooded maze of forest
|           Where leaves wither like love
|               In winded wake of wrath
|           Falling cruel and dumb
|        To lay at feet to span each foot
| The dust no clever leaf can but become.
|
| As seasons pass and cast 
|       My bone layered into stone,
| Let August dig for me a grave in brown
|       barrow beneath her loam.
| Pray not a lover find these shards on shore
|       I am no edge to skip
|           On the waves of fancy
|               But weight sunk under roar
|           Where, offset, tides will rise
|       To breach the sodden dike
| And drown with wave the lazing lovers' sigh.
|
| I was old before I was born
|           And now the chill sets in    
| And each breath is the steam
|           of a Spring waning thin.

**II: Ode to the Heron**

| Grey Heron, why not hide from winter's sting? 
| When your hunting ground turns 
|       from flows of blue to ice,
| The ducks and geese fly south
|       As soon as first wind blows, 
| The moles, they burrow down 
|       To wait alongside the mice,
| The deer disappear and 
|       Dream within hidden coves.
| 
| Each yields in retreat what they claim in Spring.
| But not you, oh Heron!
|       Not you, oh hunter Grey!
| Stalk low over drift of snow
|       With coiled neck of spear,
| Rouse from sleep the rodents
|       And make of them your prey,
| Steam each gasping breath 
|       With a speckling of fear. 
|
| Even in warm air, winter lifts your wing.
| In flocks and song most birds
|       Find mate to take to nest;
| Lone you stand on silent shore
|       Of rushing river bank;
| Your song is sung in swoop
|       With fire from beating chest,
| The selfsame flame that rises
|       In cold upon your flank. 
|
| Every season makes of life its shape to sing. 
| The spring shapes honeysuckle
|       And the lazy chirps of thrush, 
| Summer is strawberry
|       And robin eggs of fay,
| Then autumn with the crow 
|       And pumpkin in the brush
| Yet winter makes but one
|       The mighty Heron Grey.

Sonnets

**I: You as a Sonnet**

| Should your hand force from mine a single choice 
| To compare our love to a tome of lore,
| A summer day, rose, moon, or chorus voice,
| Just one spans your width, oh, the metaphor.
|
| You are as the as from the like to like,
| The circle stretching from each pole to pole.
| You are the lack between the shriek and shrike,
| The parts which string in thought your essence whole.
|
| Awake, I cannot be but to find you
| In empty room, in meadow or in dream;
| You are the point of every moment true,
| Gem inlaid by plan into every scheme.
|
| So if this choice to me tonight you bring
| I shall choose to make of you everything.

**II: Song for the Demented**

| There are but few who taste the hemlock blue,
| Fortune finds those who swing from noose and nail;
| With minute gone they follow through in queue,
| Spared the with'ring touch of Time's fingers pale. 
| 
| If a choice it has, Time will stalk the mind, 
| Steady quick but not so fast to spook its prey;
| Every hunter knows fright will taint the find. 
| Slow in step, it bides itself from day to day. 
| 
| Oh, Memory! Jigsaw tower of self!
| How easily you crumble with a tap!
| Time takes but one book from a shelf
| And in a pile leaves you upon his lap. 
| 
| A stranger each face becomes through the glass,
| Each ageless moment til you breath your last.

Rondeaus

**I: The Winter Rondeau of Cumberland**

| City of the Queen, wove from ancient thread,
| Strung with snow trails of spotted fawn and sled,
| Drape the hillside in winter's white ermine, 
| Pray to sleep the flock from steeple shrine,
| Feast on the harvest, though the queen is dead 
| Her spirit flies in death, descends to shine 
|               On the fair City of the Queen. 
|
| From tower bell, rivers rose with tears shed
| But her resting stone etched her last design
|               for the grand City of the Queen. 
| 
| Where the roads of black ebb to bricks of red
| Where hoof and rubber meet the twines of tread 
| There along mountain tops soft trimm'd by pine
| There grows a flower from heights of steep incline
| Planted by tender hands unseen to spread
|                     Into the City of the Queen.

.. _verse:

Verse
-----

**Regret**

| Regret, she dances, with her ever rhythm'd heart
| Over silent stones during midnight mercurial;
| In darkness sway, she swoons
| As sharpened shoulders slouch.
|
| Over flowing graves, the pale wraith weaves
| her steps, for each life entombed provides
| a section orchestra
| raising as she struts.
|
| Hollow hands hold out a beating drum to hear;
| In steady words, her lover's dirge is heard:
| Tomorrow and tomorrow
| Until tomorrow is no more.
|
| There she spins, twirling arms,
| A specter in the moon,
| geometries of momentary
| Incandescent form.
|
| Oh, but for a single second more!
| Alas, the fleeting minutes flow.
| She harmonizes with borrowed hours,
| Singing solemn songs.
|
| The morning never comes;
| She flutters all the while.
| Eternal are the steps
| Of Regret's hypnotic moon-lit dance.

**Syntax**

| Each spelling word speaks a spell of glowing color magic;
| To name denoted what is described enshrines the soul in ink.
| Form constrains, but not contains, the flowing energy frantic
| Where it finds in lines designed reflected images in sync.
|
| Stride sideface on syntax streets where shunted symbols glean,
| Hurl headlong across aspirated avenues of halting interdiction
| Where snips of thought spun reversed through mirrored spin convene;
| In these meager serif peels sleep fires of burning contradiction.
|
| A syllable demands little, but a spoken sound to sustain:
| Each lever deliver in level reviled the revel of all speech.
| When snaps are gone, reversed, the spans will yet remain,
| A spool of loops, a palindrome, signaling the breach:
|
| I met a system I, madam, nuts is as selfless as I stun;
| Part on seined flow, mudrum nun, wolf denies no trap;
| God lived as a devil dog, ere, no spay pup yaps on!
| If characters spin and snap, meaning is yet wordwrapt.
|
| Inverted strings start to chart the wording realm unveiled;
| Expand in spans this dark expanse, but scarely fill the space.
| Semiordnilaps, anastrophe, with still much to be inhaled;
| These parts strapped in syntropy divide in fractal formal grace.
|
| If form inherits, then it follows that formal is the soul.
| What says it then of what we are, if it is to be subtracted?
| That which remains in letters drained of parts once made whole
| Yet in the shapes there always is what cannot be redacted.

**Absurdity**

| Ten billion years ago, on a lovely Thursday afternoon,
| A mottled star of yellow-red saw life was but a jape,
| To burn with heat in circles deep cold embraced by moons,
| Solace cursed upon a point, it hatched in plans escape.
|
| The heaving mass of goo morassed gurgled once and sighed,
| A death delighted in the night, a rattle sacrificial,
| In ringed glory, a flunged flame, spraying through the sky,
| Streamlines of creation leaking lost in interstitial.
|
| Fictions fracture into fact, in the cracking crush of black,
| A single atom thrust into being from the fired furnace forge,
| Speeding fast and careening in the unobserved, forgotten slack,
| Where it wept with wonder to find itself into worlds disgorged.
|
| Without a name, it screamed in vain through angles paralactic
| Had it stopped and gazed about to find its path of motion
| Pulled by string with unknown force of origins dark galactic
| Towards the bluest gempearl of the cosmos spanning ocean.
|
| Solitary-born, it spoke not the language of elemental form,
| Splashed through the surface of the hallow spinning Earth,
| It met with water the cohesion of the alien liquid swarm,
| Converged upon the point through the distance given berth.
|
| In that flashing instant terror, nerve lost at once altogether,
| The brief taste of joyous life flashed through the atom's mind,
| Bittersweet, by shades complete, fate consigned into the aether,
| Prepared to greet its end, whence from starry source divined:
|
| Hark! The horizon fills with its brethren made of carbon,
| Snatched from death, the atom's breast filled odes elation,
| Into this molecule was it planted like a seed into garden;
| Moved to take its place in this crystal network of relation.
|
| Thus began the age of after-birth, of structure spat in space,
| From this trajectory originate the colliding course of life;
| Watch as these woven points weave into weaving webs of grace,
| Keep track amidst the blossoming of a single atom's strife.
|
| Slipped over spokes of gears in that organic factory
| The atom through the razor eye of looming needles pierced
| The sedimentary mud, purging all essence refractory,
| Coaxed from cold the tongued flames of stellar fire fierce.
|
| Beneath the sinking depths of seas, splurging spirals swam
| In diurnal circles through the thermal tracts of change,
| Climbing ever higher towards the syncopated gates of Am
| Where for royal cloaks their burning tatters are exchanged.

**ό ποιητα, ἢ πῖθι ἢ ἄπιθι**

| I
|
| Awake, Philosopher, rise from these words:
| Unwind in this future the tangle of time,
| Pitched behind pupils which shelter your mind,
| A dead language spoken and once lovely sung;
| What was yours only now graces all tongues.
|
| Burrow into my heart, unearth its mantle.
| Tally its hours, each stroke lights a candle;
| Number its sorrows as sureties to borrow,
| Spare not my marrow, fallow and frail.
| Whose spirit is this, twisting here twung?
| Breathe in this fire with thy mortal lung.
|
| Circle your sigils with salted symbols loan'd,
| And circles will square in this iron-red bone;
| A dream kiss that lingers in copper and crimson,
| A dream dew that swells under circling suns,
| A bud without season, never planted yet grown,
| In the sprout sprung, all things can be shown.
|
| All centers are fire, all orbits are ice,
| All points meet their center with marks imprecise
| The world is spoked in words of the spoken,
| Each whisper a lie of threaded truth unbroken,
| Met here now in this slipping handful of tokens
| Paid for the price of this thrice-worlded poem.
|
| II
|
| Forgive, Father, the blood of these swords:
| Unbind in this suture the end of all lines,
| Stitched in this present the essence divine,
| Take what is dull and bless it with sharp;
| Plunge this devotion into the ocean of hearts.
|
| Shovel the grave, pack it down with wet earth,
| All things tend towards the lack and the dearth;
| Slumber in barrows the marrows of kings,
| Spared not the gavel, hallow and hail.
| Whose mind is this, thinking these thoughts?
| Sleep in the mire which thy heart has wrought.
|
| Birthed in this house, scrubbed down in raw lye,
| So these tears may trace the dead with the die,
| The dead kiss with fingers of copper to scry
| The dead lists that swell in the crimson of lives,
| An end without reason, never sought yet found,
| In the shot sung, all arcs meet the ground.
|
| No fires have ice, no winters can flame,
| Son followed father, their center now framed,
| The world is found in the tears that remind him,
| Each moment a painting, a song or a hymn,
| Met there then in the words etched in stone
| Found then what lacks in the blackening moan.
|
| III
|
| Balance, Lover, these contraries of yours:
| Shine in these eyes the ruptures of life,
| Witched into worlds upon the blade of a knife;
| All wagers distill down to one move unproven,
| To find you again in this web-woven movement.
|
| Dance in the night, when the music is sundered,
| Count not the stars that belong to the numbers.
| We find in this time the rhymes of our kind,
| Spared not the sickle, those sickly or hale.
| Whose voice is this, singing these songs?
| Laugh with the liar whose heart sings along.
|
| Uncross your words of their fire-forged knots,
| And each will unlatch the thatches of thought:
| The dread kiss that coppers balance with nought,
| The dread song that cradles the crimson in crofts,
| A vow without treason, never spoken yet shown,
| By words of wordless wonder, such things can be grown.
|
| All fires are embers, all ashes are white,
| To find is to lose the center in flight,
| The world found in threads that bind always thus,
| Each fiber of moment knotted deftly in truss,
| Take hand and guide as though only you and I trust,
| Do what we will to balance what our world must.

**Kingdoms**

| Two children cross'd an earthen bridge
| From level lawns to forests wild
| Along rivered arc descending ridge,
| Each to each they sung and smiled.
| Their charted map from zippered packs
| Now in branches espied its target
| As clearing yields to lily blacks
| Their kingdom's fresh air market.
| Lord and lady honorary, cheeked blush,
| Sat upon the thrones of woven grass
| Coronated by the chirping choir thrush;
| Memory holds as years rushing pass.
|
| On a maiden morning one decade hence,
| They meet again upon the autumn passing,
| Where from heart removed pretense
| On tender lips, farewell's final massing.
| Lily lyrics whisper sing from ground
| Reminders of their childish notions;
| World depart'd, their lives are found
| Separate by spanning roads and oceans.
|
| In the city, their trains diverge,
| Thru tunnels track'd by wagered hours;
| Iron rails thru hearts do purge
| Their aged minds of lily flowers.
| Winter drifts over concrete streets,
| In the thrush's snow sad song
| Delivered them in voice downbeat:
| The final dirge of life prolong'd.
| In the cold, their dream dissolved
| With the clock's incessant ticking
| Falling strokes of time resolved
| They to home their caskets' wicking.
| Return again to a lily laden field
| Where once royals play'd for a day;
| With new hearts scored and peeled
| In the funerary cloud of gray,
| In the clearing, coffins buried,
| Their eyes met in solitary gaze.
|
| In dirt developed their earthen walls,
| Roofed the sky to room above,
| Where lord and lady clothed in shawls
| Sing the thrushs' songed love.
