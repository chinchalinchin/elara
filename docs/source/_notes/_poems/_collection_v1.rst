I: Elemental Elegy
------------------

| The day I sat by death's grey bed,
| I told a story both green and true
| Of city bricks stacked proud and red,
| Of silver paths the stars imbue
| With golden hue we might have tread.
| Your breath though blew there cold and blue.
|
| I spoke the words to yellow skin
| And told of days in white to come.
| Your mouth, with specks of purple grin,
| And fingers stretched so pale and numb,
| My name, you said, so clear, so thin--
| With final grasp, in black succumb.
| 
| Oh--Father, Father--brass horns blare!
| You string your harp with diamond thread
| And leave in me this slate despair!
| What crystal tears in eyes now shed?
| What pearl is formed by sightless stare?
| What platinum found in prayers pled? 
|
| The oak around your body wraps
| As shoots of pine through spine are grown.
| In loam the roots will bind your scraps
| Despite the flowers laid on stone.
| Each time I come a stem I snap, 
| For only Earth deserves your bone.

Lyrics

I: Wine
-------

| What flows is not what flows
|     But wine from sight concealed,
| Present spilling o'er lips
|     From barrel cork unsealed. 
| Agony! Of moment's time
|    To pour from heart to lung,
| Distilled to simple words
|    In verse's twisted tongue. 
| Of vine and light that grew
|    the fruit of form to fill,
| There lingers aftertaste
|    but lacks a certain frill.
| In drip of character 
|    glasses tipped to brim,
| Imbibed from ear to ear 
|    where thoughts attempt to swim,
| The meaning drowns in drink
|    Of hint of sought intent,
| But flavor cannot capture
|    What truly palette meant.

II: Sunday Ghosts
-----------------

| On Sunday morning drive to your
|   Mountain cemetery,
| From black of road there rose the mists
|   To west where winds carry
| The ghosts the ground have failed to keep
|   Where earth lay bare through tar,
| Where oaks and willows reach to weep
|   But watch aghast afar,
| Decades through pores now poured in droves
|   As over them I drove,
| Their grasping tongues of fog unfurled,
|   With craft a road they wove,
| Until no longer did I drive but flee
|   From lane of memory.

III: On The Origin of Wind
--------------------------

| The shape of wind in blades of grass,
|     Invisible heartbeat,
| I watch your dance from windowed room
|    In rising summer heat,
| Your pressured pulse that skips through sky
|     With history unseen,
| I wonder where this prologue starts,
|     what ancient chorus scene
| Announced your birth on fertile Earth
|    and blew the trumpet loud;
| Who called to you from great beyond
|    to tend this court of cloud?
| What sight will see your silent state
|    which spans expanse in dark?
| What ears will hear your solid plea
|    which leaves in naught its mark?
| What moment did you rise to life? 
|    What second do we praise?
| Your source, like form, is hidden close
|    In foggy, timeless haze. 
| In tracing back your tangled threads
|     they twine around and spool;
| Each point begins with points before
|     Always as if by rule. 

IV: The World That Spins
------------------------

| The world that spins about its point,
|     That spun from loom these days,
| The one from sun that does anoint
|     As thread from time decays.
| I plucked a flower morning come
|     To save its life from woe.
| It wilted under press of thumb
|     In dying afterglow.
| Its soul through sweetly scented air
|     In secret met the gloam.
| Such poor design, so frail this share
|     That beauty makes a home.
| That afternoon we met at last
|     Though I with empty hand.
| There time removed from us amassed
|     The knots it wove through strands.
| Like vapor mist to sky dissolved
|     I wept at our good-bye,
| To see your eyes from dreams resolved
|     With nothing to reply.

I: An Ode To Autumn
-------------------

| Oh! If I could touch an inch of Autumn
|       And measure Fall in feet,
| I might scale its depths to chart the bottom
|       and feel the Winter heat.
| Alas, no meters mark by foot the path
|       Through wooded maze of trees
|           Where leaves like love will wilt
|               In winded wake of wrath
|           In gusts blown cruel and dumb
|        To lay at feet to span each foot
| The dust each clever leaf here does become.
|
| As seasons pass and cast 
|       My bone layered into stone,
| Let August dig for me a grave in brown
|       barrow beneath her loam.
| Pray not a lover find these shards on shore
|       I am no edge to skip
|           Atop the waves of fancy
|               But under weight sunk roar
|           Where, offset, tides will rise
|       To breach the sodden dike
| And drown with wave the lazing lovers' sigh.
|
| To life I came already old and grim
|           But now the chill sets in;    
| Each breath in gasp dispels to steam
|           of Spring now waning thin.

II: Ode to the Heron
--------------------

| Grey Heron, why not hide from winter's sting? 
| When hunting ground then turns 
|       from flows of blue to ice,
| The geese and ducks go south
|       As wind begins to blow, 
| Next the moles burrow down 
|       To wait beside the mice,
| The deer though disappear,
|       their dreams in hidden coves.
| 
| All retreat and yield what they claim in Spring.
| Oh! Heron! All but one!
|       Not you, oh hunter Grey!
| Stalk low on drift of snow
|       With coiled neck of spear,
| To rouse the sleeping rats
|       And feast upon your prey,
| To steam their gasping breath 
|       With scream of speckled fear. 
|
| As seasons switch yet winter lifts your wing.
| In flocks and song most birds
|       Find mate to take to nest;
| Lone you stand, silent shore
|       Of rushing river bank;
| Your song is sung in swoop
|       With fire from beating chest,
| The selfsame flame that rises
|       In cold upon your flank. 
|
| Each season makes of life its shape to sing. 
| Spring shapes azalea buds
|       And lazy chirping thrush, 
| In summer sweats, berry red
|       And robin eggs of fay,
| Autumn with crows of black
|       In pumpkin laden brush,
| Yet winter makes but one
|       The mighty Heron Grey.

Poems
=====

Regret
------

| Regret, she dances, with her ever rhythm'd heart
| Over silent stones during midnight mercurial;
| In darkness sway, she swoons
| As sharpened shoulders slouch.
|
| Over flowing graves, the pale wraith weaves
| her steps, for each life entombed provides
| a section orchestra
| raising as she struts. 
|
| Hollow hands hold out a beating drum to hear;
| In steady words, her lover's dirge is heard: 
| Tomorrow and tomorrow
| Until tomorrow is no more.
|
| There she spins, twirling arms,
| A specter in the moon,
| geometries of momentary
| Incandescent form.
|
| Oh, but for a single second more!
| Alas, the fleeting minutes flow. 
| She harmonizes with borrowed hours,
| Singing solemn songs.  
|
| The morning never comes;
| She flutters all the while.
| Eternal are the steps
| Of Regret's hypnotic moon-lit dance.

Syntax
------

| Each spelling word speaks a spell of glowing color magic;
| To name denoted what is described enshrines the soul in ink.  
| Form constrains, but not contains, the flowing energy frantic
| Where it finds in lines designed reflected images in sync. 
| 
| Stride sideface on syntax streets where shunted symbols glean,
| Hurl headlong across aspirated avenues of halting interdiction
| Where snips of thought spun reversed through mirrored spin convene;
| In these meager serif peels sleep fires of burning contradiction.
| 
| A syllable demands little, but a spoken sound to sustain:
| Each lever deliver in level reviled the revel of all speech. 
| When snaps are gone, reversed, the spans will yet remain,
| A spool of loops, a palindrome, signaling the breach:
|
| I met a system I, madam, nuts is as selfless as I stun;
| Part on seined flow, mudrum nun, wolf denies no trap;
| God lived as a devil dog, ere, no spay pup yaps on!
| If characters spin and snap, meaning is yet wordwrapt.
|
| Inverted strings start to chart the wording realm unveiled;  
| Expand in spans this dark expanse, but scarely fill the space.
| Semiordnilaps, anastrophe, with still much to be inhaled;
| These parts strapped in syntropy divide in fractal formal grace. 
|
| If form inherits, then it follows that formal is the soul.
| What says it then of what we are, if it is to be subtracted?
| That which remains in letters drained of parts once made whole
| Yet in the shapes there always is what cannot be redacted.

Absurdity
---------

| Ten billion years ago, on a lovely Thursday afternoon,
| A mottled star of yellow-red saw life was but a jape,
| To burn with heat in circles deep cold embraced by moons,
| Solace cursed upon a point, it hatched in plans escape.
|
| The heaving mass of goo morassed gurgled once and sighed,
| A death delighted in the night, a rattle sacrificial,
| In ringed glory, a flunged flame, spraying through the sky,
| Streamlines of creation leaking lost in interstitial.
| 
| Fictions fracture into fact, in the cracking crush of black,
| A single atom thrust into being from the fired furnace forge,
| Speeding fast and careening in the unobserved, forgotten slack,
| Where it wept with wonder to find itself into worlds disgorged.
|
| Without a name, it screamed in vain through angles paralactic
| Had it stopped and gazed about to find its path of motion
| Pulled by string with unknown force of origins dark galactic
| Towards the bluest gempearl of the cosmos spanning ocean.
|
| Solitary-born, it spoke not the language of elemental form,
| Splashed through the surface of the hallow spinning Earth,
| It met with water the cohesion of the alien liquid swarm,
| Converged upon the point through the distance given berth.
|
| In that flashing instant terror, nerve lost at once altogether,
| The brief taste of joyous life flashed through the atom's mind,
| Bittersweet, by shades complete, fate consigned into the aether,
| Prepared to greet its end, whence from starry source divined:
| 
| Hark! The horizon fills with its brethren made of carbon,
| Snatched from death, the atom's breast filled odes elation,
| Into this molecule was it planted like a seed into garden;
| Moved to take its place in this crystal network of relation.
|
| Thus began the age of after-birth, of structure spat in space, 
| From this trajectory originate the colliding course of life;
| Watch as these woven points weave into weaving webs of grace,
| Keep track amidst the blossoming of a single atom's strife.
|
| Slipped over spokes of gears in that organic factory 
| The atom through the razor eye of looming needles pierced
| The sedimentary mud, purging all essential refractory,
| Coaxed from cold the tongued flames of stellar fire fierce.
|
| Beneath the sinking depths of seas, splurging spirals swam
| In diurnal circles through the thermal tracts of change,
| Climbing ever higher towards the syncopated gates of Am 
| Where for royal cloaks their burning tatters are exchanged.  

ό ποιητα, ἢ πῖθι ἢ ἄπιθι
------------------------

| I
| 
| Awake, Philosopher, rise from these words:
| Unwind in this future the tangle of time,
| Pitched behind pupils which shelter your mind,
| A dead language spoken and once lovely sung;
| What was yours only now graces all tongues. 
| 
| Burrow into my heart, unearth its mantle. 
| Tally its hours, each stroke lights a candle;
| Number its sorrows as sureties to borrow,
| Spare not my marrow, fallow and frail.
| Whose spirit is this, twisting here twung? 
| Breathe in this fire with thy mortal lung.
| 
| Circle your sigils with salted symbols loan'd,
| And circles will square in this iron-red bone;
| A dream kiss that lingers in copper and crimson,
| A dream dew that swells under circling suns,
| A bud without season, never planted yet grown,
| In the sprout sprung, all things can be shown.
|
| All centers are fire, all orbits are ice,
| All points meet their center with marks imprecise
| The world is spoked in words of the spoken,
| Each whisper a lie of threaded truth unbroken,
| Met here now in this slipping handful of tokens
| Paid for the price of this thrice-worlded poem. 
|
| II
| 
| Forgive, Father, the blood of these swords:
| Unbind in this suture the end of all lines, 
| Stitched in this present the essence divine,
| Take what is dull and bless it with sharp;
| Plunge this devotion into the ocean of hearts.
| 
| Shovel the grave, pack it down with wet earth,
| All things tend towards the lack and the dearth;
| Slumber in barrows the marrows of kings,
| Spared not the gavel, hallow and hail.
| Whose mind is this, thinking these thoughts?
| Sleep in the mire which thy heart has wrought. 
| 
| Birthed in this house, scrubbed down in raw lye,
| So these tears may trace the dead with the die,
| The dead kiss with fingers of copper to scry
| The dead lists that swell in the crimson of lives,
| An end without reason, never sought yet found,
| In the shot sung, all arcs meet the ground.
| 
| No fires have ice, no winters can flame,
| Son followed father, their center now framed,
| The world is found in the tears that remind him,
| Each moment a painting, a song or a hymn,
| Met there then in the words etched in stone
| Found then what lacks in the blackening moan.
| 
| III
| 
| Balance, Lover, these contraries of yours:
| Shine in these eyes the ruptures of life,
| Witched into worlds upon the blade of a knife;
| All wagers distill down to one move unproven,
| To find you again in this web-woven movement. 
|
| Dance in the night, when the music is sundered,
| Count not the stars that belong to the numbers.
| We find in this time the rhymes of our kind,
| Spared not the sickle, those sickly or hale.
| Whose voice is this, singing these songs?
| Laugh with the liar whose heart sings along.
| 
| Uncross your words of their fire-forged knots,
| And each will unlatch the thatches of thought:
| The dread kiss that coppers balance with nought,
| The dread song that cradles the crimson in crofts,
| A vow without treason, never spoken yet shown, 
| By words of wordless wonder, such things can be grown.
|
| All fires are embers, all ashes are white,
| To find is to lose the center in flight,
| The world found in threads that bind always thus,
| Each fiber of moment knotted deftly in truss,
| Take hand and guide as though only you and I trust,
| Do what we will to balance world's thrust.

The Paronymous Polpytotons of Love 
----------------------------------

| "πτερωτὸν τῷ πτερῷ πτερωτὸν ῥηθήσεται."
|    - Categories, 7.15, Aristotle
|
| I am an am that was an is,
|   the life those lives through living live.
| The songs that sing what singers sung 
|   With strings when stringed lutes were strung,
| Where cloven clefts with leaves of clove
|   The weft of weave with warp so wove,
| On evening eve, the eave of eyes,
|   where rows of rose began to rise,
| There seeing seized to see the sight
|   that lit up lightened like a light:
| She shined in sheen and shining shone
|   In binding bound beneath my bone.
| In fleeing flight we flew in flood
|   as blooded bleeding bled their blood,
| The deaths the dying died before 
|   were laid to lie by lying score. 
| I is an am that is a were
|  That whirled a world to whirl with her.

I: LeAnna's Pantoum
-------------------

| To begin is to make an end,
| Oh, LeAnna, of Anna's Leigh,
| Come with grin and play pretend
| The past is what we both agree.
|
| Oh, LeAnna, of Anna's Leigh,
| Despite the many faults of mine,
| The past is what we both agree
| Once marks are made on dotted line.
|
| Despite the many faults of mine,
| I'll try to love you just the same;
| Once marks are made on dotted line
| There's no one left but you to blame.
|
| I'll try to love you just the same
| But I implore you play this game:
| Pretty pretend, comely with grin;
| The end will yet begin again.

I: Rondeau for the River Rats
------------------------------

| On river shore the poor in tents are stored
|    To keep from sight their score.
| Above and north, the city steeples meet 
| To speak in sermons ever indiscrete
|     for sheep they so ignore.
| 
| They fight with roar, yet beaten, kiss through gore;
| From barrel fired dream, north they look for more,
| The city lights too far a source of heat
|    For life on river shore. 
|
| In winter months they paint on skin a whore,
| And every one despite what silence swore.
|     In life they all must cheat,
|     Become their own deceit,
| To win a war for land they all abhor:
|     Their home on river shore.

I: A Sonnet for Cumberland MD
-------------------------------

| Bay silt in city stone through time accrues
| to-wards the western course of concrete flow
| that sweeps from plain to sky in upward spews
| as grey-white spray arcs over wave to snow
| from heights on high to splash on mountain spine
| where valleyed pools so rise to drink their fill
| and shoot with sprouts through shoulders made of pine
| the roofs that empty crowds on streets and spill
| through hand to hand the layers stack'd from base
| to brick by brick til building lillies bred
| against the westward wall in flood's embrace
| where lips at last are wet in watershed;
|
| Let skyline mark where tide in climb was broke:
| Steeple, roof, needles pine and leaves of oak.

| Let this moment last forever
| Let it sink not into never
| For all our plans so clever

| Hidden goal in each endeavor
| Lifted load of every lever
| Let this moment last forever
| Let it sink not into never.

II: Letters
-----------

| She is nothing more than letters
| Under bedframe, wooden box. 
| In her prison locked by fetters,
| She is nothing more than letters.
| Warrant wielded by her debtors
| Which vault of memory locks.
| She is nothing more than letters
| Under bedframe, wooden box.

I: Plots
--------

| In time their plot was touched by dark.
| Began the page this meadow scene
| where blades of grass were tall and stark.
| 
| A tired arc, they met in park
| To kiss beneath the twilight queen;
| In time their plot was touched by dark.
| 
| They stole away on sudden lark,
| Exchanged the words from whispered lean
| Where blades of grass were tall and streek.
| 
| So happy and green, neighbors remark,
| Yet seem is such to lose its sheen,
| In time their plot was touched by dark. 
| 
| Yet faded years ignored their spark
| In death they died forever seen
| Where blades of grass were tall and stark.
| 
| In ground, their bodies disembark
| And leave behind a hole through clean.
| In time their plot was touched by dark,
| Where blades of grass were tall and stark.
