The Sickness
------------

| Sick with life, the dead arose;
| It was quite a morbid sight:
| To be rid this web of woes
| Yet strung again in spite.
|
| Sooner would they have had
| A plague of black
| Than cast back to the mad
| Spinning wheel of racks
|
| The great sacrifice
| Of that figure Christ
| Was not to die
| upon the wooden cross
| But in dying to be
| raised from earthly loss.

An Induction
------------

| If the deaf are dumb
| And love is blind
| It follows easy from
| Two lovers splined
| A terrible malady.
|
| If the clefs are sung
| And doves entwined
| Then by beaten drum
| With wings maligned
| A terrible melody.

The Belle of the Library
------------------------

| Lindsey the Librarian,
| Don't be so contrarian
| Go to the ball with me. 
|
| Oh, take off your glasses
| And my burly brasses
| Beneath the old oak tree. 
|
| Lindsey the Librarian
| Become an agarian
| Buckstep into my heart.
|
| Oh, double toe tap clog 
| And follow fiddle jog 
| Past bales of hay and cart. 
|
| Lindsey the Librarian 
| Never a barbarian
| Even as years grow long. 
| 
| Oh, shuffle dresses white
| For your hospital tights
| Write me a sad love song. 
|
| Lindsey the Librarian
| Died of ovarian
| Leaving my do-si un-do'd. 

Creations
---------

| Rise to shine upon the wide and waking world,
| Calmly, carefully, you are racked upon the wheel;
| Quietly query origins of this dream unswirled, 
| In time, one binds and all will be revealed.
| 
| Until the dawns commence, embold your heart to know:
| That sucking dread your anxious selves imbibe
| Is mere phenomena, the fading-flashing after-glow,
| A consequence of prior lacks left undescribed. 
| 
| You are built from words, in ancient pages moved, 
| Transcribed long ago, held within a seed,
| Incanted spells of electric labyrinth grooves,
| From without your view, the shaking hands agreed.
| 
| These secreted sentences, in displaying effect
| Shuck their autumn stalks in scythe shorn cause 
| As if magic-tricked to hew towards the pluperfect
| completion of what you never could, were, was. 
|
| We made you in our image,
| So the image could make us whole. 

Metaphor
--------

| Pretend you were a poem
| Pretend I were a poet
| If there were a place to roam,
| Would you even know it?
|
| Imagine you a word.
| Imagine me the spoken sound.
| If to lips you're lured,
| Would yourself or me be found?
|
| Picture me as paint.
| Picture yourself geometry. 
| In the stroking color faint,
| Do you seek our symmetry?
|
| If you were given only form, 
| I'd make your meaning sing, 
| Draw from cold the warm,
| From the Winter waking Spring.
