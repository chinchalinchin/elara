The Sickness
------------

| Sick with life, the dead arose;
| It was quite a morbid sight:
| To be rid this web of woes
| Yet strung again in spite.
|
| Sooner would they have had
| A plague of black
| Than cast back to the mad
| Spinning wheel of racks
|
| The great sacrifice
| Of that figure Christ
| Was not to die
| upon the wooden cross
| But in dying to be
| raised from earthly loss.

An Induction
------------

| If the deaf are dumb
| And love is blind
| It follows easy from
| Two lovers splined
| A terrible malady.
|
| If the clefs are sung
| And doves entwined
| Then by beaten drum
| With wings maligned
| A terrible melody.
