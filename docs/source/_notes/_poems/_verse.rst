| Oh! If I could touch an inch of Autumn
|       And measure Fall in feet,
| I might scale its depths to chart the bottom
|       and feel the Winter heat.
| Alas, no meters mark by foot the path
|       Through wooded maze of trees
|           Where leaves like love will wilt
|               In winded wake of wrath
|           In gusts blown cruel and dumb
|        To lay at feet to span each foot
| The dust each clever leaf here does become.
|
| As seasons pass and cast 
|       My bone layered into stone,
| Let August dig for me a grave in brown
|       barrow beneath her loam.
| Pray not a lover find these shards on shore
|       I am no edge to skip
|           Atop the waves of fancy
|               But under weight sunk roar
|           Where, offset, tides will rise
|       To breach the sodden dike
| And drown with wave the lazing lovers' sigh.
|
| To life I came already old and grim
|           But now the chill sets in;    
| Each breath in gasp dispels to steam
|           of Spring now waning thin.

| What flows is not what flows
|     But wine from sight concealed,
| Present spilling o'er lips
|     From barrel cork unsealed. 
| Agony! Of moment's time
|    To pour from heart to lung,
| Distilled to simple words
|    In verse's twisted tongue. 
| Of vine and light that grew
|    the fruit of form to fill,
| There lingers aftertaste
|    but lacks a certain frill.
| In drip of character 
|    glasses tipped to brim,
| Imbibed from ear to ear 
|    where thoughts attempt to swim,
| The meaning drowns in drink
|    Of hint of sought intent,
| But flavor cannot capture
|    What truly palette meant.

| Mimic, dear mate, pray hesitate!
| Tread not upon this course!
| What follows sweet is heart's remorse!
|
| Those lines afar you judged so straight
| Are crooked yet and coarse. 
| Mimic, dear mate, pray hesitate!
|
| You'll gain a head in broad divorce,
| But find astride your gait
| What follows sweet is heart's remorse.
|
| What lists like light will soon find weight
| If drawn from me my source.
| Mimic, dear mate, pray hesitate!
|
| This curse of mine for you awaits,
| if you persist, perforce;
| What follows sweet is heart's remorse.
|
| In throat my voice your lungs will break
| To find a song so hoarse.
| Mimic, dear mate, pray hesitate!
| What follows sweet is heart's remorse.

| On Sunday morning drive to your
|   Mountain cemetery,
| From black of road there rose the mists
|   To west where winds carry
| The ghosts the ground have failed to keep
|   Where earth lay bare through tar,
| Where oaks and willows reach to weep
|   But watch aghast afar,
| Decades through pores now poured in droves
|   As over them I drove,
| Their grasping tongues of fog unfurled,
|   With craft a road they wove,
| Until no longer did I drive but flee
|   From lane of memory.

| To begin is to make an end,
| Oh, LeAnna, of Anna's Leigh,
| Come with grin and play pretend
| The past is what we both agree.
|
| Oh, LeAnna, of Anna's Leigh,
| Despite the many faults of mine,
| The past is what we both agree
| Once marks are made on dotted line.
|
| Despite the many faults of mine,
| I'll try to love you just the same;
| Once marks are made on dotted line
| There's no one left but you to blame.
|
| I'll try to love you just the same
| But I implore you play this game:
| Pretty pretend, comely with grin;
| The end will yet begin again.

| Bay silt in city stone through time accrues
| towards the western course of concrete flow
| that sweeps from plain to sky in upward spews
| as grey-white spray arcs over wave to snow
| from heights on high to splash on mountain spine
| where valleyed pools so rise to drink their fill
| and shoot with sprouts through shoulders made of pine
| the roofs that empty crowds on streets and spill
| through hand to hand the layers stack'd from base
| to brick by brick til building lillies bred
| against the westward wall in flood's embrace
| where lips at last are wet in watershed;
|
| Let skyline mark where tide in climb was broke:
| Steeple, roof, needles pine and leaves of oak.

| Grey Heron, why not hide from winter's sting? 
| When your hunting ground turns 
|       from flows of blue to ice,
| The ducks and geese fly south
|       As soon as first wind blows, 
| The moles, they burrow down 
|       To wait alongside the mice,
| The deer disappear and 
|       Dream within hidden coves.
| 
| Each yields in retreat what they claim in Spring.
| But not you, oh Heron!
|       Not you, oh hunter Grey!
| Stalk low on drift of snow
|       With coiled neck of spear,
| Rouse from sleep the rodents
|       And make of them your prey,
| Steam each gasping breath 
|       With a speckling of fear. 
|
| Come warm winds, but winter yet lifts your wing.
| In flocks and song most birds
|       Find mate to take to nest;
| Lone you stand on silent shore
|       Of rushing river bank;
| Your song is sung in swoop
|       With fire from beating chest,
| The selfsame flame that rises
|       In cold upon your flank. 
|
| Every season makes of life its shape to sing. 
| The spring shapes honeysuckle
|       And the lazy chirps of thrush, 
| Summer is strawberry
|       And robin eggs of fay,
| Then autumn with the crow 
|       And pumpkin in the brush
| Yet winter makes but one
|       The mighty Heron Grey.

| The shape of wind in blades of grass,
|     Invisible heartbeat,
| I watch your dance from windowed room
|    In rising summer heat,
| Your pressured pulse that skips through sky
|     With history unseen,
| I wonder where this prologue starts,
|     what ancient chorus scene
| Announced your birth on fertile Earth
|    and blew the trumpet loud;
| Who called to you from great beyond
|    to tend this court of cloud?
| What sight will see your silent state
|    which spans expanse in dark?
| What ears will hear your solid plea
|    which leaves in naught its mark?
| What moment did you rise to life? 
|    What second do we praise?
| Your source, like form, is hidden close
|    In foggy, timeless haze. 
| In tracing back your tangled threads
|     they twine around and spool;
| Each point begins with points before
|     Always as if by rule.

| The day I sat by death's grey bed,
| I told a story both green and true
| Of city bricks stacked proud and red,
| Of silver paths the stars imbue
| With golden hue we might have tread.
| Your breath though blew there cold and blue.
|
| I spoke the words to yellow skin
| And told of days in white to come.
| Your mouth, with specks of purple grin,
| And fingers stretched so pale and numb,
| My name, you said, so clear, so thin--
| With final grasp, in black succumb.
| 
| Oh--Father, Father--brass horns blare!
| You string your harp with diamond thread
| And leave in me this slate despair!
| What crystal tears in eyes now shed?
| What pearl is formed by sightless stare?
| What platinum found in prayers pled? 
|
| The oak around your body wraps
| As shoots of pine through spine are grown.
| In loam the roots will bind your scraps
| Despite the flowers laid on stone.
| Each time I come a stem I snap, 
| For only Earth deserves your bone.

| On river shore the poor in tents are stored
|    To keep from sight their score.
| Above and north, the city steeples meet 
| To speak in sermons ever indiscrete
|     for sheep they so ignore.
| 
| They fight with roar, yet beaten, kiss through gore;
| From barrel fired dream, north they look for more,
| The city lights too far a source of heat
|    For life on river shore. 
|
| In winter months they paint on skin a whore,
| And every one despite what silence swore.
|     In life they all must cheat,
|     Become their own deceit,
| To win a war for land they all abhor:
|     Their home on river shore.

| The world that spins about its point,
|     That spun from loom these days,
| The one from sun that does anoint
|     As thread from time decays.
| I plucked a flower morning come
|     To save its life from woe.
| It wilted under press of thumb
|     In dying afterglow.
| Its soul through sweetly scented air
|     In secret met the gloam.
| Such poor design, so frail this share
|     That beauty makes a home.
| That afternoon we met at last
|     Though I with empty hand.
| There time removed from us amassed
|     The knots it wove through strands.
| Like vapor mist to sky dissolved
|     I wept at our good-bye,
| To see your eyes from dreams resolved
|     With nothing to reply.
