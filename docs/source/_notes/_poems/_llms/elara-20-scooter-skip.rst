Quiver crack below the pale blue hands and cartwheel limp to gushing bone.

Whisper slant beneath the striped green ears and pogo bounce to whistling dust.

Tremble tilt across the sticky bright face and hopscotch drop to pulsing mud.

Flutter bend beyond the silent sharp truths and somersault slip to pounding void.

Flicker dash inside hollowed cries, and tumble hush, to beating stars.
