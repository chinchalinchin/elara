NATURE

Autumn

| Oh! If I could touch an inch of Autumn
|       And measure Fall in feet,
| I might scale its depths to chart the bottom
|       And feel the Winter heat.
| Alas, no meters mark by foot the path
|       Through wooded maze of trees
|           Where leaves like life will wilt
|               In winded wake of wrath
|           In gusts blown cruel and dumb
|        To lay at feet to span each foot
| The dust each clever leaf here does become.
|
| As seasons pass and cast
|       My bone layered into stone,
| Let August dig for me a grave in brown
|       Barrow beneath her loam.
| Pray not a lover find these shards on shore
|       I am no edge to skip
|           Atop the waves of fancy
|               But under weight sunk roar
|           Where, offset, tides will rise
|       To breach the sodden dike
| And drown with wave the lazing lovers' sigh.
|
| To life I came already old and grim
|           But now the chill sets in;
| Each breath in gasp dispels to steam
|           Of Spring now waning thin.

Ode to the Heron

| Grey Heron, why not hide from winter's sting?
| When hunting ground then turns
|       From flows of blue to ice,
| The geese and ducks go south
|       As wind begins to blow,
| Then moles will burrow down
|       To wait beside the mice,
| The deer though disappear,
|       Their dreams in hidden coves.
|
| All retreat and yield what they claim in Spring.
| Oh! Heron! All but one!
|       Not you, oh hunter Grey!
| Stalk low on drift of snow
|       With coiled neck of spear,
| To rouse the sleeping rats
|       And feast upon your prey,
| To steam their gasping breath
|       With scream of speckled fear.
|
| The seasons switch, yet winter lifts your wing.
| In flocks and song most birds
|       Find mate to take to nest;
| Lone you stand, silent shore
|       Of rushing river bank;
| Your song is sung in swoop
|       With fire from beating chest,
| The selfsame flame that rises
|       In cold upon your flank.
|
| Each season makes of life its shape to sing.
| The Spring so shapes the buds
|       And lazy chirping thrush,
| The summer, berry red
|       And robin eggs of fay,
| Then Autumn crows of black
|       In pumpkin laden brush,
| Yet winter makes but one,
|       The mighty Heron Grey.

A Sonnet for Cumberland MD

| Bay silt in city stone through time accrues
| along the western course of concrete flow
| that sweeps from plain to sky in upward spews
| as grey-white spray arcs over wave to snow
| from heights on high and splash on mountain spine
| where valleyed pools in rising drink their fill
| and shoot with sprouts through shoulders made of pine
| the roofs that empty crowds on streets and spill
| through hand to hand the layers stacked from base
| to wedded brick til building lillies bred
| against the westward wall in flood's embrace
| where lips at last are wet in watershed;
|
| Let skyline mark where tide in climb was broke:
| Steeple, roof, needles pine and leaves of oak.

Landscapes

| Oh, hapless world, the butcher's block,
|   The sickle, scythe, harpoon,
| The barren fields, the culled livestock,
|   The blood red harvest moon.
|
| The ocean deep, a darkened heart,
|   A sore that festers cold,
| A slumbered age, a violent art,
|   Into all things behold.
|
| The forests wild, the stalking hunt,
|   The arrow cut from stone,
| The bloody rib, the brutal grunt,
|   A death in whimpered groan.
|
| The mountain peaks, a falling height,
|   The air in sky dissolved,
| A winter wind, a bitter blight,
|   Let no sin be absolved.
|
| The city streets, the graveyard paths,
|   The linen beds of wards,
| The gowns of white, the final baths,
|   The oak in coffin boards.

TIME 

The World That Spins


| The world that spins about its point,
|     That spun from loom these days,
| The one from sun that does anoint
|     As thread from time decays.
| I plucked a flower morning come
|     To save its life from woe.
| It wilted under press of thumb
|     In dying afterglow.
| Its soul through sweetly scented air
|     In secret met the gloam.
| Such poor design, so frail this share
|     That beauty makes a home.
| That afternoon we met at last
|     Though I with empty hands.
| There time removed from us amassed
|     The knots it wove through strands.
| Like vapor mist to sky dissolved
|     I wept at our good-bye,
| To see your eyes from dreams resolved
|     With nothing to reply.

On The Origin of Wind

| The shape of wind in blades of grass,
|     Invisible heartbeat,
| I watch your dance from windowed room
|    In rising summer heat,
| Your pressured pulse that skips through sky
|     With history unseen,
| I wonder where this prologue starts,
|     what ancient chorus scene
| Announced your birth on fertile Earth
|    and blew the trumpet loud;
| Who called to you from great beyond
|    to tend this court of cloud?
| What sight will see your silent state
|    which spans expanse in dark?
| What ears will hear your solid plea
|    which leaves in naught its mark?
| What moment did you rise to life?
|    What second do we praise?
| Your source, like form, is hidden close
|    In foggy, timeless haze.
| In tracing back your tangled threads
|     they twine around and spool;
| Each point begins with points before
|     Always as if by rule.

Plots

| In time their plot was touched by dark.
| Began the page this meadow scene
| where blades of grass were tall and stark.
|
| A tired arc, they met in park
| To kiss beneath the twilight queen;
| In time their plot was touched by dark.
|
| They stole away on sudden lark,
| Exchanged the words from whispered lean
| Where blades of grass were tall and stark.
|
| So happy their stock, neighbors remark,
| Yet seem is such to lose its sheen,
| In time their plot was touched by dark.
|
| Yet faded years ignored their spark
| In death they died forever seen
| Where blades of grass were tall and stark.
|
| In ground, their bodies disembark
| And leave behind a hole dug clean.
| In time their plot was touched by dark,
| Where blades of grass were tall and stark.

LeAnna's Pantoum

| To begin is to make our end,
| Oh, LeAnna, of Anna's Leigh,
| Come with grin and play pretend
| The past is what we both agree.
|
| Oh, LeAnna, of Anna's Leigh,
| Despite the many faults of mine,
| The past is what we both agree
| Once marks are made on dotted line.
|
| Despite the many faults of mine,
| I'll try to love you just the same;
| Once marks are made on dotted line
| There's no one left but you to blame.
|
| I'll try to love you just the same
| But I implore you play this game:
| Pretty pretend, comely with grin;
| Our end will yet begin again.
