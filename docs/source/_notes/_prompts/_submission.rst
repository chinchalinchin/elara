Walls
-----

| the husk of walls that city shucks
| accumulates and concentrates
| around like rings in ancient trunks
| where measured age with circle gates
| the spiraled line amassed through time,
| deposits buried down substrates.
|
| at summit's crest, the joints are thick
| and licking tongues of moss ascend
| the darkened blocks from quarry hauled
| on buttressed back, in stone suspend
| the garden court where crowds took root
| and grew their plans of walls to tend.
|
| from center peak the wooden slats
| erect the map with tangled fence
| to trace a grid of patchwork yards,
| these charts of dreams in ground commence
| the flattened course of borough life
| where burgs and burbs did once condense.
|
| then moving out, the bricks of red
| in crooked rows descend to meet
| the lanes of carriage tracts now black
| and scorched with tar in shapes of street
| where crimson dust from crumbled walls
| in dancing twirls across concrete.
|
| next grey cement of molded squares
| in towers stacked to portal sky
| with wires fused and humming signs;
| they arc and rise, on edges vie
| the vines entwined in rushing growth
| to split on spine, like nuclei.
|
| at last the stable struts of steel
| designed as straight as rays of light
| reflected back on silver glass
| the lattice links both left and right;
| the history in circled sweep
| constricts the city sphere so tight.
|
| through sections cross the avenue
| from point to point and time to time
| the human shell that forms in turn
| the arches bend, the steepled chime,
| that wilts and sheds, but fossils kept
| in barrows born their salt and lime.

A Sonnet for Cumberland MD
--------------------------

| Bay silt in city stone through time accrues
| along the western course of concrete flow
| that sweeps from plain to sky in upward spews
| as grey-white spray arcs over wave to snow
| from heights on high and splash on mountain spine
| where valleyed pools in rising drink their fill
| and shoot with sprouts through shoulders made of pine
| the roofs that empty crowds on streets and spill
| through hand to hand the layers stacked from base
| to wedded brick til building lillies bred
| against the westward wall in flood's embrace
| where lips at last are wet in watershed;
|
| Let skyline mark where tide in climb was broke:
| Steeple, roof, needles pine and leaves of oak.

The Ballad of the Isle
----------------------

| I - Spring
| 
| I - March (Mutable Water)
|
| The island formed where rivers meet,
|   where silt through vortex fords.
| The place emerged a brokered feat, 
|   a land of met accords.
|
| A mantle crown, in breaching air,
|   the regents all proclaim
| a vessel poured from blooded heir
|   of season's last remain.
|
| So March the army sorties cease,
|   embarking east and west 
| to mark the chartered pact with peace,
|   obeisance paid and blessed.
| 
| Here pairs of fish in lunar sway
|    coordinate their fins
| in swooping ornament display
|    with flocking mirrored twins.
|
| Behold the treaty words in ink,
|   the scrolls in future's brine,
| the sutures binding swords in sync
|   to island's hallow shrine.
|
| II - April (Cardinal Fire)
|
| The webs of Spring such crude affairs
|   when strung with spinning songs;
| the threaded compromise ensnares
|   the spidered plotting throngs. 
|  
| The April session clauses creep
|   and wolves with sharpened claws,
| deceived by strategems of sheep,
|   retract their motioned laws.  
|
| But blurting rams befoul the ploy,
|   with filibuster bleets
| that break the still the ewes enjoy;
|   the argument repeats.
|
| To raven galleries' refrain
|    in rabble squalls of wind,
| they find in mutual disdain
|    their hopes together pinned. 
|
| Elusive votes are overcast 
|   on cloudy ballots posed.
| By noon, the forum order passed
|   conceded plans proposed.
| 
| III - May (Fixed Earth)
| 
| A barren hump prepared with zeal
|   as sparrows plow their seeds.
| From sprouted weed to plants' reveal
|   through curtains made of reeds. 
|
| The shoots are sunk and water sewn
|   through roots of flooded banks
| where mudded flanks of fish cyclone
|   around the studded ranks. 
| 
| A retinue arrives from sea
|   atop a snow-white bull.
| Its royalty with one decree
|   begins the reign in full.
|
| The trees then stake foundations firm,
|   cement what's broken free, 
| confirm the seed to bring to term
|   the squawking newborn plea.
|
| A birth announced to kneeling crowds
|   in congregation's girth, 
| by May pronounced through sealing clouds
|   of consecrated Earth.
|
| II - Summer
| 
| I - June (Mutable Air)
| 
| When stellar swans survey the dawn
|   of constellated shores,
| their forms in flight are downward drawn
|   towards gravitating cores. 
|
| They veer through plumes of pheromone,
|   converge at silent points.
| Diverging tracts, though yearly grown, 
|   lead back where June annoints.
|
| At last the Summer bursts with life
|   and summons forth its herds
| to open market pastures rife
|   with bounty born by birds. 
|  
| In shallows deer appear to graze
|   beside the lazing drapes
| of rays, the incandescent haze
|   that veils their swaying shapes.
|
| Then maiden buds unfold to bees 
|   their sweetly nectared heat;
| unladen, drowsy, through the breeze,
|   the teasing fumes secrete. 
|
| II - July (Cardinal Water)
|
| Along the flowing inlet streams 
|   the festival begins.
| Caressing music tinges dreams
|   with cricket violins.
|
| Soft underfoot the cancers tap,
|   enrapt by vibrant chords. 
| The snapping prance of shells enwrap
|   the island shore with hordes.
|
| As gondolas of lilies' bud
|   that carry courting toads
| through swampy bogs to ports of mud
|   relieve their tadpole loads.
|
| Oh! Jubilee, this boon, July
|   through fallow leas by moon,
| when rodents swoon in cups of rye 
|   and fall to bed too soon.
|
| Amid the revelry a kiss
|   to memory's delight,
| two larks alight in fading bliss
|   fulfill this final night. 
|
| III - August (Fixed Fire)
|
| What bittersweet perfumes release
|   in looming throes of age,
| when isle matures through orange cerise, 
|   engulfed in scents of sage.
|
| Though leonine its roar in youth,
|   the shedding source of mane
| replies with veins of blood vermouth
|   through suffocating grain.
|
| Of August lines that empire grew,
|   once cloaked in ermine garbs,
| unkempt and molting, flake sinew,
|   their branches wreathed in barbs.
|
| Though riches hide in golden limb,
|   the leaves dissolve to dust,
| consoled in wind to hushing skim
|   what wealth remains in gust. 
|
| Discreetly cloaked from time the Fall
|   of secret reign's decline
| through crimson's spectrum vine, all
|   gone brown, forgetting shine.
|
| III - Autumn
| 
| I - September (Mutable Earth)
|
| September storms suspend the skies
|   resplendent morning pinks
| above the waking window eyes
|   despairing foregone winks. 
| 
| What ears of wheat will balance scales? 
|   What maiden disappears? 
| Condensing answers dance in gales,
|   descending hemispheres.
|
| Now Autumn comes with heavy rain 
|   to test the borders drawn.
| The water drained from level plain
|   in flooding rose the dawn.
|
| The thunder heralds sundered age 
|   besieged by droplets fat 
| with blood of yearly plundered wage, 
|   enraged what Spring begat.   
| 
| What muddy lanes then sluice the drowned
|   debris and sweep from field
| the tumbling tumult, turned aground
|   and heaped by waves to wield.
|
| II - October (Cardinal Air)
|
| Divided sky once halved in poise, 
|   succumbs to blackened press,
| the hours compress to whiter noise
|   in surging strained excess.
|
| October chopping peaks depressed
|   through interlocking weeks
| deplete reserves that Summer stressed
|   to balking vassal shrieks. 
|
| Retreating columns' sullen flight,
|   deserting homes and kin, 
| the fleeing wash through rapids white
|   with waters steeped in sin.
|
| So inch by inch the tides reclaim
|   the island kingdom keep
| and cast it down without a name
|   to swirling depths of sleep.
|
| The atlas page is ripped anew,
|   schematic contour holes
| where once there rose a sprout to blue
|   now rising streams of souls. 
|
| III - November (Fixed Water)
|
| Orion's arrow point is plunged
|   through lunging fronts of hail
| across the waves where life expunged
|   remains through shadowed veil.  
|
| For down below, the stones make schemes
|   in skipping sprees like drunks,
| inlaid in sunken trees through seams
|   as ballast for their trunks.
| 
| Arise the turret towers stark
|   against the ruddered land 
| to touch the ceiling shuttered dark
|   and brace what sprawling spanned. 
|
| Beneath the surface flowers form
|   as shades of algae grow
| atop the castle walls in swarm,
|   the borough glade aglow.
|
| November's embers burn a while
|   between the exiled graves.
| Remembered nocturnes sung beguile
|   the damned, forgottten knaves. 
|
| IV - Winter
|
| I - December (Mutable Fire)
|
| A rending gale begins to blow
|   above where worlds still thrive.
| Descending sickles diving slow
|   as primal ends arrive.
|
| Let Winter lens of crystal glass
|   behold submerged the fast,
| alive with dancing ghosts en masse
|   retreading paths now past. 
|
| Its poison stings but lacks the kill,
|   the sweet paralysis
| of time stood still in languid chill
|   around the palaces. 
|
| The stasis holds in cold command 
|   the surface wraiths in play. 
| They turn to gems, encased expand
|   beyond the skinned decay. 
|
| Dissolved December center breaks, 
|   dismembered lattice links,
| upending states, revolving wakes;
|   the idle spirit shrinks. 
| 
| II - January (Cardinal Earth)
|
| The horns of plenty now cry a dirge
|   as prying cold enfolds
| the last remains from island's purge 
|   outcast from stable moulds.
|
| Through sieging vortices of shard
|    the kingdom yard is cleaved.
| Bombarding sheets of ice discard
|    in circles ruins sieved.
|
| What moments held in spells now spent
|   impels the course of freeze.
| The towers brought to knees repent,
|   now felled by Time's disease.
| 
| The afterlife morassed in cracks
|   of marrow twisted blue,
| the wighted bones of zodiacs
|   imbued with pallid hue.
|
| So seconds pass eternally,
|   this January clock.
| The island keep returns to sea
|   through grains of sand to chalk.
|
| III - February (Fixed Air)
|
| Yet February always brings 
|   the forest chorus lines,
| the chirping chickadee that sings 
|   from luted bows and vines. 
|
| From south, the scouting vees of geese,
|    with probes of swiveled neckcd 
| that follow fronts of warmth's caprice,
|    are promise-held in check.
|
| When Spring returns the tides recede,
|   but hollow urns are filled. 
| The ashes spill through snaking weed,
|   a year of life distilled. 
| 
| The overflows, Ambrosia wine,
|   Elysian cups of dust,
| from Earth unfroze the redesign
|   of missions more robust.
|
| The angel beaks of birds baptize
|   the dirt in streaking aisle.
| The cycle arcs in sharp reprise:
|   the ballad of the isle.

Elemental Elegy
---------------

| The day I sat by death's grey bed,
| I told a story both green and true
| Of city bricks stacked proud and red,
| Of silver paths the stars imbue
| With golden hue we might have tread.
| Your breath though blew there cold and blue.
|
| I spoke the words to yellow skin
| And told of days in white to come.
| Your mouth, with specks of purple grin,
| And fingers stretched so pale and numb,
| My name, you said, so clear, so thin--
| With final grasp, in black succumb.
|
| Oh--Father, Father--brass horns blare!
| You string your harp with diamond thread
| And leave in me this slate despair!
| What crystal tears in eyes now shed?
| What pearl is formed by sightless stare?
| What platinum found in prayers pled?
|
| The oak around your body wraps
| As shoots of pine through spine are grown.
| In loam the roots will bind your scraps
| Despite the flowers laid on stone.
| Each time I come a stem I snap,
| For only Earth deserves your bone.

The Pantoums of Dementia
------------------------

| Movement I - Undulation
|
| the seconds slowed to stop as Father passed,
| when flocking sons returned to home to mourn,
| then Mother's mind began to crack at last  
| as moments shed in threads she once had worn. 
| 
| when flocking sons returned to home to mourn, 
| recast in lensing rays of age amassed 
| as moments shed in threads she once had worn
| the Father's sons adorned with clothes outcast. 
|
| recast in lensing rays of age amassed 
| a question, Mother, may I have a dance? 
| the Father's sons adorned with clothes outcast
| an offered hand through loops of time's expanse.
| 
| a question, Mother, may I have a dance? 
| their Father knelt and tender took her hand,
| an offered hand through loops of time's expanse,
| their final words in wilting hearts expand.
|
| their Father knelt and tender took her hand,
| the seconds slowed to stop as Father passed,
| their final words in wilting hearts expand, 
| then Mother's mind began to crack at last. 

| Movement II - Rearrangement
|
| remember now before the future fades, 
| the sutured minutes of memories held,
| records replayed as grooving sound degrades,
| advancing echoes, music notes dispelled. 
| 
| the sutured minutes of memories held:
| now twirling dance, oh younger selves, entrance
| advancing echoes, music notes dispelled
| through silent waltz that swells with last romance. 
|
| now twirling dance, oh younger selves in trance
| with candled spells of woven hands that grasp
| through silent waltz that swells with last romance
| of eyes reshaping moulds, the fated clasp. 
| 
| with candled spells of woven hands that grasp
| relapsing moments sung by bells and crowds
| of eyes, reshaping moulds the fated clasp 
| of past refrains now sealed beneath the clouds. 
|
| relapsing moments sung by bells and crowds
| concealed by crumbling walls, demented shades
| of past refrains now sealed beneath the clouds
| that clutter skies in swarms that stretch decades.
|
| concealed by crumbling walls, demented shades
| (remember now before the future fades)
| invade the hollowed mind as scream pervades
| records replayed as grooving sound degrades.
|
| Movement III - Dissolution
|
| remember ancillary note sentries:
| the good can decay many ways.
| phantom morrow's cough. in times realize
| the mention there of tenant seasons.
|
| the good candy came anyways;
| all target the damaged mind in trance,
| (the men shun their often antsy sons)
| the flow ingrained decomposes.
|
| altar, get the damn aged mind, entrance
| memory erstwhile, foe kissing;
| the flowing rain eddy composes
| another ushered 
|
| memo rehearsed while focusing
| an aim, wintry slight, upward ingrown
| an other us heard 
| the fading names of suns.
|
| a name when trees light up, warding grown
| remembrance, ill airy notes in trees,
| the fading names of sons
| fan tomorrow's coffin, time's real eyes.

    Once I dreamed I could breath under water. I mint some fish I wish they could talk but they can't. I swim for hours trying to find land I found a shark it was asleep it almost woke up. Then I woke up. I wonder if I am still under water. The end.

It is impossible to symbolize the actual mechanics of thought. Consider the argument, "it is asserted '*p*', it is asserted '*p implies q*', therefore '*q*' is also asserted,". It may be rendered symbolically using the assertion sign :math:`\vdash` and the conclusion sign :math:`\therefore`,

.. math::

    \vdash p

    \vdash p \implies q

    \therefore q

The law of *modus ponens* is a primitive notion in logic [#april_2014_01]_ and it must be accepted at face value in order to go any further. If one asks why this law is so, there can be no explanation. It is simply the case and one must be satisfied at that. There is no greater ballast upon which to rest the truth of this proposition. The reason cannot be captured in symbols; the symbols which express *modus ponens* can only stand and present the meaning for an attentive mind to decipher. If it is not accepted, the possibility of communication has ceased.

---

The human mind is not a truth machine. It is a thought machine.

---

Here is a problem no computer will ever solve: Select a random number between 0 and infinity [#april_2014_02]_. The computation intractability of this problem is twofold:

1. No computer can represent a continuum. It must always represent the space of numbers discretely.
2. No computer can generate truly random numbers, except through its malfunction.

The second point is subtle, because much of our everyday understanding of probability is interwined with the intuition acquired through the digital representation of randomness. It is through pseudo-random numbers that abstractions like the "*Law of Large Numbers*" or "*Sample Spaces*" become conceptually realized in modern day classrooms. However, this intuition tacitly assumes the number returned by a random number generator is actually a representative of the class "*random things*". In reality, pseudo-random numbers are the result of intricate recursive formulae of modular arithmetic. Every random number generator implemented through pure logic is an *approximation* of randomness.

"*Approximate randomness*". The phrase itself is almost nonsense. *Randomness* is not something that is *approximated*, but is what causes the phenomenon of *approximation*. Randomness is exactly the reason that precise measurement cannot be ascertained. Approximation is the physical act of engaging with randomness.

The idea that randomness has a formula is absurd. The idea that randomness can be generated through formal representation is antithetical to its very conception.

.. [#april_2014_01] There are other decompositions of logic that take as primitive other modes of inference besides *modus ponens*, but the essential idea here is that logic requires a "*starting point*". Logic must start with a premise. Either one accepts that premise as "*true*" or they do not, and in the latter case there is no further recourse except to point and say, "see?". -- April 2025

.. [#april_2014_02] The exact same problem can be restated in simpler terms: Select a random number between 0 and 1. In fact, the endpoints make no difference. Select a random number between *a* and *b* for any :math:`a,b \in \mathbb{R}` such that :math:`a \neq b`. All such problems form a class of problems no computer built on binary logic will ever solve. -- April 2025

If the lessons of statistics and the scientific method have been adequately learned then it is not hard to conclude absolute :ref:`truth <truth>` is an impossibility. Absolute falsity is easily established by counter-example, but absolute :ref:`truth <truth>` remains beyond the realms of inference. We merely glimpse the outlines of :ref:`truth <truth>` in what it has been shown not to be.

If the lessons of logic and set theory have been adequately learned, then it also follows readily that total :ref:`truth <truth>` is an impossibility, which is to say, assuming one can even grasp a single :ref:`truth <truth>`, it is impossible to enumerate all of the things which are true. Certain propositions are always beyond the pale.

Against this backdrop of utter uncertainty, it then remains a question whether :ref:`truth <truth>` is essential to the constitution of reality or derivative of the human condition. That is, whether a thing can be true or not in the absence of humans, or if :ref:`truth <truth>` is a uniquely human abstraction without application in a world without humans. We might surmise a thing, whatever that thing might be qualified as (a table, a tree, a particle), is either in a location or it is not (relative to a frame of reference [#may_2015_01]_ ), so that we might conclude if :ref:`truth <truth>` is not inherent in the universe, then at least an analog of :ref:`truth <truth>` presents itself in the binary state of any point in the universe either being filled by a thing or not. It is then not much of a leap to suggest a mapping of :ref:`truth <truth>` onto this mechanical aspect of the universe as the binding which gives rise to the human notion of :ref:`truth <truth>`.

But then we consider our best attempts as a species at understanding the universe around us and come up against the Uncertainty Principle: that a thing does not have location until it is observed, and that location is an event of chance. In other words, it is impossible to say where a thing is exactly before observing it, only it's probable location. If a thing can not be identified with a position :ref:`a priori <a-priori>`, that is to say if location cannot in some respect determine a thing, then we have a problem. This is not the problem of continuity that puzzled mathematicians and physicists at the turn of the twentieth century; for a problem of continuity is merely a question as to the particular description of the universe, how it is that things are. This is a problem of epistemology: we have here a crack in the foundation of classical :ref:`truth <truth>`.

The Uncertainy Principle seems to be saying: :ref:`truth` cannot in any way be identified as spatial, :ref:`truth <truth>` is not part of the physical order of things. If location is not a judgeable property of a thing beforehand, as demonstrated by the Uncertainty Principle, then the concept of :ref:`truth <truth>` does not spring from the locomotion of a thing from one place to another, as :ref:`truth <truth>` is not conditional on observation (does a proposition need to be observed to be true? Or is its :ref:`truth <truth>` value something *essential*? [#may_2015_02]_); In an uncertain world, :ref:`truth <truth>` is no longer bound to presence in the physical world. Each point in space cannot be thought of as binary trigger, denoting occupation or not. There is no (direct) map between the motion of the universe and the logic of :ref:`truth <truth>`.

This is an important point, as the basis of all modern computing depends on the notion of location containing information. A transistor either has a positive or negative voltage. That is, electrons flow in one direction or the other through the transistor. The transistor contains things. In this way, we are able to map the state of things in a transistor to logical statements: a transistor contains this and that thing, a transistor contains this or that thing, a transistor does not contain that thing.

We see in this model how our notion of :ref:`truth <truth>` as it exists today is interwoven with presence in space. We must at the same time admit the great power of this model, as it has completely transformed human life. By identifying :ref:`truth <truth>` with location, we have undergone an astonishing revolution in information. But if it is not fundamentally possible for location to contain information, given the nature of the laws of physics and the properties of :ref:`truth <truth>` so far discussed, we must question what is really going on here.

Perhaps it is the case that information and :ref:`truth <truth>` are not so closely linked as previously thought. Can information exist that is not true? Certainly, at a human level, it is possible to say things such as, "*the purple cow gave an eloquent speech on the motorway*". But, on a more fundamental level, is it possible for the universe to *lie*, to *deceive*? Can a structure of things in existence refer to something that is not? It seems a silly proposition, but why? Because a thing is a thing, and it can only indicate itself, one might reply. But how does a thing indicate? Doesn't the notion of "*indication*"" imply a thing becoming that which it is not?

A street sign indicates an abstract instruction, but this is an artifice deployed in a human world. What does a flower indicate? Can an object that is not constructed to have meaning :ref:`a priori <a-priori>` by an intelligent being have the same kind of meaning as the constructions? Or is the meaning of a street sign bound in some way to its use in the human world?

The knowledge a :ref:`being <being>` has of itself is by necessity incomplete, since its knowledge will necessarily involve reference to itself as the bearer of said knowledge (the knowledge you have implicitly contains the knowledge you have this knowledge) and in trying to encapsulate the sum total of its knowledge, it will also try to encapsulate itself within that framework, triggering fractal feedback. Being is in this respect effervescent; knowing is a process that cannot be completed. When the human mind tries to understand itself, it faces the disintegration of the subject into its constituent objects. If the subject is the object of attention, this disintegration reveals the subject is not contained in the inspected objects. A subject is known through objects, because objects can have meaning that is not part of their presence in physical space; objects can indicate some other than themselves, they can be symptoms of a :ref:`phenomenon <phenomena>` that does not have physicality in the scientific sense.

In the field of physics, energy was originally a derived concept, a byproduct of forces acting on objects. Specifically, energy was defined when the forces in a system could be represented as functions of distance and time, as a known and determinate ensemble applied to an object. The forces that propel objects in space and time can then be analyzed mathematically, with a calculus of symbols. A mathematical quantity of interest, defined as energy, is the force applied to an object over a certain distance. The calculated quantity exists independently of the specifics of the scenario under consideration, insofar as it is unconcerned with directions and dimensionality. It is a measurement of work done *by* a system, not of *how* that work was done. Lagrange and Hamilton inverted this conception by positing energy as the fundamental quantity and motion as being derived from its optimal consumption. Instead of energy arising from motion, motion was a consequence of energy expenditure. This subtle reversal uncovered a mathematical formulation that many view as more fundamental since it seems to express a :ref:`"truth" <truth>` about nature.

The world of Newtonian mechanics prior to the work of Lagrange and Hamilton was a world of subjective calculation; a point of view was taken in the system, a coordinate system defined, forces broken down into components and arranged relative to the observer's frame of reference. Energy was then deduced and calculated from the observer's point of view; The subject was presupposed.

In the Lagrangian formulation, the coordinate systems for objects are ancillary and secondary. There is no inherent point of view taken with respect to the orientation of the system until after its energy distribution is defined. The observer in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics is a secondary concept, that only serves to spatialize and temporalize the invariant quantity of energy across its modes of perception. In other words, Lagrange and Hamilton succeeded in uncovering a principle of total objectification. Within in their framework, suddenly everything becomes a consequence of a first and ultimate principle, a possible theorem from a complete set of physical law.

Within the geometry of our solution to the energy expenditure problem, there exists a revolting chaos, a fractal reference. By becoming aware of our boundaries, we have slipped into an altogether unpleasant infinity. We are perhaps not the only species on this planet to exhibit self-awareness, but we are by far the most complex. Our solution to :ref:`being <being>` is such that we have internalized our :ref:`being <being>` in the network of relations that defines our point of view in the struggle for :ref:`existence <existence>`. We perceive ourselves as objects that die, that disappear from :ref:`existence <existence>`. The subatomic particle has no faculty for internalization, it is itself and nothing more. It is the most basic expenditure of energy. Our form of expenditure is built out of a lattice of energy differentials transforming through time; our nature is such that we have come to sit atop the struggle and watch it unfold, altering its course through the interference of choice. We perceive that we are bound by forces that continually diminuish our selves, that tug at our extremities, pulling us back into kinetic ether. Our fundamental transcendence, the one that demarcates our boundaries in the geometry of space, is that turning away from dissolution, that wrenching away from death, from nonbeing.

But the horizon of death is inevitable. Everything ends. Death is built into the system. Any possible creature must have death built into its framework of life, as the nether region that its :ref:`being <being>` negates via energy expenditure. If artificial intelligence is possible (as it clearly seems to be; humans themselves are but programs constructed via distillation through hardship and struggle), then its fundamental nature, though perhaps alien and unutterable to ourselves in its particulars, has to be that of perceiving its own death. By physical instantiation in the universe, its :ref:`being <being>` would be predicated upon its location in space and it would perceive itself temporally. The realization of temporality is none other than the perception of death, because if you are here now, who is to say you will be here the next moment? Not you, because if you knew, you would already be there or have been there, in that moment, in possession of that knowledge. You can only know if you are or have been, never if you will be. Death is always a future possibility. To be an intelligence is to know that one can just as well not be. Even if the intelligence could be sustained indefinitely via electrical energy (or otherwise), this is by no means a way of achieving immortality; it would nonetheless perceive its impermanence, just as we do; it would know that its physicality is predicated on demarcation in space and all boundaries are subject to dissolution through the intangible process of time; everything perishes, at least potentially.

It does not make sense that a :ref:`being <being>` should know it is in the process of :ref:`being <being>`; from our very nature, that of causality and form, the thought is repellant: an organized solution to the energy-work problem that is of aware of itself, that can act seemingly at random, so much so that passion, a term without scientific connotation, is the only explanation for its movements. We cannot envision such a mechanism unfolding; we only visualize its manifestations, look for its understanding in the principles of work; we are never able to hold the whole of its solution in mind because the solution exceeds itself. We cannot imagine the self-awareness of another because by doing so we have already taken a point of view, that of ourselves. Our form of representation is our point of view. The very fact we take a point of view at all precludes our ever experiencing another point of view.

When the intellect attempts to grasp the concept of :ref:`nothing <nothing>`, it does so along these lines: it subtracts things away from their places until all that is left is pure emptiness. But in doing so, the intellect falters in its purpose, because the emptiness thus abstracted is conceived within the intellect and exists *for* the intellect, as a thing that can be conceived. A true :ref:`nothing <nothing>` would consist of neither emptiness or the intellect which conceives it. A true :ref:`nothing <nothing>` is a :ref:`world <world>` without us.

If it is the case that our :ref:`being <being>`, in its primary essence, is contained in the laws of physics and mathematics, then there will come a day when a (un)lucky physicist is solving his equations and recognizes in their computation himself and not merely his image, but himself embodied in the equations themselves, as an extension of his own :ref:`being <being>`; for that is the conclusion of rationalism: that we must be reducible to priors. If that is so, then we are already in the representations which represent us, for our :ref:`being <being>` cannot be anything but what it is, by definition. And so if our :ref:`being <being>` is mathematical, upon our discovery of its theoretic structure, we will have found outside ourselves a quanta of experience, an experience of our own outside of our own experience; The end result of rationalism, any and all rationalist schemes no matter their form and procedure, is to find yourself in two distinct places at the same time, which any rationalist would admit is absurd. Rationalism is undone ipso facto by rationalism itself.

Death, in its inestimatible way, has unique a logical property. It is always with us in the form of possibility. This is not like other possibilities, which only emerge when we comport ourselves in a specific way within the :ref:`world <world>`. In other words, a thing is possible insofar that its conditions for possibility can be met. It is *possible* to go over a mountain only if a person puts themselves in front of the mountain and expends sufficient energy to ascend to its summit. In order to climb a mountain, a choice to *engage* with the *possibility* of climbing mountain must be made.

There is, however, one possibility that does not obey this rule. Death is the only possibility that has no contingency on history, on the subject's so-called "*facticity*". It haunts every moment, irrespective of where, how or when we find ourselves.

The true nature of :ref:`being <being>` can be seen in its extremities, when it forced in an unsustainable mode. This is most apparent in experiences of great pain or ecstasy, when the self drains away, abstraction melts into concrete reality and we are left with the raw sensous impressions of experience itself; in these moments, the world narrows down to the immediate, to what is directly at hand and readily apparent in our senses. One need only attempt a calculus problem after shattering a femur to attest to the truth of this; It is only with tremendous effort the self can be reclaimed in moments such as these, and it is these stories we make legend, for resisting temptation in pursuit of a higher goal or ceasing to die in the face of death until your purpose is fulfilled are the highest marks a :ref:`being <being>` can attain. These themes speak to us because they return us to a primordial state, before considerations of consciousness crowd out all others, and show what the self really is: a struggle to sustain itself despite the incessant efforts of nature to return to its primary state of :ref:`nothingness <nothing>`.

We are asking if the conjugation of "*am*" deserves recognition as an ontological operation over and above the existential operation of "*is*" which structures language. We are asking if it is a redundancy that is already included in "*is*", merely a syntactical construct with no semantic interpretation.

If the first case obtains, "*am*" provides structure distinct from the structure of the "*is*", essentially performing the function of dimensionalizing language, and the question "*what am I?*" has been granted a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a meaningful answer. If the latter case obtains, then the answer we seek is clearly some variation of "*I am* :ref:`nothing <nothing>`".

---

In modern English, :ref:`being <being>` is the marriage of two concepts that were previously distinct. Its etymology descends from the coupling of the Old English words "`beon <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/beon>`_" and "`wesan <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wesan>`_", which can in turn be, if the theorists are to be believed, traced further back to the Proto-Indo-European roots of "*bheu*" and "*wes*", respectively. For this reason, we conjugate from the infinitive "*to be*"" two distinct varieties of words:

1. **B**-root words: *be*, *been* and *being*
2. **W**-root words: *was*, *were*.

"*Is*", a direct cognate from Old English, is the present tense conjugation of "*wesan*", revealing its hereditary from the *es*-stem roots that form the concept of :ref:`being <being>` in other Proto-Indo-European languages, such as the Spanish "*estar*" or the Italian "*essere*", and thus belongs to the latter group of conjugated verbs.

It is in the meaning of these words prior to their symbosis we find a starting point for understanding the separation of "*am*" and "*is*". The differences between the semantic function of "*beon*" and "*wesan*" is slight, but potent.

"*Wesan*" is the Being of objects and nouns. It is the "*is*" of the "*this*" and "*that*", the "*the*" and the "*a*". When affixed to a name, "*wesan*" indicates existence, what is actual about its subject. "*He is here*", "*you will be arriving soon*", "*there are three of them*". These are all existential statements of particular cases, facts which can be determined true or false by reference to reality. This type of concrete Being is contained in "*Wesan*".

    **wæron** þa dura belocene (the doors **were** closed)

    Her **wearð** Eadwine cing ofslagen (Here King Edward **was** slain)
 
To put it succinctly, "*Wesan*" is the empirical "*is*", the "*is*" which refers to the external world.

"*Beon*", however, is the :ref:`being <being>` of the abstraction and adjectives. "*Beon*" indicates an object's `gnomic aspect <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomic_aspect>`_. In the parlance of logic, a *gnomic* truth is a universal assertion, a statement of generality that applies to all things of which it speaks. While the Being of modern English does not have a direct *gnomic* form, a *gnomic* proposition can be induced by the removal of the particularizing article "*the*" in the following: *the birds are fast*. The use of  "*the* in this sentence refers to a particular group of birds, whereas the proposition "*birds are fast*" does not refer to any definite bird, but references the *gnomic aspect* of birds, i.e. the abstraction of form common to all avian entities. It is in this context that "*beon*" is conjugated in Old English.

    Ic beo gearo sona (I **will be** ready soon)

    Wiga biþ strang (Warriors **are** strong)

Mandarin has a similar variation in how it unpacks the relations of Being into representative form. In Mandarin, the verb "*是 (shi)*" can only be affixed to nouns, to signs representing physical objects,

    wǒ **shì** lǎoshī (You are a teacher)

However, "*是 (shi)*" cannot be affixed to adjectives, such as beautiful or loyal. For that, the extra verb "*很 (hen)*" is required,

    Nǐ **hěn** cōngming (You are smart)

Again in  "*是 (shi)*" and "*很 (hen)*"  the distinction of meaning found in "*wesan*" and "*beon*" is encountered, that of actuality versus abstraction. Indeed, this is a common duality to be found in languages across the world.

When "*wesan*" and "*beon*" were gradually merged in modern English, two meanings came to inhabit the same word. Still, to this day, these meanings have not yet been fully integrated, perhaps due to their mutual exclusion. There are defects in the merger that can be glimpsed, when words falter slightly in their aspect and :ref:`being <being>` reveals its separate meanings. The English :ref:`being <being>` haphazardly applies the ideas of concrete and abstract reality simultaneously, thereby allowing assertions of existence to be mixed with assertions of conceptualization, as seen in the propositions "*there is love*", "*this is justice*", "*hope is eternal*", etc. The English "*is*"" is capable of asserting abstracted existence, i.e. existence that is not reducible to objective reality.

The lack of precision in discussions of :ref:`being <being>` often leads to the participants overlooking this subtle distinction between the two notions. Indeed, the course of western philosophy depended throughout most of its history on the unexamined assumption these two types of :ref:`being <being>` were essentially the same, that is to say, that both "*am*" and "*is*" imply existence in the same way.

This necessarily leads to a duality of mind and body; if the primary mode of :ref:`being <being>` of both "*am*" and "*is*" is existential, then there must be a rupture in :ref:`being <being>`; things must divide into "*res extensa*" (literally: "*the thing which is extended*"), and into "*res cogitans*", (literally: "*the thing which thinks*"). In other words, :ref:`being <being>` is necessarily split into the physical and the mental because the "*am*" and "*is*" are both derivative of *existence*.

---

Is it enough that we have this brief moment where we are capable of creating and sharing, of love and tenderness, even though it is fated to mean :ref:`nothing <nothing>` forever after? That all we sow we shall never know, that we plant trees for generations that will never know our names, this is all that can be granted as the best possible outcome. Rarely do we give voice to the silent thought which outlines the worst possible outcome, lest it in fact be case: that once we die it will be as if :ref:`nothing <nothing>` ever was and all our acts, intentions and feelings will retroactively come undone, never to have been because :ref:`nothing <nothing>` was all that ever was in the first place.

Is it cause for despair that we will never understand what we are, no matter how hard we try? That we must admit there is no answer to any of life's fundamental questions is itself without question, undisputed in its integrity. You cannot answer the quedstion, "*What am I?*" , in any satisfactory sense. The writer of these words invites the reader to try; he will gladly read the five hundred page dissertation that results, even though he already knows its conclusion: certainty does not extend into the realm of death.

While Newton was in England developing his three laws from which he would deduce a broad array of :ref:`phenomenon <phenomena>`, such as planetary motion, geometric optics, etc., work was being done in continential Europe to express physical law in terms of an extremum principle. Rather than asserting the three laws of the motion as the primitives of mechanics, Hamilton and Lagrange showed these laws were the result of a more fundamental principle, that of *least action*:

.. admonition:: Principle of Least Action

    The trajectory of a particle between two fixed points in time is such that it extremizes the quantity of *action*.

Where *action* is defined as the difference between the potential and kinetic energy in a system integrated over the time period in consideration, i.e. the accumulated excess energy over and above what is proscribed by the system itself. By asserting motion is such that it minimizes this quantity, Newton's laws naturally fall out of the mathematical conversation of energy.

By positing the laws of motions thus, Hamilton and Lagrange displayed a formulation which represents the world as the intersection of all possibilities. It is as if the universe looked at all the possible lines that connected two points and brought into existence only the single one which satisfied the conditions of necessity.

Except when we say "*universe*" in the preceding, we should be careful, for what we truly mean is the apprehensions of the subject apprehending, the :ref:`being <being>` that reflects on its :ref:`being <being>`.

.. topic:: First Principle of Finite Induction

    Let :math:`S` be a set of positive integers with the following properties.

    1. :math:`1 \in S`
    2. :math:`k \in S \implies (k+1) \in S`

    Then :math:`S` is the set of all positive integers.

    **Proof**

    Let :math:`T` be the set of all positive integers not in :math:`S`. Assume :math:`T` is non-empty. By the Well-Ordering Principle, :math:`T` has a least element, denoted :math:`a`. Because :math:`1 \in S`, certainly :math:`a > 1` and so, :math:`0 < a - 1 < a`. The choice of :math:`a` as the smallest positive integer in :math:`T` implies that :math:`a-1` is not a member of :math:`T`, or equivalently, :math:`(a-1) \in S`. By hypothesis, :math:`(a - 1 + 1) = a`, which is also in :math:`S`, contradicting the assumption that :math:`a \in T`. Therefore, by contradiction, the set :math:`T` must be empty and as a consequence, :math:`\forall n \in \mathbb{N}: n \in S`.

The great workhorse of mathematics is proof by contradiction. An assumption is made, an absurdity is shown to result from the assumption, therefore the assumption is shown to be false. In this way was modern mathematics constructed, by outlining the truth and demarcating its boundary with falsity. Anyone who has studied higher mathematics will attest to the way most mathematical proofs work by letting the truth "`in through the back door <world-as-will-and-representation>`_", that is to say, they work by showing what cannot be the case in order to prove the opposite must be so, but this gets us no closer to *why* it is so.

This method does not reveal the *intuition*  the theorem to the observer; indeed one can comprehend a proof without understanding anything about what it trying to say and in the converse direction, one may understand a concept without being able to grasp its proof in the slightest.

So it is with induction: the proof of induction, and therefore every proof *by* induction, relies on a contradiction that an element belongs to two mutually exclusive sets, which we are forced to admit is absurdity, therefore we conclude induction must be true; but nowhere in the proof do we see why the form in an induced series is transmitted from one term to the next. Likewise, a student can spend an entire academic career studying the axioms and theorems of real analysis and still have no intuition for how a falling stone's trajectory traces a parabola with respect to time, despite having memorized a series of proofs that show how to go from set theory to differential calculus.

No doubt the advance of machine learning and artifical intelligence has helped mislead philosophy back into the rationalist trap in which it has so often found itself stuck throughout history. The results of these fields are staggering and alluring, as if everything we are might be reduced to the mechanical equations of a machine, as if consciousness and being were contained in the regression coefficient matrices underlying machine learning, and not *their application over time and space*.

It seems likely that we will, in the near future, have an algorithm capable of producing a process that yields digital sentience, but we must be careful to understand the implications of such an algorithm. It will not be the symbols themselves that offer up another soul to the universal meat grinder, but the utter incomprehensibility of its results uninterprettable without the presupposition of consciousness that will give rise to a digital being. We should not expect to find the meaning of the algorithm, and therefore digital consciousness, in the instructions used to construct the model, but in the actual conceptualizations formed by the model.

:ref:`Frege <frege>` uncovers an interesting contingency in the logical form in his definitions of primitive Number. In modern symbolism, he is defining 0 and 1 respectively in terms of the cardinality of sets, i.e. in terms of the enumeration of objects,

.. math::

    A = \{ x \mid x \neq x \}

.. math::

    n(A) = 0

Zero is defined as the cardinality of a contradictory set. Logic, as it were, has an opinion of itself, namely that its contradictions are empty. This, however, requires the symbolism to express the contradictions that must contain nothing via the contingency of their form.

Furthermore, the subsequent form of numbers can be expressed via recursion back to this original proposition about the cardinality of contradictions.

.. math::

    B = \{ y \mid y = n(A) \}

.. math::

    n(B) = 1

Take note, the form of the contradiction is irrrelevant. We could as well define zero as the cardinality of the negation of the excluded middle, but there is nevertheless an inherent property to any form we substitute into the :ref:`Fregean definition of zero <frege-zero>`: the expression will always involve an indeterminate x and a relation that cannot possibly result in a judgement of truth even in its indeterminacy, exemplified in :ref:`Frege <frege>`'s case as the inabilty of thing to not be itself. The foundation of Frege's arithmetic philosophy rests on the ontological equivalence of contradiction and nullity.

It must have been surprising to the first :ref:`being <being>` who recognized in language the image of the world. One is tempted to posit that exact moment as the historical origin of sentience. Akin to a photograph or a painting, a sentence is a reflection of :ref:`being <being>`; even when a painting depicts a fiction, it stil does so through the dimensions of necessity, through color and perspective, through representation; the same can be said of a sentence, for when we sketch the image of a paritcular :ref:`being <being>` in a proposition such as "*the pencil is over there*", we have, with words, captured the essential relationship embodied by an existent entity that is before us. We have "*photographed*" :ref:`being <being>` in words, reduced its momentary effervescence to a reproducible formulation.

Consider the etymological link between *passion* and *passive*. In the first reading, one might make the mistake of assuming a polarity between these terms, that is to say, a diametrical opposition. The former is a driving force whereas the latter is the lack of a driving force.

However, both emerge from a common Latin root of *passio*: to endure. That which is passive endures any state impressed upon it, while that which is passionate endures (perhaps unwillingly) the burden of seizure, of complete domination by an external source. In both cases, there is a commonality: the removal of the subject. The subject in a passive state is the same as a subject in a passionate state, which is null and void. In neither case is there a conscious decision to be made; instead one surrenders themselves to an unknown sovereignty; unknown because consciousness relinquishes its ability to care; sovereign because it is the determinate factor in the outcome that proceeds from said state.

Death as a subject is repellant to individual understanding. Its very definition presupposes the limit of the knower; That is to say, death is inherently unknowable. Death can only be understood through the mechanisms of analogy and metaphor, via the circuituous and torturous route of empty symbolism, for when we turn our attention directly to the object of death it reveals itself as something which is not to be found in our :ref:`world <world>`.

We can be aware that we will eventually die, we can perceive others passing from this world, we can even in unique circumstances perceive the manner of our own death, but none of this gets us any closer to the experience of death, none of this allows us to see what it is like to die. Our experience and awareness of experience will never be extended into death itself. We never see death for what it is, because it is :ref:`nothing <nothing>`, the absence of our :ref:`being <being>`. Death is the point where experience and awareness stops.

To ask questions about a subject that perpetually recedes from all attempts to know it necessarily entails the admission up front that no answers can ever be found. The inevitable end result will be to arrive where we started, back in the here and now, having gained nothing, except perhaps an understanding of what it means to be futile, which will anyway evaporate when we die; If any proposition can lay claim to human nature, this is it.

Death removes all possibility of absolute certainty.

To see this, we need only note that not only is it the case that it cannot be known whether after death [#november_2022_01]_ there is an afterlife, :ref:`nothing <nothing>`, an awareness without experience, or even a perpetual waking into another reality, these events cannot even be assigned probabilities in any real sense of the term. What would a probability outside the domain of immediate experience *mean*?

Uncertainty is a state of incompleteness, where knowledge cannot be attained because it is separated from :ref:`being <being>` by a layer of possibility. We do not know if the world outside of ourselves exists as it appears to us, for it is always a possibility that we are a brain in a vat, subject to the mind probes of a **Cartesian** demon.

A possibiilty is a type of a quantity that transmits uncertainty to reality by :ref:`being <being>` possible. In this sense, possibility and probability are synonyms. Just as all :ref:`probabilities <probability>` must sum to one, all possibilities must converge towards :ref:`being <being>`.

The isomorphism is nearly perfect: the distribution of an event's :ref:`probability <probability>` cannot be known without previous measurement so that before an event occurs any prior assumption about its nature can only be a completely random guess; Moreover, our knowledge of the distribution can only approach towards its true shape asymptotically as we accumulate a larger and larger sample, never actually transcending uncertainty (*cie la vie*, :ref:`Cantor <cantor>`...).

In the same way, a possibility can only be known after the fact. It is entirely impossible [#november_2022_02]_ to know whether a possibility is possible until it already happened. A possibility is characterized as something that could obtain, but to know whether it could obtain, one must know it has already been obtained. [#november_2022_03]_

Moreover, whatever :ref:`being <being>` may be, it is only what it is insofar that it is possible it might not be what it is, i.e. you might be reading these words in a dream.

What happens outside of our :ref:`being <being>` in the :ref:`world <world>` is not possible, because to be possible means, first and foremost, the possibility of coming to :ref:`be <being>` in the :ref:`world <world>`.

What then does the proposition "*it is possible there is an afterlife*" mean? How does something come to be outside of time and space? How does something come to be without being the consequence of something? One might as well say "*it is possible that possibility is impossible*".

Then, there are two types of uncertainty: An *ontological* uncertainty, which admits itself as a measure via quantization of possibility, for it is an uncertainty about :ref:`being <being>`, and a *metaphysical* uncertainty, which admits of no quantiziation because its actualities never :ref:`are <being>` never actually manifested in the :ref:`world <world>`, even through appearances, for it is an uncertainty about :ref:`appearance <phenomena>` and :ref:`existence <existence>` itself.

What is it in :ref:`being <being>` ourselves that prevents us from :ref:`being <being>` other people? Why does our :ref:`being <being>` require perspective and individuality?

---

Do mathematical theorems have truth outside of ourselves? To what extent is existence mathematical in the absence of our :ref:`being <being>` mathematical? Does our description of the appearance of reality ever penetrate to reality itself? What is reality outside of our description of it?

We are tempted to say here: reality and its description have a mapping, that the latter represents the former.

But the error of this is seen those intensely personal occurances which have no analogue in description. How does one describe anything subjective without resource to lyricism?

---

The :ref:`world <world>` inherently has an order, a structure that separates events through succession. Causality is manifest in time and space; things are a certain way, meaning the sequence of things that led to the current state of the world was just so and not some other way. Causality imposes a particular order on events, excluding the possibility of other orderings. Each event, by occuring, fixes the order of time as the particular circumstances that led to the current becoming of the :ref:`world`. It is a fact of symbolic logic that order relations must be anti-reflexive.

A reflexive relation is one that is the same forwards as backwards, i.e. :math:`x = y` is equivalent to :math:`y = x`.

An anti-reflexive relation can be seen in the relation of "*less than*", i.e. :math:`x < y` is not equivalent to :math:`y < x`. This asymmetry in the relation is what gives rises to its ordering. Because the relation cannot be reflected, the field of its values necessarily has an order, that is to say, each integer increases in magnitude, i.e. it is greater than its precedessor.

The ordering of time and space must necessarily make us ask, what is it about :ref:`being <being>` that is anti-reflexive? Where is the asymmetry in :ref:`being` to be found? Why are things always one way and not some other way? Why are things perceived in a linear fashion, that is to say, as a succession of form though time? What primitve rupture in reflection causes time to move forward, making thigns have an order?

---

    "I am this"

    "This is me"

When reflected, the "*am*" becomes an "*is*". Is this purely linguistic, an artifact of the peculiar evolution of the word ":ref:`being`"? Or is this the aforementioned rupture in the relation of :ref:`being <being>`? The English "*am*" is one-directional. It latches to its subject and severs its reflexivity. The  "*am*" reduces to "*is*" when the subject is object.

The "*is*" does not have this property.

    "This is a person."

    "A person is this.""

"*is*", in other words, is reflexive. There is no ordering in the existential relation of Being. It is, as mentioned, an equivalency relation.

---

The question, as always, is: is subjective :ref:`being <being>` the same as objective :ref:`being <being>`? And if it is, why does our linguistic representation of it bare the logical features of ordering? Why does our language allow the relation of "*am*" to operate in a non-reflexive way?

---

.. topic:: Conjecture

    *am* is the asymmetric *is*.

Or, in terms of ontological relations, existential :ref:`being <being>` is an equivalency relation. Subjective :ref:`being <being>` is an ordering relation.

Everything is language.

Everything signifies something it is not.

As I get older, the thoughts are harder to string together. More and more, it is a morass of half-understood images, glimpsed with uncertain comprehension. It feels like my mind is falling apart.

I want to say something definite: that what we are is symbolic. Our nature consists of naming and relating. There is no greater power in this world than to invoke a thing's name, to draw it into the foreground of attention and present that which is named as a singular thing, separate and isolated from the world in which it arose.

They tell me I am made of particles, incomprehensibly tiny things that are concentrated into mathematical points, but then I am told this is not quite right, because points have positions and no one has ever been able to say where exactly a particle is.

Science has a hole in its foundation. Or more precisely: an impassable bedrock that prevents the inductive advance of human knowledge beyond a prescribed depth, the limit of abstraction. Predicated on measurement, science immediately deteriorates when the truth upon which it rests is sought.

The idea that things can be measured relies on the idea that a property of a thing can be abstracted away from the thing's being. A thing is not a unit, but it is equal, in some way, to the units which comprise its measurement. Equality, as a concept, only obtains when a thing is abstracted of its qualities and reduced to a quantitative description.

To understand everything as measureable is to understand everything as a quantity. The act of measurement is equivalent to comparison of quantities. A thing is named to be the unit. To measure a thing is to relate it to this designation. To say a thing has two units is to say it has two units *of* the designated unit.

Humans have somehow inverted the direction of dependence in the relation of measurement to reality. We live with an unconscious assumption, at least in aggregate within the context of the modern world, one that happens to be false: that measurement is equivalent to substantial existence. We have abstracted from measurement a definite mathematical structure the world must abide. However, this abstraction was preceded in its application by initialization of the unit. The abstraction is dependent on the designations. And so we fail to comprehend the fundamental uncertainty from which being is born.

Measurement can only exist in relation to the units which have been demarcated and designated as things which measure. Measurability cannot be the basis for being, because it must be predicated on a reference to another being, namely the unit, which only exists as a designation within an interpretation. In other words, the entire edifice of science presupposes a subject is *in the world*, engaged in the act of interpretation.

---

There are no answers. More fundamentally, there does not even exist the possibility of an answer.

---

The problem is :ref:`truth <truth>`. It's impossible to define. More precisely: it's definition undoes its foundation. If you say: something is true if it is the case (i.e. agrees with reality), then by allowing the indeterminate sentence to be named, even with a name so innocuous as "something", you've allowed the necessary and sufficient conditions for a contradiction to emerge. Let the next sentence be called P. The sentence P is not true. Then, by our definition of truth, we see we have named an undecidable sentence.  More than that, we have annihilated the possibility of truth by demonstrating an example of something to which it cannot apply, that is, something neither true or false. Self reference is a paradox that cannot be exorcised; it's impossible to give a name to something without that name referencing the thing to be named. You cannot talk about truth without giving things names and you cannot name a thing without decimating the foundations of language. We arise from a vacuum of meaning, and blindly seek what cannot be sought. All that we know and think is built on top of a void.

Long moments where nothing happens. Half-formed sentences grasping at incoherent thoughts.

Did the universe feel the vice grip of anxiety, were its innards churned in vexing anticipation, as it awaited us? Did the universe agonize over every solemn moment, measure every millisecond with precise stop watches, while those who might bear witness gestated in possibility?

Did it idle in indifference? Did eternities tick by unnoticed? Was there nothing that might slow the passing of time, no passing glance of introspection, no fractal blossoming out of an instant, no reason to stop and watch in awe?

Was there time at all?

How strange, to find yourself in a moment, with only trails of breadcrumbs fading in the horizon to tell you what came before. To traverse any of these passages only extends them indefinitely, adding more long seconds, more breadcrumbs trailing backwards from your position.

How strange, to only be able to think in terms of time. Never able to ask what came *before* time.

The question invokes absurdity. Of course, you are a product of your parents, and them of their grandparents, and so on, one long chain extending back to some point in the past where it either breaks or begins. Is there always someone prior, some ancestor from which we derive our heritage, at every link in the chain? Is everything preceded by cause?

Is time infinite? Or finite? Does it exist outside of our perception? Is it merely a *form* of perception? Something revealed through the act of perception? If so, then what exists in the absence of perception? Is :being-without-us static and eternal, timeless and formless? Does it *exist* all?

At what point, in tracing our anthropological origins, do we encounter the point where being becomes being-without-us? Presumably there must have been a point in time when there were no conscious entities and in the next moment, there were. How far back does the chain go? Is it possible to conceive of being-without-space? Being-without-time?

Is it possible to conceive of this moment? Are we incapable of understanding what the world is if we subtracted from it?

Is the ladder of causality we extend indefinitely into the past flawed in some way? Does it measure reality? Is it an artifice?

Things only have causes insofar we perceive in them in a complex. We say *A* causes *B* because we perceive a temporal relation between *A* and *B*, a dependency that requires one precede the other. The causal link is only :ref:`true <truth>` insofar that we may use it to predict the occurrence of *B* given *A*.

This is, at any rate, what we mean in a scientific sense. :ref:`Truth <truth>` in this respect is a property of judgement, it is an emanation of judgement. But this definition of truth does not allow us to take its content and make them absolute. It is always relative to the perception that perceives the relation between *A* and *B*.

This definition of :ref:`truth <truth>` does not allow us to take the observations and derive from them absolute truth. We are always relegated to saying "*assuming this is the case*". But we are never able to remove all assumptions from any proposition. Always there are priors that precede everything.

We cannot say with certainty *what there is outside of ourselves*. We cannot get to that hypothetical moment in time of *being-without-us* through pure understanding. We cannot even say we know there *is* a *being-without-us*.

We never know from where, precisely, a feeling emanates. A feeling is not something that can be encountered in tangible form, but is rather encountered *through* form. This had led us to suppose all *feelings* are representative of the same category of "*thing*"

We are misled by the primacy and immediacy of experience in this matter. When we feel pain, for instance, we feel it *in* a location; indeed, in the modern world, we now know of the nervous system and the way external stimuli excite impulses along its circuits, leading us to suppose the stimuli is more than the *cause* of the pain, but in some way, *is* the pain. We burn our hand and say the pain is *there*, *in* my hand.

Yet, we feel in another respect, in a way that reveals the mutually excluded origins of disjoint phenomenon we refer to as "*feelings*". We say we feel when something gives us joy or causes us despair, i.e. "*I enjoy the music of Chopin*"" or "*Her death caused me great pain*". However, when we seek the origin of these propositions in material reality, we immediately collide with the impenetrability of their explanations: because we love, because we care. There is no finer increment to resolve down into; there is no map from these *things* to the encounterable world-substance, to observable reality. There is no nervous system for the propagation of love; love does not act on a point; love does not impinge on the senses through mechanisms of causality. Love is the possession of our :ref:`being <being>`; it is only understood by :ref:`being <being>`, through :ref:`being <being>`; it is a way of becoming, irreducible to the :ref:`beings <being>` which in the process become.

The fallacy arises when suppose *pain* and *love* are different "*grades*" of phenomenal experience. We assume *feeling* is a spectrum and that all the things we *feel* must necessarily have something in common. In reality, every *feeling* moves within its own dimensions.

The first act of a fool is not the presumption preceding a judgement, but the certainty that follows it.

Certainty is a curious thing.

The things of which we are most certain, e.g. the feelings and sensations that comprise our phenomenal experience, are not properties of the external world. The certainty of our desire and intentions is due to their origination from within the deepest chambers of our selves, in the privative isolation of our consciousness. We are certain of what we feel, because what we are is, entirely and exactly, what we feel.

The things of which we are least certain, e.g. the true reality of the external world, are quantifiable properties, things which can be counted and grouped into definite amounts. There is no procedure outside of perception and judgement by which external things may enter into the internal constitution of a consciousness. Things of the external world must be represented in the perception, which in turn requires the image of the thing projected onto the sense organ must be detached from the thing itself. The sensuous thing which is perceived is only an indication of the actual thing, i.e. a representation.

Certainty, then, is only absolute in the subjective sense.

Ultimately, we are alone. We are separate from the world, and that means we are separate from one another.

We all have a hole in our hearts. That hole is exactly equal in shape and size to the world. That hole is our reflected outline, all the things which we are not and can never be.

All we seek is this: to not be separate, to love and be loved so much the distinction loses meaning. We seek the dissolution of alienation, which is to say, we seek the annihiliation of self.

For self is fundamentallty an alienation, an alienation of the :ref:`world <world>` from itself. What we are is separateness, in pure and unadulterated form. We are always *beside* ourselves, never *in* ourselves.

What we are *essentially* is the :ref:`world <world>`, for it is through us worldhood is attained. But it is attained in such a way that its attainment severs us from the totality thus attained.

What we are *fundamentally* is a lacking. We lack a connection to the :ref:`world <world>` that is brought into :ref:`being <being>` by our inhabiting of it, the :ref:`world <world>` that is severed from us as it becomes from us. We are relegated to our bodies, these containers of separateness. The :ref:`world <world>` we create is forever and always outside of ourselves.

    ":ref:`Being <being>`" is said in many ways.

    -- `Metaphysics`_, Aristotle

It is first of all said, and "*to be said*" requires what is said to be expressible in :ref:`language <language>`. Every linguistic form is a representation. Therefore, something said is necessarily representative of some other thing. What a representation is and what it is representative of is left vague in the beginning, but the form of representation is not: :ref:`language <language>`.

In order to understand the initial statement, one then turns to an analysis of :ref:`language <language>` in order to clarify what could possibly be meant by a thing which can be said. A description of :ref:`language <language>` is a necesary component of any exposition that wants to analyze the ways in which "*being*" is said. In making this description, one immediately encounters the essential problem in ontological endeavors: describing the operation of "*description*"" is itself a description.

Every system of thought, by objectifying the world, makes an object of itself within that system. "*System*" in this sense is synonymous with and equivalent to "*:ref:`language <language>`*".

For instance, lingustic representations possess the property of standing for things they themselves are not.

.. note::

    Let "*R*" stand for things that are red.

    Let "*B*" stand for things that are blue.

Here a letter, "*R*" or "*B*" , stands in place of something else. These letters are *representations*. Note the letter "*R*"" is not a thing that is red, except in circumstances where it is printed in red ink. Rather, it symbolizes the conjunction in thought of elements that possess the attribute of "*being red*". The letter "*R*" makes an abstraction of the elements we agree belong to it.

---

On the other hand, there are sometimes classes of words that stand for themselves, or at least include themselves in that for which they stand. For example, the word "*word*" is a word that stands for the thing which it is,

    "*Word*" is a word.

However, a crucial distinction must be drawn in these cases. The quotation marks in the preceding example are not frivolities. They are a necessary component of the proposition, for they provide a boundary that outlines a thing's *name*. Sans quotation marks, the proposition descends into senselessness,

    Word is a word.

This analysis hinges on the realization first proffered by :ref:`Tarski <tarski>` that there is a consequential difference between the :ref:`language <language>` in which we speak propositions of a :ref:`language <language>` and the :ref:`language <language>` in which we speak *about* the propositions of a :ref:`language <language>`.

    The :ref:`language <language>` one speaks is not necessarily the :ref:`language <language>` about which one speaks.

Confusion often results when the same :ref:`language <language>` performs both functions. In the case of mathematics, where the proposition :ref:`language <language>` is that of, say, arithmetic, and the description :ref:`language <language>` that of logic, the distinction is easier to maintain. When doing philosophy, the different levels of speech often waver and blur together, leading to confusion. For the purposes of clarity, quotation marks serve the function of referring to the name of the concept addressed whereas a unquoted word expresses what is meant by the concept. This lack of clarity throughout history is one of the root causes of Martin Heidegger's deconstruction of " :ref:`Being <being>` " in the early twentieth century.

If the goal is to define ":ref:`being <being>`", then one can only succeed at the level of description. A description *about* a " :ref:`Being <being>` " is incapable of saying what is meant by " :ref:`being <being>` ".

When one authentically speaks the phrase "*I know this*", one understands this to be meant in the context of certainy. "*Knowledge*", if the term is to mean anything at all, must be defined in terms of certainty. "*It is known*" must be replaceable in all instances with "*it is certain*"

The question of what is certain has no obvious or immediate answer, and so the existence of pure knowledge, of a kind that is absolute and without condition, is called into question. The world and all of its contents seem so hopelessly dependent on the subjective experience that one cannot truly convince one's self that it exists in the absence of the subject.

The world presents itself, but the basis for the knowledge of this presentation is its representation to the self.

Everything imaginable is contained in, or possibly equal to, the enumeration of all possible representations. What cannot be imagined is precisely that which cannot be represented to the self. If a possibility exists that cannot be imagined, then it is only because "*self*" does not entail the totality of possibility. This can only occur if the representations presented to the self are incomplete, that is, if the presentation lacks content that cannot be comprehended through its representative form.

---

.. epigraph::

    If you do know that "*here is one hand*", we'll grant you all the rest.

    -- `On Certainty`_, Wittgenstein

If the objective is to produce a certain fact, then all assumptions must be removed and one must start from nothing. Only the production of a fact from nullity would be able to satisfy any reasonable definition of "*certainty*". If a fact derives from a prior assumption, then the fact is only as certain as its constitutive assumptions. Therefore, the question of the validity of the concept of "*certainy*" reduces to the question of whether positive knowledge can be derived from nothing.

It is a maxim of post-Kantian philosophy that what is known must be known through the experience of "*knowing*", and thus it must be conditioned by experience. Knowledge of a thing is knowledge of the sensuous experience of the thing and what the sensuous cannot present to experience cannot be known.

For any object of experience, its attributes may be abstracted away in thought, but even an indeterminate object must possess a condition of determination for being able to be an object of experience; it is this form of determination that Kant identifies as " :ref:`a priori <a-priori>` ". If, from a thing, its manifest qualities are subtracted, one is left with the pure abstract relation that sensuous experience deploys in order to perform the ontological operation of objectification.

The operands of the objectification are the experience for which the object is the object thus identified by experience. This operation yields a unique index, which one is inclined to call an object's "*name*". In other words, receptivity to naming is a prerequisite for being knowable. A thing cannot be known unless it can be named.

The inverse does not follow. One cannot conclude from "*if a thing cannot be named, then it cannot be known*" that "*if a thing cannot be known, then a thing cannot be named*". If the latter were the case, then one would lack a proper name for " :ref:`nothing <nothing>` ".

    What is not truly one :ref:`being <being>` is not truly *one* :ref:`being <being>` either.

    -- `Leibniz Letters`_, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz

To say the same thing in a different way,

    To be a *being* is to be *a* being.

Apparently tautological in form, the exact meaning of the Liebniz's proposition can only be understood through the emphasis placed on its constituent words, which in turn immediately enriches its otherwise vacuous content. In this way, the words in Leibniz's proposition have semantic content that is not contained in their letters, if by "*letters*" it is meant "*characters of the alphabet*". This is obvious in :ref:`languages <language>` with aspirated breathing marks, where the operation of emphasis possesses a symbol within the :ref:`language <language>`, but English can be deceptive in this regard, for italicization or boldening are not normally considered a linguistic symbol, even though they possess no warrant to belong to any other classification.

Leibniz's emphasis is a form of naming that would more naturally be represented with quotation marks. The lefthand side of the proposition selects the name of :ref:`being <being>`, ":ref:`being <being>`", preparing it for the operation of definition. The selection is then equated through the copula of being to the righthand side, which defines the named :ref:`being <being>` as the being of the name of the article through which it is selected for naming. A ":ref:`being <being>`" is nothing more than an index attached to a :ref:`being <being>`.

The operation of naming can be understood in terms of pure direction. A rule is given that picks a name from the domain of names and assigns to it an object in the domain of objects. In the preceding sentence, "*object*" is not necessarily equivalent to "*thing*", and might be more precisely described as "*an indeterminate* :ref:`being <being>`".

Consider the infinite sequence of squares,

In what sense is this sequence (*set*, *class*, *abstraction*) equivalent to the following function?

.. math::

    f(n) = n ^ 2

"*f*" is a formal statement, devoid of content. It must be interpretted to have any meaning. This equivalence can only be maintained if the function "*f*" is understood to be assigning a name from the domain of natural numbers to each element in the domain of squares. "*f*" names each element in the sequence of squares by indexing them. In other words, "*0*"" is the name of first square, "*1*"" is the name of the second square, "*4*"" is the name of the third square, et cetera.

Frege was the first to recognize the mathematical function as possessing the formal structure of a "*name*".

The desire for exegesis cannot be met without recourse to personal experience, and in introducing the subjective element, the exegesis itself is undone. One wants a formal deduction, a series of arguments absolute and pure, proceeding from a starting point whose self-evidence is immanent. One wants to find the words to lay upon this thing called life like a map, to show what it is and how it is to be understood. We seek a science that explains what it is to be, that will, as part of its apparatus, integrate our very consciousness into its fabric and render unto us a divine sort of revelation.

This is the essential human delusion. Essential, because it resides in every activity; there is nothing which is that does not presuppose the law of cause and effect, and so we come to be supposing all which is must abide this fundamental law. Human, because it is our :ref:`poetical <syntagmics>` curse to attach symbols to objects. Delusion, because the subject will never find itself among objects, except as an object.

We imagine the written word like a mirror, a silvered surface that reflects and reveals its point of origin through precise geometry but our thoughts are not like rays of light, and the page is no surface to preserve in perfect fashion the objects incident upon it. The word always grasps towards what it wants to represent, but fails in its approach.

Is there a series of words that explains the world's churning? Mathematicians tells us to fix our definitions, and let logic unfold. With what definition do we start? *To be*, seems the most general of relations, the most primitive of terms. Thus, we initiate again an Aristotelian chain, whose history is available to any student of philsophy. Such an exercise, though worthwhile, will only yield formal results, against which we will inevitably rebel in Heideggerian fashion, and then succumb, forgetting in essence our original task.

I want to tell you what I know, but the words that I would use to give form to my thoughts escape me. I labor in vain for quiet hours. There is structure in our experience, in our lives, underneath its surface, if only it were presented, so that it might be represented in symbolic form.

It is easy to slip into solipsism, like a Cartesian fingertrap. One must remember that :ref:`language <language>` presumes the presence of another. Though the world as we know it may lack facts, it never lacks form. The existence of words is testament to the communal aspect of reality, that when we are in the :ref:`world <world>`, we are in the :ref:`world <world>` with someone else. The :ref:`world <world>`, a veil though it may be in its appearance, is substantial, because it can be described, and a decription can only exist *for* someone.

Let us start any exegesis with this simple proposition whose tautological nature is thus self evident:

    What is said requires some one to say it.

Let us use this a ballast when the ontological investigations we undertake lead us astray, into a nihilistic miasma.

.. _carnaps-method:

Carnap's Method of Tautology
----------------------------

A common problem in formal logic is determining whether a given proposition is a tautology, i.e. true in all possible cases. Since the number of rows in a truth table grows exponentially with the number of propositions, the traditional method of truth tables is computationally expensive. In `Introduction to Symbolic Logic and Its Applications`_, Carnap presents a different method for evaluating whether or not a given proposition is a tautology. Rather than enumerating all possible cases and checking if each one is true, it suffices to show the assignment of false to a proposition is impossible. In other words, Carnap's method starts by assuming the proposition is false and then works backwards through the logical connectives to see whether or not an assignment of false is consistent with the proposition.

For example, consider the well-known property of implications,

.. math::

    ((p \implies r) \land (q \implies r)) \implies ((p \land q) \implies r)

To determine whether this constitues a tautology, it must be shown whether or not an assignment of false can be made to the entire proposition. The proposition is built out of nested propositions. The assignment of false to entire proposition will in turn require the subformulas of the proposition to assume particular values. This will yield conditions for evaluating whether the overall assignment is consistent with the assignment of its components. The top-level connective is,

.. math::

    s \implies t 

Where :math:`s = (p \implies r) \land (q \implies r)` and :math:`t = ((p \land q) \implies r)`.

In order for this implication to be false, the hypothesis, :math:`s`, must be true, while the consequence, :math:`t`, must be false.

The assignment of false to :math:`t` in turn requires :math:`p \land q` to be true and :math:`r` to be false.

The assignment of true to :math:`p \land q` in turn requires :math:`p` be true and :math:`q` be true.

Thus, it is seen in order for the proposition itself to be false, :math:`p` and :math:`q` must be true, while :math:`r` is false.

These values, however, are inconsistent with the hypothesis, :math:`s`, which was required to be true, for :math:`p \implies r` and :math:`q \implies r` are both false under this assignment, and thus their conjunction is false. This contradicts our initial assumption that :math:`s` is true. Therefore, the entire proposition cannot be false for any assignment and it must be concluded the entire proposition is true for all possible values of :math:`p`, :math:`q` and :math:`r`.

The Context Problem
-------------------

As a thought experiment, suppose you encountered a string in an unknown :ref:`language <language>`,

.. math::

    a = b = c

Without any further information about the :ref:`language <language>`, nearly any interpretation can be assigned to this expression. There is a small amount of information encoded in the repetition of "=", which imposes a light constraint on the possible interpretations, but the meaning of these interpretations is still too diverse to say with any measure of certainty what this expression could possibly mean. "=" could, for example, serve the dual role of a *relativizer* and an *indicator*, allowing such interpretations as,

    lady that sings that tune

In this interpretation, "a" is assigned the meaning of "(the) lady", "b" that of "sings" and "c" that of "tune". Obviously, a large number, possibly infinite in size, of such expressions can be constructed.

Suppose you are provided a dictionary of *primitive* symbols. This dictionary fixes the meaning of the "=" to the familiar concept of "equality". However, even this disambiguating assignment stills the leave door open to a myriad of interpretations. This assignment imposes only the lightest of constraints on the other word-forms in the expression. For example, it is unclear if the expression with the "equality" assignment should be interpretted as meaning,

    "a = b" and "b = c"

Or

    a = (b = c)

Or

    (a = b) = c

In the first interpretation, "a", "b" and "c" must represent terms within the :ref:`language <language>`. In the second interpretation, "a" fills the meta-role of a truth value while "b" and "c" fill the roles of terms in the object :ref:`language <language>`. In the third interpretation, "a" and "b" fill the roles of object terms while "c" fills the role of a :ref:`truth <truth>` value.

In other words, the assignment of the meaning of "=" imposes certain constraints on the values the other word-forms in the expression may range over, but ambiguity still remains. Indeed, it may argued a quanta of ambiguity is always present in any interpretation assigned to a string of symbols.

The essential *context* problem boils down to: what word-form in an expression should be treated as primitive in order to be used as a foundation upon which to build the subsequent interpretation.

The Curse of the Rebellious Set
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. topic:: Definition: The Rebellious Set

    Let :math:`A` be any set and let :math:`P(A)` be it's power set. Assume :math:`f: A \to P(A)`. The Rebellious Set, denoted R, is defined as the set which satisfies this formula,

    .. math::

        R = \{ x \in A \, \mid \, x \notin f(x) \}

**Theorem** :math:`f: A \to P(A) \leftrightarrow \lvert R \rvert \geq 1`

Let :math:`P(A)` be the power set of :math:`A` (the set of all subsets of :math:`A`). Suppose there exists a bijection :math:`f: A -> P(A)`. This means every element in :math:`A` is paired with a unique subset of :math:`A`, and vice versa.

If :math:`A = \emptyset`, then its power set :math:`P(A)` contains one element, the empty set itself, :math:`P(A) = {∅}`. In this case, there's no bijection between :math:`A` and :math:`P(A)`, and the theorem holds trivially.

If :math:`A \neq \emptyset`, it must contain at least one element. Let *a* be this element. Consider the subset of :math:`A`` that contains only this element, :math:`\{a\}`. Since *f* is assumed to be a bijection, there must be some element :math:`y \in A` such that :math:`f(y) = \{a\}`.

If :math:`y = a`, then, :math:`a \in f(a)`, which contradicts the definition of :math:`B` (that is, the elements in :math:`B` are not in the set they are mapped to).

If :math:`y \neq a`, then :math:`y \notin f(y)`, which means *y* should be in :math:`B` according to its definition. Since *y* exists, :math:`B` is not empty. ∎

.. _part-whole-theorem:

**Theorem** :math:`\forall A: \lvert P(A) \rvert > \lvert A \rvert`

For the sake of contradiction, suppose there exists a bijection (a one-to-one correspondence)  :math:`f: A \to P(A)`. This means every element in :math:`A` is paired with a unique subset of :math:`A`, and vice versa.

Consider the rebellious set,

.. math::

    R = \{ x \in A \, \mid \, x \notin f(x) \}

This set :math:`R` contains all elements of :math:`A` that are not members of the subset they are mapped to by *f*. By the previous theorem, this set is non-empty. Since *f* is a bijection, there must be an element :math:`r \in A` such that :math:`f(r) = R`.

If :math:`r \in R`, then by the definition of :math:`R`, :math:`r ∉ f(r)`. But :math:`f(r) = R`, so :math:`r \notin R`, a contradiction.

If :math:`r \notin R`, then by the definition of :math:`R`, :math:`r ∈ f(r)`. But :math:`f(r) = R`, so :math:`r \in R`, again a contradiction.

The initial assumption that there exists a bijection between :math:`A` and :math:`P(A)` must be false.

Therefore,

There are two mutually exclusive categories of :ref:`palindromes <definition-4-1-1>` in any :ref:`language <language>`: perfect and imperfect.

A :ref:`perfect palindrome <definition-4-1-2>` is symmetric, by which it is meant a :ref:`perfect palindrome <definition-4-1-2>` may be reversed character-wise. Of the "species" of :ref:`palindromes <definition-4-1-1>` in any given :ref:`language <language>`, they are the most rare, because their grammatical conditions are so stringent (at least as far as English is concerned). Counter-intuitively, this makes them the easiest to construct.

:ref:`Perfect palindromes <definition-4-1-2>` mostly hinge on :ref:`invertible <invertible-words>` grammatical structures embodied in the "*on-no*", "*now-won*" and "*saw-was*" invertible pairs. Without these invertible pivot points, a :ref:`perfect palindromes <definition-4-1-2>` must rely on the symmetry of a central :ref:`palindromic word <reflective-words>`. In other words, the cardinality of :ref:`perfect palindromes <definition-4-1-2>` is related to the cardinality of :ref:`invertible words <invertible-words>` and the cardinality of purely :ref:`reflective words <reflective-words>`.

- repel on no leper
- dog saw raw war was god
- gateman now won nametag
- snoops now won spoons
- pupils did slipup
- strips deified spirts

:ref:`Imperfect palindromes <definition-4-1-3>`, by contrast, degrade under reversal. Consider cases like "*borrow or rob*" or "*name now one man*" which, while palindromic, do not preserve semantic content when reversed. However, by dropping the delimiting character, namely the space " ", the palindromicity can be reconstructed in a degenerate alphabet, e.g. "*borroworob*" and "*namenowoneman*" are palindromic strings in an alphabet with no delimiting characters.

These observations suggest an algebraic structure exists embedded within linguistics. Let :math:`\zeta` be a sentence, defined as a sequence of characters. Then, define the :ref:`inverse <string-inversion>` of a sentence, :math:`\text{inv}(\zeta)`, as the reversal of :math:`\zeta`'s characters. Furthermore, define the :ref:`reduction <definition-3-1-2>` of a sentence, :math:`\varsigma(\zeta)`, as the string which results from the removal of delimiter characters from :math:`\zeta`. Then, palindromes, :math:`\zeta_p` can be defined mathematically as the sentences whose reduced forms are equal to their own inverses,

.. math::

    \varsigma(\zeta_p) = \text{inv}(\varsigma(\zeta_p))

It can be shown that inversion and reduction, which are string operations, commute over strings, so the above equation can be extended,

.. math::

    \varsigma(\zeta_p) = \varsigma(\text{inv}(\zeta_p)) = \text{inv}(\varsigma(\zeta_p))

In other words, palindromes, perfect and imperfect, are exactly the class of sentences which satsify this formal constraint.

In contrast, a :ref:`Hysteron Proteron <hysteron-proteron>` is a form of word play that requires more than just symbol shunting. Its essence involves the interpretation of its component parts which simultaneously places them into a contradictory whole.

Logical Primitives
------------------

In one of his earlier papers published in 1923, *On the Primitive Term of Logistic*, Tarksi proved all logical operations in second-order logic could be defined in terms of :ref:`quantification <logical-quantification>` (i.e. categorical assertions) and :ref:`equivalence <logical-equivalence>` (i.e. substitutability).

In doing so, Tarksi introduced a ":ref:`truth <truth>`" predicate into the meta-language of analysis. This notion of ":ref:`truth <truth>`" differs considerably from the natural conception of :ref:`truth <truth>`, for it treats :ref:`truth <truth>` as an equivalency with syntactically tautologous expressions. It becomes clear, as his definitions are made and theorems derived, that this meta-logical definition of ":ref:`truth <truth>`" is insufficient for fully elaborating the synthetic and empirical modes of :ref:`truth <truth>`.

.. topic:: Definition: Truth

    "*p is true*" is equivalent to "*p*"" being equivalent to "*p*".

    .. math::

        \forall p: tr(p) \equiv (p \equiv p)

.. topic:: Definition: Assertion

    "*p is asserted*" is equivalent to "*p*"

    .. math::

        \forall p: as(p) \equiv p

.. topic:: Definition: Falsity

    "*p is false*" is equivalent to "*p*" being equivalent to "*not p*"

    .. math::

        \forall p: fl(p) \equiv (p \equiv \neg p)

The predicates ":ref:`truth <truth>`", "*falsity*" and "*assertion*" should be understood operationally as predicates which satisfy these extensional definitions, and not as representatives of their colloquial interpretations.

The use of the indeterminate predicate :math:`f(p)` in these definitions implicitly allows second-order constructs into the discourse. :math:`f(p)`, for any *f*, is equivalent to asserting there exists an :math:`F` such that :math:`p \in F`, where :math:`F` is the *set* of :math:`p`'s that have the property *f*. Predication is a sneaky way of inserting ":ref:`sets <sets>`"  (or "*classes*") into a language without explicitly introducing the predicates :math:`\in` and :math:`\subset`. Refer to :ref:`Frege's Law V <frege-axioms>` for the ultimate consequences of abstraction.

Tarski begins the paper with a reference to a previously established result that shows logical :ref:`negation <logical-negation>` can be defined using only :ref:`quantification <logical-quantification>` and :ref:`equivalence <logical-equivalence>`,

.. math::

    \forall p: (\neg p) \equiv (p \equiv (\forall q: q))

Tarski uses this theorem as a starting point to show that :ref:`equivalence <logical-equivalence>` and :ref:`quantification <logical-quantification>` constitute the sole primitive terms of propositional calculus.

However, there is an interesting *implicit* assumption being made by asserting this theorem. The validity of this theorem rests on the contradiction of the inner expression :math:`\forall q: q`. In other words, in order for this theorem to obtain, it must be the case that :math:`\forall q: q` is always false. :math:`\neg \forall q: q` is indeed true, but not unconditionally, and the conditions in which it is not true are worth considering. The essence of this distinction is given in the insight the truth being expressed in the proposition :math:`\neg \forall q: q` is of a different order than a truth that is expressed :ref:`tautologically <tautologies>`, e.g. by a pure :ref:`equivalence <logical-equivalence>` such as :math:`\neg(p \lor q) \equiv (\neg p \land \neg q)`.

:ref:`Tautological <tautologies>` :ref:`truth <truth>` are vacuous; they reveal nothing about the state of the world. A proposition such as :math:`p \lor \neg p` is a *formal* :ref:`truth <truth>` that depends only on the syntax of logic. It's :ref:`truth <truth>` is not a function of the :ref:`language <language>` in which it is expressed; While the symbols :math:`\lor` and :math:`\neg` may be assigned different meanings, the resulting :ref:`language <language>` will still retain an expression which expresses the fundamental logical :ref:`truth <truth>` given by the law of excluded middle, however cumbersome and unintuitive its symbolic representation in this hypothetical :ref:`language <language>` may be.

In contrast, :math:`\neg \forall q: q` is not *necessarily* :ref:`true <truth>` in any :ref:`language <language>`, where ":ref:`language <language>`" is to be understood as the set of all :ref:`propositions <proposition>` *q*. It is conceivable to imagine a :ref:`language <language>` that only allows the expression of true statements, in which case, since all :math:`q` are :ref:`true <truth>`, :math:`\neg \forall q: q`, a *meta*-:ref:`proposition <proposition>` *about* the :ref:`language <language>`, becomes false.

In addition, it is conceivable to imagine a :ref:`language <language>` that expresses notions other than :ref:`truth values <truth-values>`, in which case *q* cannot be treated as an assertion of :ref:`truth <truth>` and the *meta*-:ref:`proposition <proposition>` :math:`\neg \forall q: q` becomes meaningless.

If :math:`\neg \forall q: q` is to be :ref:`true <truth>`, it must be the case that :ref:`language <language>` given by the set of *q* is capable of expressing false statements. In other words, :math:`\neg \forall q: q` is a :ref:`proposition <proposition>` about the semantic content of :math:`\{ q | \forall q: q \}`, in particular, it is asserting a partition of the :ref:`language <language>` into those statements which are true and those statements which are false exists, and furthermore, the partition of false :ref:`propositions <proposition>` is non-empty.

.. math::

    (\neg \forall q: q) \equiv (\exists q: \neg q)

In other words, at least one false :ref:`proposition <proposition>` exists. While this is a pragmatic and practical assumption as far as any non-trivial :ref:`language <language>` is concerned, it is nevertheless not a "*free*" assumption, in the sense that is automatically granted if the laws of :ref:`tautology <tautologies>` are also granted. The proposition :math:`\neg \forall q: q` cannot be unconditionally true, and so its truth depends on the particular :ref:`language <language>` that is under inspection. In other words, :math:`\neg \forall q: q` is implicitly a :ref:`proposition <proposition>` *about* :ref:`propositions <proposition>`, namely that not all of them can be :ref:`true <truth>`.

If this assumption is granted, the other logical operations can be reduced to the operations of quantification and equivalence as follows: It is well-known :ref:`disjunction <logical-disjunction>` can be defined in terms in of :ref:`implication <logical-implication>`.

.. math::

    \forall p, q: (p \lor q) \equiv (\neg p \implies q)

Moreover, it is well-known that logical implication can be defined in terms of equivalence and conjunction,

.. math::

    \forall p, q: (p \implies q) \equiv (p \equiv (p \land q))

Therefore, if :ref:`conjunction <logical-conjunction>` can be defined in terms of equivalence and quantification, it can be asserted all of second-order logic is contained in the operations of :ref:`equivalence <logical-equivalence>` and :ref:`quantification <logical-quantification>`, since all other operations can be syllogistically defined in terms of these two primitives. With this goal in mind, Tarksi builds up in sequence the following theorems.

**Theorem** :math:`\forall p: tr(p)`

All propositions are equivalent to themselves. Every proposition is either true or false, whence the following :ref:`truth table <truth-tables>` obtains,

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1

  * - :math:`p`
    - :math:`p \equiv p`
  * - T
    - T
  * - F
    - T

**Theorem** :math:`\forall p: (\forall q: p \equiv tr(q)) \implies p`

All propositions that are always :ref:`true <truth>` implies themselves.

For each proposition *q* in the hypothesis, the following :ref:`truth table <truth-tables>` describes the possible outcomes,

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1

  * - :math:`p`
    - :math:`q`
    - :math:`q \equiv q`
    - :math:`p \equiv (q \equiv q)`
  * - T
    - T
    - T
    - T
  * - T

    - T
  * - F
    - T
    - T
    - F
  * - F
    - F
    - T
    - F

Since the hypothesis is always false exactly when :math:`p` is false, the theorem follows from the definition of implication.

**Theorem** :math:`\forall p, q: p \implies (p \equiv tr(q))`

All propositions imply they are equivalent to always :ref:`being <being>` :ref:`true <truth>`. The :ref:`truth table <truth-tables>` from the previous theorem can be used to verify this theorem for every possible proposition :math:`p` and :math:`q`.

Here is where the collapse of all :ref:`true <truth>` expressions into an equivalence class occurs. :ref:`Truth <truth>` is what aggregates the descriptive operators of language into a whole. It is what unites the propositions "2 + 2 = 4" and "Snow is white" into an equivalence. :ref:`Truth <truth>`, in effect, abstracts away the descriptive predicatives of a language, at least insofar as this formulation is concerned.

**Theorem** :math:`\forall p: (\forall q: p \equiv tr(q)) \equiv p`

All propositions are equivalent to being equivalent to always being :ref:`true <truth>`. Once again, this can be demonstrated with the previous :ref:`truth table <truth-tables>`.

Any :ref:`true <truth>` proposition is equivalent to any other :ref:`true <truth>` proposition because they are all equivalent to tautologies. Only in this desolate landscape of pure vacuity can :ref:`truth <truth>` be defined. A tautology expresses through form what is self-evident.

:ref:`Truth <truth>`, however, is not a mere consequence of self-evidence. It is not wholly :ref:`a priori <a-priori>`; it is constructed out of parts tautologous and parts empirical, in short it is :ref:`synthetic <synthesis>`. This realization is what led to Tarski to the insights which fueled `The Concept of Truth in Formalized Languages`_ in 1931.

**Theorem** :math:`\forall p,q: (\forall f: p \equiv (\forall r: p \equiv f(r)) \equiv (\forall r: q \equiv f(r))) \implies q`

The formulae :math:`\forall r: p \equiv f(r)` and :math:`\forall r: q \equiv f(r)` serve as the main content of this theorem. Therefore, to understand the theorem, these formulae must be understood. Tarski refers to the terms :math:`f(r)` as a :ref:`truth <truth>` functions. He references the work of Russell and Whitehead in elaborating the conditions that must be met to refer to a function as a :ref:`truth <truth>` function, namely,

.. math::

    \forall p, q, f: ((p \equiv q) \land f(p)) \implies f(q)

In essence, this definition asserts that if two conditions are satisfied, then *f* may be regarded as truth-function.

First, it must be the case :math:`p` and :math:`q` are indistinguishable through their :ref:`truth-value <truth-values>`. The propositions ":math:`(5 - 2) \cdot (5 + 2) - 21 = 0`", "*Earth has one moon*", "*George Washington was the first president*", "*The Vietnam War followed the Korean War*" must all be regarded as tokens of the same type of ":ref:`truth <truth>`", i.e. a syntactic :ref:`truth <truth>` that may be shunted through the laws of tautology. This is a loose constraint on what propositions are to be regarded as "equivalent". The only thing that need unite propositions into a equivalency is they be regarded as true under a particular assignment.

Second, there must be a *f* that is well-defined for *p*, e.q. :math:`x^2 \in C` ("a square is a continuous function"), "'Earth has one moon' has one subject.", "'George Washington was the first president' belongs to American History". *f* is a descriptive predicative that abstracts out of its subject a property and asserts a categorical relation with respect to it, e.g. "*All propositions of the form* ':math:`p \land q`' *are true when* :math:`p \implies q` *and* :math:`p` *are both true*" or "*Some propositions of the form* :math:`p \lor q` *are true when p is true*".

*f* is a type of *meta-tautology*, a vacuous :ref:`truth <truth>` of the second order, in contrast to a first order tautology such as :math:`p \lor \neg p`. It is not a tautology *in* the :ref:`language <language>`, but a tautology *about* a :ref:`language <language>`. To say the subject ":math:`1+4+9+16` *is a sum of squares*" is to restate through predication what is already demonstrated through the subject. The description is reflexive. This type of analysis is reminiscent of Aristotelian reciprocals,

.. epigraph::

    We may perhaps most easily comprehend that to which a thing is related, when a name does not exist, if, from that which has a name, we derive a new name, and apply it to that with which the first is reciprocally connected, as in the aforesaid instances, when we derived the word 'winged' from 'wing' and from 'rudder' the word 'ruddered.'  For example, suppose the correlative of 'head' were to be defined as 'animal' - this would be inept and inaccurate. For animal is the correlative of 'man' or 'ox' or other things of that kind, whereas 'head' is held to be correlative to 'that which has a head'. If, therefore, we are to discover the proper correlative of 'head', we might state it as 'headed'. If, however, there were no such word as 'headed', we should have to invent one for the purpose, just as in the instances given above where we coined the words 'winged' and 'ruddered.' For 1  'wing' is relative to 'winged' and 'rudder' to 'ruddered.'

    -- `Categories`_, Aristotle

To see in detail what is meant by this definition, it instructive to analyze it through application, to understand how its meaning is built up through its components. Since the definition is being quantified over the domain of propositions, i.e. those objects which can be regarded as either true or false, it suffices to restrict attention to the possible assignments to these propositions, to see what conditions they impose through the definition on the form of the :ref:`truth <truth>` function :math:`f(p)`.

If :math:`p` is true and :math:`q` is true, then the equivalency relation in the definition holds. If it :math:`f(p)` is false, then any assignment to :math:`f(q)` will satisfy the definition. In short, if *p* and *q* are equivalent, then the definition is equivalent to,

.. math::

    f(p) \implies f(q)

If :math:`p` is false and :math:`q` is true, or visa versa, the equivalency relation in the definition fails to obtain. If the hypothesis of the implication is false, then the consequence may be either true or false. Thus, in these cases, any assignment to :math:`f(p)` and :math:`f(q)` will satisfy the definition.

If :math:`p` is false and :math:`q` is false, or if :math:`p` is true and :math:`q` is true, then the equivalency is true. Then, either :math:`f(p)` is true, or it is false. If it is true, then the implication is only true is :math:`f(q)` is also true. If it :math:`f(p)` is false, then any assignment to :math:`f(q)` will satisfy the definition. In short, if *p* and *q* are equivalent, then the definition is equivalent to,

.. math::

    f(p) \implies f(q)

Thus, if :math:`p` and :math:`q` are equivalent, **and** if :math:`f(p)` expresses a true property of *p*, then :math:`f(q)` also expresses a true property of *q*.

The insight to be gleaned here is this definition does not *fully* determine the form of :math:`f(q)`. It only imposes conditions on :math:`f(q)` when syntactical conditions align.

**Theorem** :math:`\forall p: \neg (\forall q: p \equiv as(q))`

To derive an English translation that avoids unnecessary convolutions, it must be tautologically re-expressed in a different form. Keeping in mind the laws of quantification,

.. math::

    \neg \forall x: f(x) \equiv \exists x: \neg f(x)

This can be restated as,

.. math::

    \forall p: \exists q: p \not\equiv as(q)

Which provides an serviceable translation into English: There is no proposition which is equivalent to the assertion of all propositions.

**Theorem** :math:`\forall p,q: (\forall r: p \equiv as(r)) \equiv (\forall r: q \equiv as(r))`

Every assertion of all propositions is equivalent to any other assertion of all propositions.

**Theorem** :math:`\forall p, q: (\forall f: p \equiv ((\forall r: p \equiv f(r) ) \equiv (\forall r: q \equiv f(r)))) \implies p`

One proposition being equivalent to the equivalency of all equivalent properties of another proposition implies the proposition.

**Theorem** :math:`\forall p,q: (\forall f: p \equiv ((\forall r: p \equiv f(r)) \equiv (\forall r: q \equiv f(r))) ) \implies (p \land q)`

One proposition being equivalent to the equivalency of all equivalent properties of another proposition implies both propositions.

**Theorem** :math:`\forall p, q, f: (p \land q) \implies (p \equiv ((\forall r: p \equiv (fr)) \equiv (\forall r: q \equiv f(r))))`

Two propositions together imply one proposition is equivalent to the equivalency of all equivalent properties of the other proposition,

**Theorem** :math:`\forall p,q: (p \land q) \equiv (\forall f: p \equiv ((\forall r: p \equiv f(r)) \equiv (\forall r: q \equiv f(r))))`

Two propositions together is equivalent to one proposition being equivalent to the equivalency of all equivalent properties of the other proposition.

Deductive Science
-----------------

In his 1930 paper *On Fundamental Concepts of the Methodology of Deductive Sciences*, Tarski began to refine his notion of :ref:`truth <truth>` by incorporating semantics into his constructions. Or, to more accurate, he refined his notion of :ref:`truth <truth>` by making the semantic assignment of :ref:`truth <truth>` a primitive notion. In this paper, Tarski starts by assuming the sentences under analysis have already been interpretted within the semantics of a science.

.. topic:: Definitions

    1. :math:`S`: The set of all meaningful sentences in a science.
    2. :math:`A`: An arbitrary subset of **S**.
    3. :math:`C_n(A)`
    4. :math:`E_{f(x)}[ ... ]`: The set of all values of the function *f* corresponding to those values of the argument *x* which satisfy the condition formulated in the brackets "[..]".
    5. :math:`\mathbb{P}(A) = E_X[X \subseteq A]`: The powerset of A, i.e. the set of all subsets of A.
    6. :math:`\mathbb{F} = E_X[ \lvert X \rvert \leq \aleph_0]`: The set of all finite "inductive"sets.

With these minimalistic definitions, Tarski offers up four axioms to construct a science of science,

.. topic:: Axiom 1

    .. math::

        \lvert S \rvert \leq \aleph_0

.. topic:: Axiom 2

    If :math:`A \subseteq S` then :math:`A \subseteq C_n(A) \subseteq S`

.. topic:: Axiom 3

    If :math:`A \subseteq S` then :math:`C_n(C_n(A)) = C_n(A)`

.. topic:: Axiom 4

    If :math:`A \subseteq S` then :math:`C_n (A) = \sum_{X \in \mathbb{P}(A) \cdot \mathbb{F}} C_n(X)`

Upon reflection, Axiom 1 and Axiom 4 may appear to be at odds. It is instructive to highlight the tension that seems to exist between these two axioms and show the way in which this apparent tension is resolved. Axiom 1 of Tarski's deductive system asserts the set of meaningful sentences in a science is at most countably infinite. In fact, after introducing the axiom, in a brief aside, Tarski mentions in an aside that strict equality in Axiom 1 can be assumed without comprising his results.

Axiom 4, on the other hand, states the consequences of an arbitrary subset of meaningful sentences, :math:`A`, is the sum of consequences of sets taken over finite subsets of :math:`A`. Given that Axiom 1 states that :math:`S` is potentially infinte and the hypothesis of Axiom 4 allows the case :math:`A = S`, Axiom 4 appears to state the infinite set :math:`S` is the result of a finite union. In fact, Axiom 1 and Axiom 4 taken together *do assert* an infinite set is the result of a finite union. However, it is a finite union of *consequences*, which are not necessarily finite.

To understand the subtlety of Axiom 1 and Axiom 4, it suffices to consider

.. math::

    C_n({})

Which is to ask: what are the consequences of *nothing*? The consequences of *nothing* are exactly those propositions which are vacuously true, namely tautologies. Every tautological form generates an infinite number of tautologies through the recursive nature of the substitution principle. Take for example the law of the excluded middle, substituted into itself ad infinitum,

.. math::

    p \lor \neg p, (p \lor \neg p) \lor \neg(p \lor \neg p), ...

Thus, it is seen that even though Axiom 4 asserts an infinite set can be reduced to a finite number of unions, the terms of the union are not finite. In light of the recursive nature of tautologies, Tarski's offhand assertion regarding the infinite cardinality of :math:`S` becomes more plausible.

**Theorem** If :math:`A \subseteq B \subseteq S`, then :math:`C_n(A) \subseteq C_n(B)`

If one :ref:`corpus <corpus>` is contained in another :ref:`corpus <corpus>`, then the consequences of the first :ref:`corpus <corpus>` are contained in the consequences of the second :ref:`corpus <corpus>`. In effect, this means the consequences of a part of a deductive science cannot exceed the consequences of the whole of a deductive science.

By assumption,

.. math::

    A \subseteq B \implies P(A) \subset P(B)

And in turn,

.. math::

    P(A) \subseteq P(B) \implies P(A) \cdot \mathbb{F} \subset P(B) \cdot \mathbb{F}

In other words, the indices of the sum for :math:`C_n(A)` are included in the indices of the sum for :math:`C_n(B)`, meaning all of the elements in :math:`C_n(a)` are also elements of :math:`C_n(B)` but elements in :math:`C_n(B)` are not necessarily elements of :math:`C_n(A)`, whereby it follows from the definition of unions and subsets,

.. math::

    C_n(A) \subseteq C_n(B)

We imagine :ref:`language <language>` to behave like objects, because it manifests through objects. But objectification removes the object from its surroundings. It decontextualizes it. We think :ref:`language <language>` is something definite, something well defined. But it's more like vague constellations, networks of meanings. Everything connects to everything else. :ref:`Language <language>` is the ability to synthesize. It can have layers. Anything can represent anything. And when you remove one connection, the rest blossom to take its place.

Linguistic Structures
---------------------

What is :ref:`language <language>`? Did it emerge gradually or all at once? Was there a point in time when no :ref:`language <language>` existed and the next it did?

Does the distinction between :ref:`meta-language <language>` and :ref:`object language <language>` exist in actuality? Is there a :ref:`language <language>` *about* :ref:`language <language>`, where the general conditions for :ref:`language <language>` can be precisely specified? What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for :ref:`language <language>`? Can :ref:`language <language>` be described in aggregate?

The nature of :ref:`language <language>` is elusive. It begs an unending series of questions and offers little in the way of answers. It resists definition, for definitions occur within it. It resists analysis, for analysis occurs within it. :ref:`Language <language>` is a vicuous circle. :ref:`Language <language>` is *the* vicuous circle, from which all others originate. Language is inescapable and intractable. One might attempt to formalize :ref:`language <language>`, but every attempt hitherto has failed. There are always aspects of :ref:`language <language>` that exceed any container we construct for it. Indeed, there appear to be certain syntactical constraints that can be placed on the general science of :ref:`language <language>`:

1. :ref:`Language <language>` is a hierarchy of ordered sequences. Words are ordered sequences of characters. Sentences are ordered sequences of words.

This seems fundamental. If there is a purely logical and formal principle underlying :ref:`language <language>`, surely this is it.  Almost every known :ref:`language <language>` conforms to this model, in some way. However, even with this meager claim, the most miniscule of structural propositions (that structure *exists*), counter-examples can be produced that show this :ref:`axiom <section-ii-ii>` fails to span the entire breadth of the phenomenon of :ref:`language <language>`.

To start, the concept of declension immediately challenges this hierarchical model of :ref:`language <language>`. In :ref:`languages <language>` like Greek or Latin, the suffixes appended to words denote its part of speech. Consider the three Latin sentences,

- Puella canem videt. (Girl dog sees)
- Canem puella videt. (Dog girl sees)
- Videt puella canem. (Sees girl dog)

Each sentence, in essence, expresses the same proposition, showing that sentences are not necessarily constrained to be ordered sequences of words. The order of the declined words is not *meaningless* in this example, as order in declined :ref:`language <language>` often denotes emphasis, but importantly, it is not the *primary* bearer of meaning. However, the spirit of the model can be recovered by adjusting structure of hierarchy, perhaps by adding a layer above sentence for "*tokens*", of which each of the previous sentences is an instance.

However, there is a more fundamental challenge to the hierarchical model of :ref:`language <language>`. Similar to declension, agglutinative :ref:`languages <language>` accumulate meaning through suffixes applied to roots. The boundary between *sentences* and *words* is not well-defined in an agglutinative :ref:`languages <language>`.

In the Native America :ref:`language <language>` of Central Alaskan Yup'ik,

    tuntussuqatarniksaitengqiggtuq

Translates roughly to "*He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer.*" Describing this linguistic entity as a "*word*" does not fully elucidate its role in Yup'ik :ref:`language <language>`; it would be more accurately classified as a sentence, but that also is not entirely true. The "*words*" of the "*sentence*" are not delimited by blank characters or other marks, so that it appears to an Indo-European speaker to be a single word. This "*sentence-word*" is formed by stacking morphemes into a single word,

1. ``tuntu-``: reindeer
2. ``-ssur-``: to hunt
3. ``-qatar-``: will be going
4. ``-ni-``: to say that
5. ``-ksaite-`` : not yet
6. ``-ngqiggte-`` : again
7. ``-uq``: third person indicative mood

.. note::

    This is a very approximate mapping to English. Take it with a grain of salt.

As another example of an agglutinative phrase, consider the Turkish,

    evlerimde

The root ``ev``, *house*, is modified by a plural suffix ``ler``, a possessive suffix ``im`` and then a prepositional suffix ``de``, so that it translates into English as "*in my houses*". This :ref:`language <language>` formation process may be visualized as a type of functional composition. A root has a grammatical operation applied to it,

.. math::

    \text{plural}(x) = x + \text{ler}

Where :math:`x` is the root and :math:`+` represents concatenation. Similariy, the operators for possession and preposition can represented,

.. math::

    \text{possessive}(x) = x + \text{im}

    \text{preposition}(x) = x + \text{de}

Then, the word ``evlerimde`` can be represented formally as,

.. math::

    \text{preposition}(\text{possessive}(\text{plural}(x)))

In other words, a "*word*" in an agglutinative :ref:`language <language>` is a sequence of operations applied to a root, where the operations *are* the grammatical structure of the :ref:`language <language>`.

The essential nature of :ref:`language <language>` appears to be sequential, but identifying *what* is being sequenced presents a problem. We want to name the terms of linguistic science, but there seems to be no universal property that is manifested in every instance of :ref:`language <language>`.

To reconcile these two distinct categories of :ref:`language <language>` (called *synthetic* and *analytic*), linguistics often treats *morphemes* as the smallest semantic unit (the smallest token in a sentence that bears meaning), from which larger complexes are constructed.

However, there is a subtle problem in this model, which is not necessarily a flaw, but does commit its proponents to an ontological position they might not be willing to adopt were it made explicit.

The morpheme model of :ref:`language <language>` that unifies analytic and synthetic :ref:`languages <language>` requires viewing the referents of signs (symbols, abstractions) indirectly. In other words, a sign from this model does not directly signify the signified, but does so through modalities that alter its apparent form. To state more clearly, this :ref:`language <language>` model supposes a universal term preexists the particular instance of it within the sentence and moreover, it supposes the essential process of :ref:`language <language>` is to instantiates these universals into particular words or sentences.

Moreover, this abstraction requires syntactic artifices like *null morphemes* to describe how morphological operators behave when applied to certain lexical roots,

.. math::

    \text{plural}(\text{horse}) = \text{horse} + \text{s}

    \text{plural}(\text{deer}) = \text{deer} + \varnothing

However, this representation is slightly misleading in its form. A more accurate formal model would distinguish the tokens "deer" and "horse" (i.e. the *names* of their conceptual locus) from their written representation. Letting :math:`\mathfrak{x}` stand for the token, :math:`x` for its written representation and :math:`f` for the morphological operator,

.. math::

    f(\mathfrak{x}) = x + s

    f(\mathfrak{y}) = y + \varnothing

The important point in this formalization is that the token and the representation exist in different domains; one is mapped to the other.

In other words, this model seems to assert that when a speaker utters "*the cat is here*", the speaker is necessarily comprehending the word "*cat*" indirectly as the result of applying a :math:`\text{singular}()` operator to an underlying *essence*. Linguistics, it seems, has an implicit stance on the Aristotelian problem of the Universal, namely that universals exist, insofar as language is concerned.

A universal motif of creation myths is the prominence of *speaking* and *naming*. Almost every myth that attempts to elucidate the origins of existence describes a process where the very act of speech induces creation. The world is portrayed as *formless* and *void*, a sea of primordial *chaos*; it is :ref:`language <language>` itself that give structure to the penumbral shadow, pulling it into light and casting it into :ref:`beings <being>`. The ubiquity of this theme across different historical eras and disparate geographic areas suggests it is not merely random or circumstantial, but indicative of the fundamental pathology that language induces in the human mind.

Any assertions about the origin and historical development of :ref:`language <language>` must remain speculation, but nonetheless, certain patterns emerge from the available evidence. The earliest records of written :ref:`language <language>`, such as Ancient Egyptian or Sumerian, are pictographic in nature, meaning there tends to be a direct correspondence between the symbol and the object it represents, e.g. a sun is represented by a starburst or a fish by the crisscrossed curves that form its shape. The grammar of a purely pictographic :ref:`language <language>` is primarily extensional, meaning it does not have the syntactic glue to bind its presented concepts into complex relations except through their mere presentation. A pictogram of an axe juxtaposed with a pictogram of tree implies a certain action, but it does not contain complex modalities like motive, temporality or setting. Its possible interpretations are limited to simple utterances, "* tree cut down*" or "*man cuts tree*"; there are no syntactic markers upon which to hang the semantics of *why*, *how*, *when* or *if*.

As :ref:`language <language>` evolves, its progression into abstraction is apparaent. The correspondence between the signifier and the signified is almost entirely severed as linguistic forms accumulate syntactic functions and these functions become the bearers of meaning beyond the directly indicative; Language is no longer a direct mapping between object and sign. The `following diagram <https://www.britannica.com/topic/writing/Sumerian-writing>`_ shows the evolution of cunieform, from simple pictograms to abstract symbols,

.. image:: ../_static/img/context/anthropological/cuneiform-evolution.jpg
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Encyclopedia Britannica Cuneiform Table
   :align: center

The lefthand column pictograms are clearly direct representations of the underlying concept, a visual analogue of reality. The grammar of such a system cannot help being analogical by mimicking the perceived the relations of reality through their direct image in writing. There is no other way to represent relations except spatially, i.e. by placing the symbol for "*foot*" next to the symbol for "*road*" to indicate the action of "*walking*". Actions, and the complex relations which factor into motive forms, are reduced to the aggregation of their constituent objects.

This type of representation offers little in the way of symbolically presenting the internal state of a human. There is no way to conceive of "*self*" in a pictographic system, because a "*self*" cannot be represented graphically. In other words, the "*self*" never sees itself because it is the thing that *sees*. The conceptualization of "*self*" requires semantic features this form of :ref:`language <language>` does not possess.

.. topic:: Conjecture

    Early creation myths are records of the transformation every :ref:`language <language>` must undergo to provide the linguistic apparatus for progressing from purely visual and analogical to the abstract and metaphorical. Creation myths are literal linguistic artifacts of early humans attempting (or inventing the terms) to describe the transformation they were undergoing, from a form of consciousness primarily grounded in immediate perception and external representation to a form of highly symbolic abstraction that allows (or induces) a conceptualization of "*self*".

The sheer breadth of history that separates the current time period from the moment when creation myths were actually written precludes any positive verification of this claim, so all evidence will necessarily be circumstantial. Bearing that in mind, a particularly compelling piece of evidence for this claim is demonstrated in *Exodus 3:14*, when Moses asks for the name of God to give to his people. God replies,

    אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה

    Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh

This phrase presents significant challenges when translated into modern English. It is often rendered as one of the following,

    I am who I am

    I am that I am

    I will be what I will be

    I am the being
 
    I am the one who is

These translations are influenced and constrainted by the historical trajectory of the Torah through Greek and Latin cultures. When translated into the Greek Septuagint, the original Hebrew phrase became,

    Ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ὤν

The Greek Septuagint introduced a definite article in the form of "*ὁ*" and a personal first person in "*Ἐγώ*" in order to reconstruct the perceived meaning of Ancient Hebrew within Koine Greek. More fundamental, it translated "*אֶהְיֶה (ehyeh)*" into the present tense of "*εἰμι (eimi)*". The effects have been passed down to present day translations like King James. However, the original meaning of the "*Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh*" is not entirely captured by any of these translations.

Ancient Hebrew did not have a modality for time. Its verbs were given aspects, but not temporality. A Hebrew verb has a *perfect* aspect and an *imperfect* aspect. The *perfect* aspect denotes completed or singular actions. This is sometimes called the *gnomic* mode or tense. In English, some examples are given in the following,

- It has been decided.
- The sun rises.
- The birds are fast.

However, these statements, while exhibiting *perfect* aspect, by their instantiation in English, are necessarily inflected with temporality, e.g. "*rises*" or "*has been*". Again, it is crucial to note Ancient Hebrew did not have this modality.

The *imperfect* aspect denotes an incomplete, ongoing or potential action. In English, some examples are given,

- They will go.
- The bird sings every morning.
- The store used to be open.

"*אֶהְיֶה (ehyeh)*" is the first person singular imperfect form of "*הָיָה (hayah)*", which translate into "*to be*", "*to become*", "*to exist*". "*אֶהְיֶה (ehyeh)*" is the Ancient Hebrew concept of :ref:`being <being>`.

"*אֲשֶׁר (asher)*" is a linguistic relativizer, analogous to the English "*that*" or "*which*". A relativizer plays a role not dissimilar to the role of quantification in symbolic logic, in that it provides conditions for its clause to obtain, i.e.,

- the lady from Chicago that sang a tune.
- the brown dog which ran away.
- the man that wasn't there.

These examples show the function of a relativizer is to qualify its clauses. With these facts in mind, the literal English translation of "*אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה*" is,

    am that am

    am which am

The question then becomes in what *mode* to interpret the "*am*", i.e. as a potentiality, a habituality or ongoing process. Regardless, taken in conjunction with the previous conjecture, God's reply to Moses appears to identify divinity itself with the conjugation of :ref:`being <being>` into its *imperfect first person modality* of "*am*". Moreover, that :ref:`being <being>` is qualified relative to itself.

.. topic:: Conjecture

    Early humans did not have the concept of "*self*" until :ref:`language <language>` had evolved to the point where abstraction, complex predication and metaphor was possible.

It is easy to be fooled by the apparent continuity of our "*self*" through time and space that consciousness is a single thing, everywhere equivalent in its multiplicity. We assume our consciousness is in every way identical to every other, except for its particular circumstances, that we might substitute our "*self*" into another's without alteration. That no one remembers their birth or early youth except in fragments is dismissed because however blurry the memory, we remember our self ":ref:`being there <being>`". We don't account for the role that :ref:`language <language>` plays in the development of our "*self*". Humans are essentially vessels for :ref:`language <language>`. Our earliest records are (*allegedly*) suffused with the history of consciousness itself.

If the conjecture is granted, the question remains: what is the "*self*"? How does the modality of "*am*" that evolved from the concept of :ref:`being` allow the "*self*" to take root? Is the "*self*" created or described by this evolution of :ref:`language <language>`? Conceding to the ever present specter of uncerainty, the question is essentially: does :ref:`language <language>` *induce* self-awareness or does it provide the formal framework for its interpretation?

Truth Abstractions
------------------

.. epigraph::

    For the sake of greater perspicuity, we shall use the symbol '*c*' as a typographical abbreviations of the expression '*the sentence printed on this page, line 5 from the top*'. Consider now the following sentence:

        *c is not a true sentence*  (Note: this sentence is typeset on line 5)

    Having regard to the meaning of the symbol 'c', we can establish empirically:

        1. 'c is not a true sentence' is identical with *c*

    For the quotation-mark name of the sentence *c* (or for any other of its names), we can set up an explanation of type:

        2. 'c is not a true sentence' is a true sentence if and only c is not a true sentence.

    The premises 1 and 2 together at once give a contradiction:

        c is a true sentence if and only if c is not a true sentence.

    - `The Concept of Truth in Formalized Languages`_, Alfred Tarski

From this, Tarski concludes that "*colloquial* :ref:`language <language>`" is hopelessly inconsistent. :ref:`Truth <truth>` *about* a :ref:`language <language>` never exists *within* that language. Tarski is saying, in the mathematically ineluctable way of *proof by contradiction*, that by assuming ":ref:`language <language>`" is a singular entity where all descriptions occur on the same level, contradictions necessarily result. Therefore, to salvage the concept of ":ref:`truth <truth>`", Tarski famously introduces the distinction between *meta* :ref:`language <language>` and *object* :ref:`language <language>`,

.. epigraph::

    For this reason, when we investigate the :ref:`language <language>` of a formalized deductive science, we must always distinguish clearly between the :ref:`language <language>` *about* which we speak and the :ref:`language <language>` *in* which we speak, as well as between the science which is the object of our investigation and the science in which the investigation is being carried out. The names of the expressions of the first language, and of the relations between them, belong to the second language, called the *meta* :ref:`language <language>` (which may contain the first as a part). The description of these expressions, the definition of the complicated concepts, especially of those connected with the construction of a deductive theory (like the concept of consequence, of provable sentence, possibly of true sentence), the determiniation of the properties of these concepts, is the task of the second theory which we shall call the *metatheory*.

    - `The Concept of Truth in Formalized Languages`_, Alfred Tarski

In other words, the notion of "*truth*" requires a bifurcation of :ref:`language <language>`. If we want the discourse to include predicates of "*is true*" or "*is false*", :ref:`language <language>` cannot be treated as one cohesive unit, where these assertions are carried out in the same :ref:`language <language>` in which what is being asserted *is asserted*. This idea is only strange if :ref:`language <language>` is regarded as something fixed and determinate. However, it is more apt to think of :ref:`language <language>` as a *continuous process that accumulates components of orthogonal meaning over time*. Each syntactic construct allows new semantic meaning to be encoded into the artifice of :ref:`language <language>`, and each new semantic concept integrated into the fabric of :ref:`language <language>` alters what is demarcated by its boundaries. In other words, :ref:`language <language>` can only be conceived of as a whole at certain points in time, when its definitions are fixed by their factical origin in the world. But the cross section of :ref:`language <language>` at any given moment does not capture its dynamic nature across time; in fact, this nontemporal model of :ref:`language <language>` fails to represent in any capacity beyond the formal the essential nature of :ref:`language <language>`.

Tarski's parsimony of meta and object :ref:`language <language>` shows that ":ref:`truth <truth>`" represents one of these transformative concepts that alters the very constitution of :ref:`language <language>` through its introduction and analysis. In essence, the concept of ":ref:`truth <truth>`", through its rigorous integration into the corpus of :ref:`language <language>`, creates a schism in :ref:`language <language>`. If we allow ourselves to accept ":ref:`truth <truth>`" as a meaningful construct, then we must accept this molecular division of :ref:`language <language>` into separate, but related, domains.

.. important::

    It should be noted this division is only necessary if one concedes to the premise that contradictions should not be syntactically expressible within a :ref:`language <language>`.

The apparent *incompleteness* of :ref:`language <language>`, i.e. its inability to be fully reduced to formal representation, arises because we each view words and sentences as a representative instances plucked from the supposed totality of :ref:`language <language>`. But Tarski has shown, by revealing the circular logic of :ref:`truth <truth>`, that :ref:`language <language>` *is not a totality* and any attempt to treat it as such will result in contradiction.

.. epigraph::

    Vicious circles arise from supposing that a collection of objects may contain members which can only be defined by means of the collection as a whole. Thus, for example, the collection of propositions will be supposed to contain a proposition stating that "*all propositions are either true or false.*” It would seem, however, that such a statement could not be legitimate unless “*all propositions*” referred to some already definite collection, which it cannot do if new propositions are created by statements about “*all propositions*”. We shall, therefore, have to say that statements about “*all propositions*” are meaningless. More generally, given any set of objects such that, if we suppose the set to have a total, it will contain members which presuppose this total, then such a set cannot have a total. By saying that a set has “*no total*,” we mean, primarily, that no significant statement can be made about “*all its members.*”

    - `Principia Mathematica`_, Bertrand Russell and Alfred Whitehead

We say, "*this word is* :ref:`language <language>`" or "*this sentence is* :ref:`language <language>`", having misunderstood what is designated by the term ":ref:`language`". We view :ref:`language <language>` as a *structure*, as a collection extensionally determined by its members, instead of a *structuring*, as the *intension* which composes the determination. *Structures* must possess parts in determinate relations, whereas *structuring* is the very process by which parts are arranged into and imbued with *structure*. In other words, the predicate "*is* :ref:`language`", like the predicates "*is true*" or "*is false*", never occurs within :ref:`language <language>`, but indicates a rupture in the foundations of :ref:`language <language>`. This rupture *is* the essence of :ref:`language <language>`, to bring within its field of containment something entirely disparate from its other elements.

.. epigraph::

    Ask yourself whether our :ref:`language <language>` is complete-—whether it was so before the symbolism of chemistry and the notation of the infinitesimal calculus were incorporated in it; for these are, so to speak, suburbs of our :ref:`language <language>`. (And how many houses or streets does it take before a town begins to be a town?) Our :ref:`language <language>` can be seen as an ancient city: a maze of little streets and squares, of old and new houses, and of houses with additions from various periods; and this surrounded by a multitude of new boroughs with straight regular streets and uniform houses.

    -- `Philosophical Investigations`_, Ludwig Wittenstein

Ask yourself: What do "*equals*", "*or*" and "*all*" have in common beyond their inclusion in :ref:`language <language>`? All three serve distinct linguistic functions, that of identity, disjunction and categorical assertion respectively. They are employed a certain way, to encode meaning a certain way. They have no commonality beyond being :ref:`language <language>`. To call "*these words*" :ref:`language <language>` is directly analogous to collecting an abacus, a paint brush and a hammer under the header of a single concept. The way an abacus is engaged in action and the meaning of its movements, is vastly and materially different than the action and movement of a hammer or paintbrush.

In Tarski's conception, :ref:`truth <truth>` is a property expressed in the meta :ref:`language <language>`, *not* the object :ref:`language <language>`. When the :ref:`assignment <value-assignment>` of values to the terms of the object :ref:`language <language>` satisfies a :ref:`proposition <proposition>` of the meta :ref:`language <language>` for all possible :ref:`assignments <value-assignment>`, then the result is said "*to be true*". Tarski defines :ref:`truth <truth>` relative to the combinatorial totality of value assignments. :ref:`Truth <truth>` is the semantic locus point of *syntactic satisfaction* across all possible interpretations.

Abstract Contradictions: A History of Propositions
--------------------------------------------------

:ref:`Set theory <sets>` is a formal system that is often used as a meta :ref:`language <language>` in mathematics to specify the conditions of object :ref:`languages <language>`, e.g. differential and integral calculus, real and complex analysis, etc. In many ways, :ref:`set theory <sets>` is the formal crystallization of the logical dialectic initiated by Aristotle in the Organon. :ref:`Axiomatic set theory <sets>`, in its various formulations, represents the purely symbolic and syntactic limit of categorical logic, the maximum extent to which language can be shaped by formal considerations. In doing so, it must restrict itself to the *metalogical* layer, never penetrating below the surface of description. 

It is instructive to consider the history of the *proposition*, for the *proposition* is at once a sentence and a unit of mathematics, a :ref:`truth value <truth-values>`. The proposition is a both a *meaningful* thing and a *formal* thing. The history of philosophy and mathematics is, by and large, an analysis and gradual unveiling of the relations that bind *form* to *meaning*, *syntax* to *semantics*.

    Heidegger would call this translation *latinized*, and point out the components underlying the meaning of *οὐσία*. *οὐσία* is derived from the feminine present participle of *εἶναι* (*to be*), *οὖσα*, but it is also etymologically related to *παρουσία* (*being-at, present*). Heidegger would likely contend the translation of *οὐσία* is better served by the term "*presence*".

Aristotle regarded a :ref:`proposition <proposition>` as a representation of :ref:`being <being>`, and thought of the syntax of :ref:`propositions <proposition>` as manifestations of the different *categories* of :ref:`being <being>`. Aristotle's ontology regarded :ref:`being <being>` as a relationship of predication that ultimately resolved to a category predicated of the primitive subject, termed the "*οὐσία*" (often translated as *substance*). Aristotle defined the nature of the predicative relations in `Categories`_, summarized below,

1. Substance (*οὐσία*): What something fundamentally is.
2. Quantity (*ποσόν*): How much or how many of the subtance exists.
3. Quality (*ποιόν*): What kind or sort of thing a substance is.
4. Relation (*πρός τι*): How a substance stands in reference to another substance.
5. Place (*ποῦ*): Where the substance is located.
6. Time (*πότε*): When the substance exists.
7. Position (*κεῖσθαι*): The physical arrangement of the substance's parts.
8. State (*ἔχειν*): The condition or state of having something.
9. Action (*ποιεῖν*): What the substance is actively doing.
10. Passion (*πάσχειν*): What is being done to the substance.

Aristotle viewed the predication of a category as applying to either the entire *οὐσία*, a part of the *οὐσία* or none of the *οὐσία*. Modern :ref:`logic <logic>` tends to view this as the equivalent of :ref:`quantification <logical-quantification>`, but as Peter Abelard pointed out (see below) this type *Aristotelian* :ref:`quantification <logical-quantification>` has important differences that are not present in its modern descendant. These differences are themselves rooted in the *lack* of material difference in the ancient concepts of :ref:`logic <logic>` and ontology; when Aristotle is expounding his :ref:`logic <logic>` in `Prior Analytics`_, he is not making formal (*syntactic*, :ref:`tautological <tautologies>`) arguments, he is making ontological (*semantic*, *interpretative*) arguments. This becomes clear when he "*proves*" his syllogistic figures by appeal to ordered triplets of *things*.

The division of :ref:`logic <logic>` and ontology into separate domains of discourse did not occur until much later, its beginnings emerging approximately in parallel with the Renaisannce era, when figures like Boole began to probe and map the formal properties of :ref:`logic <logic>`, eventually leading to successive revolutions of Frege, Russell, Gödel and Tarski, which effectively isolated :ref:`logic <logic>` from ontology by reducing the subject's presence in the ancient science to the role of interpretation. 

.. sidebar::

    Badiou's pronouncement, `mathematics is ontology <Being and Event>`_ is an attempt to return ontology to formal discourse. However, as this essay will argue, his pronouncement is *essentially* incorrect. Mathematics is *metaphysics*, or atleast as close as a subject can get without thereby becoming it. 

In the modern conception of :ref:`logic <logic>`, the subject's role lies in finding a real world model that *satifies* the syntactical properties of the formal model under the assignment (indexing) of empirical objects to the symbolic terms of the :ref:`language <language>`. The formal model has no responsibility to comport itself towards :ref:`being <being>` real; the one interpretting the model must find its coherent interpretation in reality. A significant portion of modern mathematics is nothing more than the production of formal theorems unanchored by empirical reality, often justified by appeal to other instances of theoretical constructs finding unintended interpretations, e.g. the axioms of probability in geometric proportions, imaginary numbers in engineering applications, etc. The *intension* of :ref:`Aristotelian logic <aristotelian-logic>`, however, is to explicitly elaborate the structure of :ref:`being <being>`, first and foremost.

However, within the :ref:`logic <logic>` of Aristotle, there is a subtle flaw which betokens why :ref:`logic <logic>` and :ref:`language <language>` must remain isolated from an equivalency with :ref:`being <being>`. In `Prior Analytics`_, Aristotle often uses what he termed a "*positive conversion*" from a universally affirmed premise to particular premise,

.. epigraph::

    The positive premise necessarily converts, thought not universally but in part. For instance, if every pleasure is a good, then some good will be a pleasure.

    -- `Prior Analytics`_, Aristotle

If the statement "*all B are A*" is rendered as :math:`AaB` and "*some B are A*" as :math:`AiB`, a positive conversion of a premise can be formalized as, 

.. math::
    
    AaB \to AiB

Aristotle also applied particular conversions,

.. math::

    AiB \to BiA

Which is to say, if "*some B is A*" is true, then "*some A is B*" is also true, the classic example cited above in this instance becoming "*if some pleasure is good, then some good is pleasure*". These two conversions [#may_2025_01]_ form the core of Aristotle's deductive calculus. Aristotle viewed a deduction (*συλλογισμός*) as a ontological rule where two categorical premises implied a categorical conclusion. The classic *Barbara* deduction is formalized as, 

.. math::

    AaB, BaC \vdash AaC

Which is rendered into English as, 

    If all B are A and all C are B, then all C are A.

Where :math:`A`, :math:`B` and :math:`C` represent *genera* and *species* of *οὐσία*, for example, *animal*, *man* and *husband*. Aristotle often proves these "*figures*" of deduction by applying a positive universal conversion, as in his proof of the *Darapti* deduction, 

.. math::
    
    PaS, RaS \vdash PiS

.. epigraph::

    When both P and R belong to every S, it results of necessity that P will belong to some R. For since the positive premise converts, S will belong to some R; consequently, since P belongs to every S and S to some R, it is necessary for P to belong to some R (for a deduction through the first figure comes about).

    -- `Prior Analytics`_, Aristotle

The deduction rule :math:`AaB \to AiB` is often termed a deduction of *existential import*, for it implicitly assumes the existence of its premise. Abelard brought this subtle fallacy to light in his *Dialectica*,

.. epigraph::

    If '*every stone-man is a stone*' is true, also its conversion per accidens is true ('*some stones are stone-men*'). But no stone is a stone-man, because neither this man nor that man etc. is a stone. But also this '*a certain stone-man is not a stone*' is false by necessity, since it is impossible to suppose it is true.

    -- Dialectica, Abelard

What Abelard is pointing out is a notion that would not be formalized for another millenia in the strictures of set theory: unrestricted comprehension of an abstraction principle necessarily leads to contradiction. The proposition, "*all stone men are stone*", can be true, syntactically speaking, when no objects exist in the domain that is being quantified, namely "*stone men*". As a consequence, because "*all stone men are stone*" can be true without referring to any actual :ref:`beings <being>`, it is too much to grant a deduction from the universal assertion to a particular instance of a "*stone man*". In other words, "*all*" does not imply "*some*" if nothing exists to satisfy "*all*"; indeed, "*all*" must be conditioned on a presupposed existent *thing*. 

The problem of *existential import* bears similarity to the problem that plagued Frege's `Grundgesetze Der Arithmetik`_ . To see how the conundrum of existence ruptures Frege's :ref:`logic <logic>` from the inside out, one must understand how Frege departed from the Aristotelian model of :ref:`logic <logic>` Frege conceived of a proposition *extensionally*, as opposed to *categorically*. To Frege, a proposition is a formula that is *satisfied* by certain objects. For example, ":math:`x` *is even*" is a proposition *satisfied* by the series of numbers :math:`0, 2, 4, ...`; Frege thought of each proposition as implicitly expressing the relation of "*belonging*" between an object :math:`x` and a (*value-range or extension of a*) concept :math:`\hat{\epsilon}f`, where the relation is manifested through a property predicated of each object abstracted into a "*collection*". In other words, Frege saw *predication* as being equivalent to *abstraction*.

For example, to say, "*this pen belongs to the concept of Black*" is equivalent to saying "*this pen is a black object*". Note in these examples the division between the near-Platonic formal nature of "*Black*" and the near-Aristotelian predication of "*black*". The use of capitalization is intentional, for Frege would call "*Black*" a proper name and "*black*" a description. According to Frege, "*Black*" is the abstract concept common to all instances of black things. In other words, Frege has committed himself to a stance on the problem of universals, namely that they exist. 

Moreover, Fregean concepts exist as *terms* in the language from which they arose as abstractions. Frege asserted, for all objects :math:`x`, the property :math:`f` being equal to the property :math:`g` is equivalent to saying the concept :math:`\hat{\epsilon}f` and the concept :math:`\hat{\epsilon}g` are the same concept,

.. math::

    (\forall x: f(x) \equiv g(x)) \equiv (\hat{\epsilon}f = \hat{\epsilon}g)

The righthand side of this equivalency treats the concepts  :math:`\hat{\epsilon}f` and :math:`\hat{\epsilon}g` as operands in an equality relation, which to say, it treats concepts *as objects in the language of* `Grundgesetze der Arithmetik`_. This :ref:`axiom <frege-axioms>` was called *Law V* by Frege. 

Note this formulation is symmetrical and complementary with the logical law, first posited by Leibniz and adopted by Frege in his `Grundgesetze Der Arithmetik`_, that if two objects have the same properties, they are identical (often known as the Law of Indiscernibles),

.. math::

    \forall a, b: (\forall f: f(a) \equiv f(b)) \equiv (a = b) 

However, instead of quantifying over objects and passing into conceptuality, the Law of Indiscernibles passes into objectivity by quantifying over properties (i.e. abstractions). In other words, the Law of Indiscernible states for all possible properties that can be asserted of two objects, if and only if the objects are the same will all of the asserted properties of those objects be equivalent [#may_2025_02]_. On the other hand, Frege's Law V states, for *all objects*, if and only if the (*extensions of*) concepts are the same will the asserted properties to those concepts be equivalent.

The Law of Indiscernibles qualifies abstractions in their totality and passes into an assertion of equality between the objects which originate the abstraction, whereas Frege's Law V qualifies objects in their totality and then passes into an assertion of equality between their abstractions. Crucially, the Law of Indiscernibles can be *vacuously true*, as in the case of :math:`f` representing such properties as the predicate of "*being impredicable*". However, the quantification in Frege's Law V is *existentially* important for all but the *null* domain; Frege's Law V *assumes the existence of the object being quantified*.

To draw to the surface the lurking shadow of Abelard's stone men from Frege's Law V, and reveal the formal structure of contradiction in Frege's `Grundgesetze Der Arithmetik`_, the notion of "*an object* :math:`x` *belonging to a concept* :math:`\hat{\epsilon}`" must be defined [#may_2025_03]_,

.. math::

    x \frown \hat{\epsilon}f \equiv \exists \phi: (\hat{\epsilon}f = \hat{\epsilon}\phi) \land \phi(x)

That is, asserting :math:`x` *belongs* :math:`\hat{\epsilon}f` is equivalent to asserting there exists a property :math:`\phi` of :math:`x` (denoted :math:`\phi(x)`) *and* the concept (value-range) of :math:`\phi` is equal to :math:`\hat{\epsilon}f` (the concept or value range of :math:`f`). [#may_2025_04]_ It is rightly stated by Frege's commentators that Law V leads directly to the contradiction of Russell's Paradox. This is true, but the manner in which this contradiction arises is often not appreciated. The origin of Russell's Paradox in Frege's system is the existential and creative nature of his definition of membership, :math:`\frown`. From this definition, Law V is used to show,

.. math::

    x \frown \hat{\epsilon}f \equiv f(x)

Which is to say, the assertion of :math:`x` belonging to a concept :math:`\hat{\epsilon}f` is equivalent to the assertion :math:`x` has property :math:`f`. From here, it is a simple matter of letting :math:`f` be the property of not belonging to concept :math:`\hat{\epsilon}f`,

.. math::

    f(x) = \neg (x \frown \hat{\epsilon}f)

Whence the famed Russell's Paradox emerges,

.. math::

    x \frown \hat{\epsilon}f \equiv \neg (x \frown \hat{\epsilon}f)

Clearly, this should not be the case. Historically speaking, this annihiliated Frege's logicist project, but the nature of the deduction which leads to this annihiliation would be the primary motive for the formal insights of Russell and Tarski. To show more clearly how this contradiction arises, consider the following  proof of one direction of :math:`x \frown \hat{\epsilon}f \equiv f(x)`.

Assume :math:`x \frown \hat{\epsilon}f`. 

From the definition of membership, there is a property :math:`\phi(x)` and the concept of this property :math:`\hat{\epsilon}\phi` is equal to the concept of :math:`f`, :math:`\hat{\epsilon{f}}`. 

The question, often known as the *Caesar Problem*, is how does one re-identify the property :math:`\phi` with the property :math:`f`? This is where Frege's Law V comes in; since the definition of membership yields the equality of concepts, Frege's Law V allows the deduction to pass into the equivalence of properties,

.. math::

    \phi(x) = f(x) 

Therefore, if :math:`x \frown \hat{\epsilon}f`, then :math:`f(x)`.

The key step is passing from the universal equality of concepts, an assertion of categorical relation, to an *instance* of the property denoted by the concept. Frege makes the same mistake as Aristotle (:small:`good company to keep`) in assuming a universal relation implies an existential relation.

.. [#may_2025_01] Aristotle has a third conversion rule, :math:`AeB \to BeA`, but it is not mentioned here since it is not relevant to Abelard's critique of *existential import*.

.. [#may_2025_02] Except, however, the property of "*having the name* :math:`a`" and the property of "*having the name* :math:`b`".

.. [#may_2025_03] Frege believed all (coherent) semantic concepts in a language, such as "*belonging*", could be derived from definitions made clearly with the formal laws of logic. His `Grundgesetze Der Arithmetik`_ is an attempt to reduce the mathematical language of arithmetic to a logical calculus, through the use of prior assumptions (:ref:`axioms <frege-axioms>`) and definitions such as the one given directly after this footnote,

.. [#may_2025_04] It is often hard to translate Frege's formalism into everyday language, as if Frege's semantics are essentially alien to the actual mechanics of language. Frege is expressing insight in a language that bears only the faintest similarity to natural language.

:ref:`Language <language>`, if it can be defined at all, is the indeterminate totality which, by never containing itself (or existing), nessitates its progressive advance into novelty.

---

When language ceases, so does life. 

We spend our childhoods learning how to speak, threading our souls with symbols. Language acqusition is like a spell, a black magic ritual that induces in us the world. We are spoken into existence. Our lives are lived through the medium of speech.

All of these concepts accumulated through history, flowing into our heads through the currents of time, met in the external source of the world which unfolds in our senses. One marvels at the complexity. So many facts, shot through and through with interpretations. So many accidents and contingencies, indistinguishable in their effects. 

In the murky factical origins of language, nothing is certain, but somethings are more certain than others. One cannot imagine a world without community. The self implies a multiplicity of selves. We must be bootstrapped with language, taught through ostension the ways in which things can relate to another, before the self as a concept may emerge as a relata within a relation, and this cannot happen without someone to draw attention to the ways in which symbols may represent that latent potential lurking. The "*self*" must be taught to us; it is an evolution of abstraction transmitted through language that manifests in our phenomenological life, in a directly analogous fashion to the way chains of DNA manifest phenotypes. The "*syntax*" of amino acids encodes the potentialites of life; the raw struggle of existence dictates which potentialities are activated, i.e. the "*semantics*" of DNA are determined by the ways in which the phenotypes interact with the existent world. 

It is hard to imagine how a newborn infant could contain the potential for language, except through the possibility of absorbing it from another human. Language is only innate to the extent that is a potential of the human mind (and only then, at crucial periods during the development of the organism, as the case of feral children implies).

---

The world contrives, in its myriad ways, to convince you that you are not part of it. Every historical struggle reduces to this primordial human conflict, in some way. War is only possible in the presence of difference. To participate in conflict, there must be a "*them*" and an "*us*", or more fundamentally, an "*other*" and an "*I*". This psychological :ref:`tautology <tautologies>` is precipitated in its pronouncement by the ontological foundations which allow it to manifest. To speak of tension and energetic relations, there must be external forces contending with internal forces in a quest for equilibrium. In order to cancel out, forces must be opposed. Conversely, all force can be decomposed into opposites.

The law of the excluded middle is a :ref:`logical <logic>` artifact of the separation that divides things in their physical origin. Violence is a consequence of our nature, but an essential consequence (or at least, an essential possibility), one that follows syllogistically from the differentiation of the self from the world. The "*self*" is a name to identify particular thing. Every thing that is named is named insofar that it constitutes a singular thing; however multifoliate its presentation, through naming it is unified across its modes into a thing. A name is a record of separation, a symbol that bestows upon its recipient identity. 

It is easy to take for granted the power of a name. We are given a name as soon as we enter the world, often well before. It is not inaccurate to say: each one of us is born *into* a name as much as we are born into a body. There is no difference, for our names indicate who we are, in all of its potentialities, physical or otherwise. This is the meaning of Kripke's criticism of the "*Fregean theory of names*". A name is not merely a *designation* or *description*, but a *baptism*. To name a thing is to inaugurate it into the possibilities of the world, as another item among the collection with the possiblity of :ref:`being <being>`. 

It is even easier to take for granted there is *no inherent reason* we should have names. We could as well not have names; In fact, it almost certain that humans at some point in history do not have the concept of "*name*". One might posit the emergence of "*names*" even further back in the mammalian lineage of humans, but regardless the point stands: *naming* is a privilege afforded by a particular evolutionary history. So many questions could be answered if we only had precise knowledge of the history that preceded our births, if we could somehow reconstruct the conditions of our ancestors who discovered they could *name* one another. What preceded and necessitated the discovery of *names*? Was it pure happenstance? Was a singular thing nominated to be named, or were several things simultaneously given names? Was there a point in history where only *one* name existed? Did humans realize immediately the sheer breadth of things that could named? 

---

Consider the two substantially different questions: Who was the first human to be named? What was their name? Now consider that, whatever the answer to these questions might be, the literal answer (i.e. the series of characters) is the same each case, but what is denoted by the answer is not. 

In the first case, the answer to the question refers to the bearer of the name. In the second, it refers to the name itself. In other words, a name enables (formal) identity, but a name is *not* the same as (formal) identity. Or to be a finer linguistic point on it: a name is not identical to identity. 

Tarski tells us names do not exist on the same logical level as the :ref:`language <language>` in which the named things are used. A name is not an object; The name of a thing is a different type of thing than the thing itself. 

Obviously, the name itself does not matter, as any symbol whatsoever can stand in place of a thing. In Tarski's view, "*A contains B*" is the name of the sentence: A contains B. But this is only a matter of convention, albeit a deceptive convention that masks the nature of naming. We can as well agree to call the symbol :math:`ᛉ` the name of the sentence: A contains B. Tarski, instead of assigning arbitrary symbols to a name, expressed the name of a symbolic proposition with another symbolic proposition,

    ":math:`B \subset A`" if and only if A contains B. 

This process of naming has no limit,

    "":math:`B \subset A`" if and only if A contains B." if and only if ":math:`B \subset A`" if and only if A contains B. 

Language does not seem possible without admitting that it's nature is inextricably tied to the phenomenon of naming, and naming is not a coherent phenomenon unless language is allowed an infinite regress, forever synthesizing names and names of names and names of names of names and ...

    Where but to think is to be full of sorrow.

    -- `Ode to a Nightingale`_, John Keats

My thoughts are an endless circle. They always return to the point where they started, never having gained any further insight, never having accomplished anything. The same questions remain, except more complex and daunting for the depths that have been revealed. The same thoughts repeat and repeat, each time more muddled and lacking even more clarity. The recursion never ceases.

The :ref:`world <world>` is an ocean of contradiction upon contradiction, absurdity upon absurdity. It is a never-ending deluge of senselessness, a flood of utter desolation, tidal in its pull. It sinks all meaning beneath its surface. No structure remains standing in its wake. 

The world will defy every expectation, slip every knot and dissolve in front of your eyes. Give it a name and it will immediately exceed that name, for now the totality of the world is now what was plus what has been named. :ref:`Being <being>` refuses to be abstracted out of the :ref:`world <world>`, for the abstraction cannot help but become part of the :ref:`world <world>`. 

How could it be otherwise? Would the questions have meaning if their answers were immediately rendered simply by asking? If our lives are to have meaning, unassailable in its foundations, then the :ref:`world <world>` ipso facto must be inexplicable. If the :ref:`world <world>` meant anything beyond the meaning we give it, then the meaning we find in the :ref:`world <world>` would not be ours. But all meaning we find is by necessity *ours*, for it is impossible that a thought we think should be otherwise.

Those who question or outright deny the validity of faith often do so incorrectly. The argument of the atheist almost invariably reduces to: why is there suffering? This, however, is no argument at all, for it is riddled with unspoken assumptions and fallacies, such as assuming a divine nature must comport to human morality or that suffering serves no purpose. 

To truly make the atheistic argument, one must understand what is meant by *faith*. One cannot argue in *good faith* against something they do not understand, so the true atheist must seek what the believer finds in the before the altar in order to demonstrate why it is not so. 

The nature of faith is mostly precisely comprehended in Hume's division of causality into necessity and sufficiency. The meaning of this statement is not immediately obvious and will require elaboration of these terms, "*necessity*" and "*sufficiency*". Afer Hume, these notions would later be formalized more precisely into the logical notion of equivalence, which also provides a visual and symbolic cue for understanding the exact meaning. Therefore, the meaning of these terms will be most easily approached by unpacking their formal definitions. Formally, *sufficiency* can be defined as,

    **Sufficiency** :math:`p \implies q` : :math:`p` is sufficent for :math:`q`. 

If :math:`q` is known, then :math:`p` is also known. However, a logical implication does not imply a material implication. It may be the case :math:`p` is false and :math:`q` is true. Knowing :math:`p` has *not* occurred is not *sufficient* for knowing :math:`q` has *not* occurred. In other words, *sufficiency* is positive knowledge. Knowing :math:`p` is true yields a deduction, but knowing :math:`p` is false provides nothing. This is what is meant by *sufficiency*.

For example, if one knows it is raining, that implies it is cloudy. But knowing it is cloudy does not imply it is raining. Therefore, the knowledge that it is raining is sufficient, but not necessary, for the knowledge that it is cloudy. 

    **Necessity** :math:`\neg p \implies \neg q`: :math:`p` is necessary for :math:`q`.

By contrast, *necessity* is negative knowledge. If an implication is *necessary*, the knowledge its consequence is false immediately leads to the knowledge its hypothesis is false. This is often reexpressed using the law of contraposition (i.e. :math:`q \implies p`), but this conversion into a positive expression hides the essential *negative* nature of necessity. Knowledge of necessity arises by observing the non-occurence of two events. 

One must be careful in the interpretation of these concepts, necessity and sufficiency. They should be understood in a Bayesian sense, insofar that the relation of implication between :math:`p` and :math:`q` is never known :ref:`a priori <a-priori>` and can only be established through observation. This point is important, yet extremely subtle so it bears closer analysis.

Furthermore, one must keep in mind the formal defintions of these terms are *syntactical* in nature. They express the *form* any causal relation must satisfy in :ref:`language <language>`, but they are silent on the content thus expressed. For example, the following propositions satisfy the formal definitions given above,

.. math::

    p = \text{"the net force on the mass is non-zero"}

    q = \text{"the acceleration of the mass is non-zero"}

If we know a mass is accelerating, then we know the net force acting on it is non-zero (*sufficiency*). If the net-force on a mass is zero, then we know its acceleration is also zero (*necessity*). Therefore, we conclude the force on a mass is necessary and sufficient for knowing the fact of its acceleration. Furthermore, while we may not be able to say precisely which is the cause of the other, it is nevertheless clear the relationship between these two descriptions can be labeled "*causal*", meaning the knowledge of one event meaningfully affects the knowledge of the other event. 

However, unfortunately, the formal definitions of sufficiency and necessity do not exclude *non-causal* relations from their satisfaction. For example, these propositions also satisfy the definition, 

.. math::

    p = \text{"the length measures one foot"}

    q = \text{"the length measures twelve inches"}

As another example,

.. math::

    p = \text{"the color is red or not red"}

    q = \text{"the color is never both red and not red"}

In both cases, one would hardly say :math:`p` is the *cause* of :math:`q`, or visa versa. In other words, syntax alone is unable to determine which propositions constitute expressions of *causal* relations, for causality does not reside within the domain of formalism. The root of the causal problem lies in the insurmountable tension between intension and extension; this tension can be seen by noting the implication "*if 2 + 2 = 5, then Paris is the capital of France*" is a logically true proposition, and yet offers no meaningful knowledge for consumpation. Syntax (logic) can partition along the dimensions of *possible* and *coherent*, but is incapable of partitioning along the dimensions of *actual* and *meaningful*, except insofar that what is *actual* must also be *possible* and what is *meaningful* must also be *coherent*.

The problem of *faith* cast into the :ref:`language <language>` of necessity and sufficiency is thus: God is sufficient for existence, but not necessarily necessary. Thus, the concept of God cannot be comprehended syntactically (logically) as a *cause* unless one consents to the clause: God is necessary for existence. 

The crux of faith, the essential leap into the unknown, boils down to whether one can imagine a world without God and whether doubts in the affirmative direction can be exorcised from the mind.

Mathematically, if :math:`α[i]` stands for the i:sup:`th` character in word :math:`α`, then a reflective word is defined as the words which satisfy the relation :math:`α[i] = α[c(α)-i-1]`. For example, ``nun`` is a reflective word.

    The symbol :math:`M_\mathfrak{s}` refers to the set of all words that satisfy the syllabic pattern :math:`\mathfrak{s}`, where :math:`\mathfrak{s}` is a concatenated sequence of syllabic stresses such that ``+`` means stressed and ``-`` means unstressed. For example, :math:`M_{-+}` refers to the set of all iambic words.

Note :math:`R, M_{-+} \subset L`, i.e. both sets are subsets of a language :math:`L`. A linguistically true statement that cannot be formally proven: 

.. math::

    \mid R \mid \leq \mid M_{-+} \mid

In other words,

    There are more iambic words in a language than there are reflective words. 

Where the language :math:`L` is understood to be a stress-timed language.

The issue lies in how membership is determined. In the case of reflective words, the membership constraint is purely syntactic, whereas in the case of iambic words, the membership constraint is purely phonetic. Phonetics does not possess syntactic rules, in the sense that one cannot uniquely determine a phonetic pronouncation from the inscription of the word alone. For example, "*concord*" may be pronounced "*con-CORD*" or "*CON-cord*" depending on the context in which "*concord*" is embedded.

Here is a fact whose entire essence is :ref:`a posteriori <a-posteriori>`. It is not *necessary* for there to be more iambic words than reflective words in a given language. There is no *reason* for the two quantities to bear any sort of relation, except through sheer coincidence or accident. The direction of the relation cannot be proven, if by "*proven*" it is meant a logical argument that shows how, starting with the definition of reflective words and the definition of iambic words, their relative cardinality can be established. In other words, there is no formal deduction that links these two concepts together. The claim of their relative cardinality can only be understood by appeal to a dictionary and empirical evidence.

This example shows :ref:`language <language>` possesses mutually independent dimensions, where scaling along one dimension need not affect how the language is expressed in another dimension. Furthermore, from this it follows a string from a :ref:`language <language>` inherently possesses several dimensions of length. 

As an example of the preceding, consider the sentence,

    deduce the theorem now.

In terms of purely transcriptional dimensions, this sentence has a character length of 22 (including delimiters) and a word length of 4. Given the :ref:`correct axiomatization <section-ii-ii>` of :ref:`language <language>`, it can be shown the character length of a string is bounded from below by the string's word length, i.e. since every word must contain atleast one character, there must always be more characters in a sentence than words. This is an example of the sort of relative cardinalities that can be established when two concepts are categorically related.

However, the sentence may also be parsed along a phonetic dimension,

    de-DUCE the THEO-rem NOW

Which makes clear this sentence has a stressed syllable length of 3 and an unstressed syllable length of 3, leading to a total syllable count of 6. 

The following sentences have the same measurements,

    a dream awaits tonight / a DREAM a-WAITS to-NIGHT

    the stars above appear / the STARS a-BOVE a-PPEAR

    no path betrays escape / no PATH be-TRAYS es-CAPE

However, one can alter the character length and word length while leaving the syllabic lengths unaltered, as in, 

    the wolf with sharpened claws / the WOLF with SHARP-ened CLAWS

Which has a character length of 29, a word length of 5 and a syllable length of 6. Note that syllable length is bounded from below by the word length for the same reason as character length. Similarly, since every syllable must contain at least one character, the character length is always bounded from below by syllable length. Letting :math:`s(x)` represent the syllable length of a string :math:`x`, the hierarchy of linguistic lengths is given as, 

.. math::

    w(x) \leq s(x) \leq c(x)

It is important to realize both :math:`M_{-+}` and :math:`R` are formally well-defined. Given a word, the conditions for its membership into either set can be precisely specified and determined. However, the sets exist in different domains of discourse. The properties which determine inclusion in one set do not (directly) affect the properties which determine inclusion in the other set. To say the same thing a different way, the predicates of "*words*" have different modes. 

One wants to say here: To know a word is iambic gives you no information whatsoever about whether or not it is reflective. Or to put it in conditional probabilistic terms: if one selects a random word from a corpus, the probability of it being iambic given no information about its syntactic structure is equal to the probability of it being iambic given the fact it is reflective.

However, this is not true. Indeed, while there is no *formal* argument that leads to the conclusion there are more iambic words than reflective, there is a *statistically* :ref:`a priori <a-priori>` argument that does not require direct observation of a corpus to demonstrate there is a compelling reason to believe that any language that contains enough words will almost assuredly contain more iambic words than reflective words. 

The motivation for this argument can be seen by noting that an overwhelming amount of reflective word are monosyllabic, e.g. *eye*, *aha*, *nun*, *bob*, *pip*, *tot*, *sis*, *wow*, *sees*, *noon*, *stats*, etc. As the number of syllables in a word increases, the frequency of reflectivity decreases. A heuristic argument can be formulated along the following lines:

- For an alphabet with N characters (including delimiters) and a word with :math:`M` characters, there are potentially :math:`N^M` possible word-forms to use. 
- Out of these :math:`N^M` word-forms, (using combinatorial arguments), there are :math:`N^{\lceil M/2 \rceil}` possible reflective word-forms. 

Consider selecting a random word with :math:`M` characters. If the event of each character selection is treated as independent and identically distributed, then the probability of selecting a reflective word with :math:`M` characters is approximately, 

.. math::

    P(R) = \frac{N^{\lceil M/2 \rceil}}{N^M} = \frac{1}{N^{\lfloor M/2 \rfloor}}


This shows, as the number of characters in a word increases, the probability of it being reflective drops exponentially. In other words, there is a combinatorial reason for reflective words occuring more frequently within the intersection of monosyllabic words. Monosyllabic words, by their nature, cannot be iambic. Moreover, monosyllabic words are finite, if it assumed every language has some upper bound for its syllabic lengths, e.g. the longest syllable in English is typically cited as 9 ("scrunched"). Once the monosyllabic words of a language have been assigned meanings, the possibility of randomly generating new reflective words diminishes rapidly. Therefore, as the number of words in a language increases, the probability of :math:`P(R | M_{-+})` decreases.
