Cumberland
----------

Bay silt in city stone through time accrues
along the western course of concrete flow
that sweeps from plain to sky in upward spews
as grey-white spray arcs over wave to snow
from heights on high and splash on mountain spine
where valleyed pools in rising drink their fill
and shoot with sprouts through shoulders made of pine
the roofs that empty crowds on streets and spill
through hand to hand the layers stacked from base
to wedded brick til building lillies bred
against the westward wall in flood's embrace
where lips at last are wet in watershed;

Let skyline mark where tide in climb was broke:
Steeple, roof, needles pine and leaves of oak.


Walls
-----

the husk of walls that city shucks
accumulates and concentrates
around like rings in ancient trunks
where measured age with circle gates
the spiraled line amassed through time,
deposits buried down substrates.

at summit's crest, the joints are thick
and licking tongues of moss ascend
the darkened blocks from quarry hauled
on buttressed back, in stone suspend
the garden court where crowds took root
and grew their plans of walls to tend.

from center peak the wooden slats
erect the map with tangled fence
to trace a grid of patchwork yards,
these charts of dreams in ground commence
the flattened course of borough life
where burgs and burbs did once condense.

then moving out, the bricks of red
in crooked rows descend to meet
the lanes of carriage tracts now black
and scorched with tar in shapes of street
where crimson dust from crumbled walls
in dancing twirls across concrete.

next grey cement of molded squares
in towers stacked to portal sky
with wires fused and humming signs;
they arc and rise, on edges vie
the vines entwined in rushing growth
to split on spine, like nuclei.

at last the stable struts of steel
designed as straight as rays of light
reflected back on silver glass
the lattice links both left and right;
the history in circled sweep
constricts the city sphere so tight.

through sections cross the avenue
from point to point and time to time
the human shell that forms in turn
the arches bend, the steepled chime,
that wilts and sheds, but fossils kept
in barrows born their salt and lime.

Landscapes
----------

Oh, hapless world, the butcher's block,
  The sickle, scythe, harpoon,
The barren fields, the culled livestock,
  The blood red harvest moon.

The ocean deep, a darkened heart,
  A sore that festers cold,
A slumbered age, a violent art,
  Into all things behold.

The forests wild, the stalking hunt,
  The arrow cut from stone,
The bloody rib, the brutal grunt,
   A death in whimpered groan.

The mountain peaks, a falling height,
   The air in sky dissolved,
A winter wind, a bitter blight,
  Let no sin be absolved.

The city streets, the graveyard paths,
  The linen beds of wards,
The gowns of white, the final baths,
  The oak in coffin boards.

The Curse of Rain
-----------------

| The rainy days, so slandered, weep
| As haughty summer lovers lay
| And mock the sky with lazy sleep,
| While clouds so white with dreams of gray,
| With sun they soak and whirling sweep
| In hidden furies' winded spray.
|
| Each time it rains, the rivers splay,
| And surge with purging currents swift,
| What lays on shore is swept away
| Through undertow then set adrift
| To reach again where edge gives way
| To core laid bare through ancient rift.
|
| The heat was shaped with holy bliss,
| While cold finds form in shattered fall,
| The tracks of arcs that never miss,
| The purpose found in roaring squall,
| To hurl in spite of stolen kiss,
| To seed with life this earthen sprawl.
|
| No forest sprite nor sun born sprout,
| Can know the course of water's fate,
| To craft and make then cease the drought,
| And hear its name with venom hate
| In curses made by summer's clout,
| And so it cries at heaven's gate.

Autumn
------

| Oh! If I could touch an inch of Autumn
|       And measure Fall in feet,
| I might scale its depths to chart the bottom
|       And feel the Winter heat.
| Alas, no meters mark by foot the path
|       Through wooded maze of trees
|           Where leaves like life will wilt
|               In winded wake of wrath
|           In gusts blown cruel and dumb
|        To lay at feet to span each foot
| The dust each clever leaf here does become.
|
| As seasons pass and cast
|       My bone layered into stone,
| Let August dig for me a grave in brown
|       Barrow beneath her loam.
| Pray not a lover find these shards on shore
|       I am no edge to skip
|           Atop the waves of fancy
|               But under weight sunk roar
|           Where, offset, tides will rise
|       To breach the sodden dike
| And drown with wave the lazing lovers' sigh.
|
| To life I came already old and grim
|           But now the chill sets in;
| Each breath in gasp dispels to steam
|           of Spring now waning thin.
