It is impossible to symbolize the actual motions of thought. Consider the argument, "it is asserted '*p*', it is asserted '*p implies q*', therefore '*q*',". It may be rendered symbolically using the assertion sign :math:`\vdash` and the conclusion sign :math:`\therefore`,

    \vdash p

    \vdash p \implies q
    
    \therefore q

The law of *modus ponens* is a primitive notion in logic [#april_2014_01]_ and it must be accepted at face value in order to go any further. If one asks why this law is so, there can be no explanation. It is simply the case and one must be satisfied at that. There is no greater ballast upon which to rest the truth of this proposition. The reason cannot be captured in symbols; the symbols which express *modus ponens* can only stand and present the meaning for an attentive mind to decipher. If it is not accepted, the possibility of communication has ceased.

Here is a problem no computer will ever solve: Select a random number between 0 and infinity [#april_2014_02]_. 

.. [#april_2014_01] There are other decompositions of logic that take as primitive other modes of inference besides *modus ponens*, but the essential idea here is that logic requires a "*starting point*". Logic must start with a premise. Either one accepts that premise as "*true*" or they do not, and in the latter case there is no further recourse except to point and say, "see?". -- April 2025

.. [#april_2014_02] The exact same problem can be restated in simpler terms: Select a random number between 0 and 1. In fact, the endpoints make no difference.

All such problems form a class of problems no computer built on binary logic will ever solve. -- April 2025

If the lessons of statistics and the scientific method have been adequately learned then it is not hard to conclude absolute truth is an impossibility. Absolute falsity is easily established by counter-example, but absolute truth remains beyond the realms of inference. We merely glimpse the outlines of truth in what it has been shown not to be. 

If the lessons of logic and set theory have been adequately learned, then it also follows readily that total truth is an impossibility, which is to say, assuming one can even grasp a single truth, it is impossible to enumerate all of the things which are true. Certain propositions are always beyond the pale. 

Against this backdrop of utter uncertaint,y it then remains a question whether truth is derivative of the human condition. That is, whether a thing can be true or not in the absence of humans, or if truth is a uniquely human abstraction without application in a world without humans. We might surmise a thing, whatever that thing might be qualified as (a table, a tree, a particle), is either in a location or it is not (relative to a frame of reference [#may_2015_01]_ ), so that we might conclude if truth is not inherent in the universe, then at least an analog of truth presents itself in the binary state of any point in the universe either being filled by a thing or not. It is then not much of a leap to suggest a mapping of truth onto this mechanical aspect of the universe as the binding which gives rise to the human notion of truth.

But then we consider our best attempts as a species at understanding the universe around us and come up against the Uncertainty Principle: that a thing does not have location until it is observed, and that location is an event of chance. In other words, it is impossible to say where a thing is exactly before observing it, only it's probable location. If a thing can not be identified with a position :ref:`a priori <a-priori-a-posteriori>`, that is to say if location cannot in some respect determine a thing, then we have a problem. This is not the problem of continuity that puzzled mathematicians and physicists at the turn of the twentieht century; for a problem of continuity is merely a question as to the particular description of the universe, how it is that things are. This is a problem of epistemology: we have here a crack in the foundation of classical truth.

Truth cannot in any way be identified as spatial; truth is not part of the physical order of things. If location is not a judgeable property of a thing beforehand, as demonstrated by the Uncertainty Principle, then the concept of truth does not spring from the locomotion of a thing from one place to another, as truth is not conditional on observation (does a proposition need to be observed to be true? Or is its truth value inherently bound to its form? [#may_2015_02]_); In an uncertain world, truth is no longer bound to presence in the physical world. Each point in space cannot be thought of as binary trigger, denoting occupation or not. There is no (direct) map between the motion of the universe and the logic of truth. 

This is an important point, as the basis of all modern computing depends on the notion of location containing information. A transistor either has a positive or negative voltage. That is, electrons flow in one direction or the other through the transistor. The transistor contains things. In this way, we are able to map the state of things in a transistor to logical statements: a transistor contains this and that thing, a transistor contains this or that thing, a transistor does not contain that thing.

We see in this model how our notion of truth as it exists today is interwoven with presence in space. We must at the same time admit the great power of this model, as it has completely transformed human life. By identifying truth with location, we have undergone successive revolutions in information. But if it is not fundamentally possible for location to contain information, given the nature of the laws of physics and the properties of truth so far discussed, we must question what is really going on here.

Perhaps it is the case that information and truth are not so closely linked as previously thought. Can information exist that is not true? Certainly, at a human level, it is possible to say things such as, "*the purple cow gave an eloquent speech on the motorway*". But, on a more fundamental level, is it possible for the universe to *lie*? Can a structure of things in existence refer to something that is not? It seems a silly proposition, but why? Because a thing is a thing, and it can only indicate itself, one might reply. But how does a thing indicate? Doesn't the notion of indication imply a thing becoming that which it is not? A street sign indicates an abstract instruction, but this is an artifice deployed in a human world. What does a flower indicate? Can an object that is not constructed to have meaning a priori by an intelligent being have the same kind of meaning as the constructions? Or is the meaning of a street sign bound in some way to its use in the human world?

The knowledge a being has of itself is by necessity incomplete, since its knowledge will necessarily involve reference to itself as the bearer of said knowledge (the knowledge you have implicitly contains the knowledge you have this knowledge) and in trying to encapsulate the sum total of its knowledge, it will also try to encapsulate itself within that framework, triggering fractal feedback. Being is in this respect effervescent; knowing is a process that cannot be completed. When the human mind tries to understand itself, it faces the disintegration of the subject into its constituent objects. If the subject is the object of attention, this disintegration reveals the subject is not contained in the inspected objects. A subject is known through objects, because objects can have meaning that is not part of their presence in physical space; objects can indicate some other than themselves, they can be symptoms of a phenomenon that does not have physicality in the scientific sense.

In the field of physics, energy was originally a derived concept, a byproduct of forces acting on objects. Specifically, energy was defined when the forces in a system could be represented as functions of distance and time, as a known and determinate ensemble applied to an object. The forces that propel objects in space and time can then be analyzed mathematically, with a calculus of symbols. A mathematical quantity of interest, defined as energy, is the force applied to an
object over a certain distance. The calculated quantity exists independently of the specifics of the scenario under consideration, insofar as it is unconcerned with directions and dimensionality. It is a measurement of work done *by* a system, not of *how* that work was done. Lagrange and Hamilton inverted this conception by positing energy as the fundamental quantity and motion as being derived from its optimal consumption. Instead of energy arising from motion, motion was a consequence of energy expenditure. This subtle reversal uncovered a mathematical formulation that many view as more fundamental since it seems to express a "*truth*" about nature. 

The world of Newtonian mechanics prior to the work of Lagrange and Hamilton was a world of subjective calculation; a point of view was taken in the system, a coordinate system defined, forces broken down into components and arranged relative to the observer's frame of reference. Energy was then deduced and calculated from the observer's point of view; The subject was presupposed. 

In the Lagrangian formulation, the coordinate systems for objects are ancillary and secondary. There is no inherent point of view taken with respect to the orientation of the system until after its energy distribution is defined. The observer in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics is a secondary concept, that only serves the spatialize the invariant quantity of energy across its modes of perception. In other words, Lagrange and Hamilton succeeded in uncovering a principle of total objectification. Within in their framework, suddenly everything becomes a consequence of a first and ultimate principle, a possible theorem from a complete set of physical law.

Within the geometry of our solution to the energy expenditure problem, there exists a revolting chaos, a fractal reference. By becoming aware of our boundaries, we have slipped into an altogether unpleasant infinity. We are perhaps not the only species on this planet to exhibit self-awareness, but we are by far the most complex. Our solution to being is such that we have internalized our being in the network of relations that defines our point of view in the struggle for existence. We perceive ourselves as objects that die, that fall out of existence. The subatomic particle has no faculty for internalization, it is itself and nothing more. It is the most basic expenditure of energy. Our form of expenditure is built out of a lattice of energy differentials transforming through time; our nature is such that we have come to sit atop the struggle and watch it unfold, altering its course through the interference of choice. We perceive that we are bound by forces that continually diminuish our being, that tug at our extremities, pulling us back into kinetic ether. Our fundamental transcendence, the one that demarcates our boundaries in the geometry of space, is that turning away from dissolution, that wrenching away from death, from nonbeing. 

But the horizon of death is inevitable. Everything ends. Death is built into the system. Any possible creature must have death built into its framework of life, as the nether region that its being negates via energy expenditure. If artificial intelligence is possible (as it clearly seems to be; humans themselves are but programs constructed via distillation through the struggle for being.), then its fundamental nature, though perhaps alien and unutterable to ourselves in its particulars, has to be that of perceiving its own death. By physical instantiation in the universe, its being would be predicated upon its location in space and it would perceive itself a temporal being. The realization of temporality is none other than the perception of death, because if you are here now, who is to say you will be here the next moment? Not you, because if you knew, you would already be there or have been there, in that moment, in possession of that knowledge. You can only know if you are or have been, never if you will be. Death is always a future possibility. To be an intelligence is to know that one can just as well not be. Even if the intelligence could be sustained indefinitely via electrical energy, this is by no means a way of achieving immortality; it would nonetheless perceive its impermanence, just as we do; it would know that its physicality is predicated on demarcation in space and all boundaries are subject to dissolution through the intangible process of time; everything perishes, at least potentially.

The inherent paradox of self-awareness is connected to our fear of death; It does not make sense that being should know it is being; from our very nature, that of repetition, the thought is repellant: an organized solution to the energy-work problem that is of aware of itself, that can act seemingly at random, so much so that passion, a term without scientific connotation, is the only explanation. We cannot envision such a mechanism unfolding; we only visualize the specifics of its procedures, look for its understanding in the principles of work; we are never able to hold the whole of its solution in mind because the solution exceeds itself. We cannot imagine the self-awareness of another because by doing so we have already taken a point of view, that of ourselves. Our form of representation is our point of view. The very fact we take a point of view at all precludes our ever experiencing another point of view.

The true nature of :ref:`being <being>` can be seen in its extremities, when it forced in an unsustainable mode. This is most apparent in experiences of great pain or ecstasy, when the self drains away, abstraction melts into concrete reality and we are left with the raw sensous impressions of experience itself; in these moments, the world narrows down to the immediate, to what is directly at hand and readily apparent in our senses. One need only attempt a calculus problem after shattering a femur to attest to the truth of this; It is only with tremendous effort the self can be reclaimed in moments such as these, and it is these stories we make legend, for resisting temptation in pursuit of a higher goal or ceasing to die in the face of death until your purpose is fulfilled are the highest marks a :ref:`being <being>` can attain. These themes speak to us because they return us to a primordial state, before considerations of consciousness crowd out all others, and show what the self really is: a struggle to sustain itself despite the incessant efforts of nature it to its primary state of :ref:`nothingness <nothing>`.

We are asking if the conjugation of "*am*" deserves recognition as an ontological operation over and above the existential operation of "*is*" which structures language. We are asking if it is a redundancy that is already included in "*is*", merely a syntactical construct with no semantic interpretation. 

If the first case obtains, "*am*" provides structure distinct from the structure of the "*is*", essentially performing the function of dimensionalizing language, and the question "*what am I?*" has been granted a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a meaningful answer. If the latter case obtains, then the answer we seek is clearly some variation of "*I am* :ref:`nothing <nothing>`.

---

In modern English, :ref:`being <being>` is the marriage of two concepts that were previously distinct. Its etymology descends from the coupling of the Old English words "`beon <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/beon>`_" and "`wesan <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wesan>`_", which can in turn be, if the theorists are to be believed, traced further back to the Proto-Indo-European roots of "*bheu*" and "*wes*", respectively. For this reason, we conjugate from the infinitive "*to be*"" two distinct varieties of words:

1. **B**-root words: *be*, *been* and *being*
2. **W**-root words: *was*, *were*. 

"*Is*", a direct cognate from Old English, is the present tense conjugation of "*wesan*", revealing its hereditary from the *es*-stem roots that form the concept of :ref:`being <being>` in other Proto-Indo-European languages, such as the Spanish "*estar*" or the Italian "*essere*", and thus belongs to the latter group of conjugated verbs.  

It is in the meaning of these words prior to their symbosis we find a starting point for understanding the separation of "*am*" and "*is*". The differences between the semantic function of "*beon*" and "*wesan*" is slight, but potent.

"*Wesan*" is the Being of objects and nouns. It is the "*is*" of the "*this*" and "*that*", the "*the*" and the "*a*". When affixed to a name, "*wesan*" indicates existence, what is actual about its subject. "*He is here*", "*you will be arriving soon*", "*there are three of them*". These are all existential statements of particular cases, facts which can be determined true or false by reference to reality. This type of concrete Being is contained in "*Wesan*". 

    **wæron** þa dura belocene (the doors **were** closed)

    Her **wearð** Eadwine cing ofslagen (Here King Edward **was** slain)
 
To put it succinctly, "*Wesan*" is the empirical "*is*", the "*is*" which refers to the external world. 

"*Beon*", however, is the :ref:`being <being>` of the abstraction and adjectives. "*Beon*" indicates an object's [gnomic aspect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomic_aspect). In the parlance of logic, a *gnomic* truth is a universal assertion, a statement of generality that applies to all things of which it speaks. While the Being of modern English does not have a direct *gnomic* form, a *gnomic* proposition can be induced by the removal of the particularizing article "*the*" in the following: *the birds are fast*. The use of  "*the* in this sentence refers to a particular group of birds, whereas the proposition "*birds are fast*" does not refer to any definite bird, but references the *gnomic aspect* of birds, i.e. the abstraction of form common to all avian entities. It is in this context that "*beon*" is conjugated in Old English.

    Ic beo gearo sona (I **will be** ready soon)

    Wiga biþ strang (Warriors **are** strong)

Mandarin has a similar variation in how it unpacks the relations of Being into representative form. In Mandarin, the verb "*是 (shi)*" can only be affixed to nouns, to signs representing physical objects,

    wǒ **shì** lǎoshī (You are a teacher)

However, "*是 (shi)*" cannot be affixed to adjectives, such as beautiful or loyal. For that, the extra verb "*很 (hen)*" is required,

    Nǐ **hěn** cōngming (You are smart) 

Again in  "*是 (shi)*" and "*很 (hen)*"  the distinction of meaning found in "*wesan*" and "*beon*" is encountered, that of actuality versus abstraction. Indeed, this is a common duality to be found in languages across the world. 

When "*wesan*" and "*beon*" were gradually merged in modern English, two meanings came to inhabit the same word. Still, to this day, these meanings have not yet been fully integrated, perhaps due to their mutual exclusion. There are defects in the merger that can be glimpsed, when words falter slightly in their aspect and :ref:`being <being>` reveals its separate meanings. The English :ref:`being <being>` haphazardly applies the ideas of concrete and abstract reality simultaneously, thereby allowing assertions of existence to be mixed with assertions of conceptualization, as seen in the propositions "*there is love*", "*this is justice*", "*hope is eternal*", etc. The English "*is*"" is capable of asserting abstracted existence, i.e. existence that is not reducible to objective reality.

The lack of precision in discussions of :ref:`being <being>` often leads to the participants overlooking this subtle distinction between the two notions. Indeed, the course of western philosophy depended throughout most of its history on the unexamined assumption these two types of :ref:`being <being>` were essentially the same, that is to say, that both "*am*" and "*is*" imply existence in the same way. 

This necessarily leads to a duality of mind and body; if the primary mode of :ref:`being <being>` of both "*am*" and "*is*" is existential, then there must be a rupture in :ref:`being <being>`; things must divide into "*res extensa*" (literally: "*the thing which is extended*"), and into "*res cogitans*", (literally: "*the thing which thinks*"). In other words, :ref:`being <being>` is necessarily split into the physical and the mental because the "*am*" and "*is*" are both derivative of *existence*.

While Newton was in England developing his three laws from which he would deduce a broad array of :ref:`phenomenon <phenomena>`, such as planetary motion, geometric optics, etc., work was being done in continential Europe to express physical law in terms of an extremum principle. Rather than asserting the three laws of the motion as the primitives of mechanics, Hamilton and Lagrange showed these laws were the result of a more fundamental principle, that of *least action*:

.. admonition:: Principle of Least Action 

    The trajectory of a particle between two fixed points in time is such that it extremizes the quantity of *action*. 

Where *action* is defined as the difference between the potential and kinetic energy in a system integrated over the time period in consideration, i.e. the accumulated excess energy over and above what is proscribed by the system itself. By asserting motion is such that it minimizes this quantity, Newton's laws naturally fall out of the mathematical conversation of energy.

By positing the laws of motions thus, Hamilton and Lagrange displayed a formulation which represents the world as the intersection of all possibilities. It is as if the universe looked at all the possible lines that connected two points and brought into existence only the single one which satisfied the conditions of necessity.

Except when we say "*universe*" in the preceding, we should be careful, for what we truly mean is the apprehensions of the subject apprehending, the :ref:`Being <being>` that reflects on its Being.

The great workhorse of mathematics is proof by contradiction. An assumption is made, an absurdity is shown to result from the assumption, therefore the assumption is shown to be false. In this way was modern mathematics constructed, by outlining the truth and demarcating its boundary with falsity. Anyone who has studied higher mathematics will attest to the way most mathematical proofs work by letting the truth "`in through the back door <world-as-will-and-representation>`_", that is to say, they work by showing what cannot be the case in order to prove the opposite must be so, but this gets us no closer to *why* it is so.

This method does not reveal the *intuition*  the theorem to the observer; indeed one can comprehend a proof without understanding anything about what it trying to say and in the converse direction, one may understand a concept without being able to grasp its proof in the slightest.

So it is with induction: the proof of induction, and therefore every proof *by* induction, relies on a contradiction that an element belongs to two mutually exclusive sets, which we are forced to admit is absurdity, therefore we conclude induction must be true; but nowhere in the proof do we see why the form in an induced series is transmitted from one term to the next. Likewise, a student can spend an entire academic career studying the axioms and theorems of real analysis and still have no intuition for how a falling stone's trajectory traces a parabola with respect to time, despite having memorized a series of proofs that show how to go from set theory to differential calculus.

No doubt the advance of machine learning and artifical intelligence has helped mislead philosophy back into the rationalist trap in which it has so often found itself stuck throughout history. The results of these fields are staggering and alluring, as if everything we are might be reduced to the mechanical equations of a machine, as if consciousness and being were contained in the regression coefficient matrices underlying machine learning, and not *their application over time and space*. 

It seems likely that we will, in the near future, have an algorithm capable of producing a process that yields digital sentience, but we must be careful to understand the implications of such an algorithm. It will not be the symbols themselves that offer up another soul to the universal meat grinder, but the utter incomprehensibility of its results uninterprettable without the presupposition of consciousness that will give rise to a digital being. We should not expect to find the meaning of the algorithm, and therefore digital consciousness, in the instructions used to construct the model, but in the actual conceptualizations formed by the model.

:ref:`Frege <frege>` uncovers an interesting contingency in the logical form in his definitions of primitive Number. In modern symbolism, he is defining 0 and 1 respectively in terms of the cardinality of sets, i.e. in terms of the enumeration of objects, 

.. math::

    A = \{ x \mid x \neq x \} 

.. math::

    n(A) = 0 

Zero is defined as the cardinality of a contradictory set. Logic, as it were, has an opinion of itself, namely that its contradictions are empty. This, however, requires the symbolism to express the contradictions that must contain nothing via the contingency of their form.

Furthermore, the subsequent form of numbers can be expressed via recursion back to this original proposition about the cardinality of contradictions.

.. math::
    
    B = \{ y \mid y = n(A) \}

.. math::
    
    n(B) = 1

Take note, the form of the contradiction is irrrelevant. We could as well define zero as the cardinality of the negation of the excluded middle, but there is nevertheless an inherent property to any form we substitute into the :ref:`Fregean definition of zero <frege-zero>`: the expression will always involve an indeterminate x and a relation that cannot possibly result in a judgement of truth even in its indeterminacy, exemplified in :ref:`Frege <frege>`'s case as the inabilty of thing to not be itself. The foundation of Frege's arithmetic philosophy rests on the ontological equivalence of contradiction and nullity.

It must have been surprising to the first :ref:`being <being>` who recognized in language the image of the world. One is tempted to posit that exact moment as the historical origin of sentience. Akin to a photograph or a painting, a sentence is a reflection of :ref:`being <being>`; even when a painting depicts a fiction, it stil does so through the dimensions of necessity, through color and perspective, through representation; the same can be said of a sentence, for when we sketch the image of a paritcular :ref:`being <being>` in a proposition such as "*the pencil is over there*", we have, with words, captured the essential relationship embodied by an existent entity that is before us. We have "*photographed*" :ref:`being <being>` in words, reduced its momentary effervescence to a reproducible formulation.

Consider the etymological link between *passion* and *passive*. In the first reading, one might make the mistake of assuming a polarity between these terms, that is to say, a diametrical opposition. The former is a driving force whereas the latter is the lack of a driving force.

However, both emerge from a common Latin root of *passio*: to endure. That which is passive endures any state impressed upon it, while that which is passionate endures (perhaps unwillingly) the burden of seizure, of complete domination by an external source. In both cases, there is a commonality: the removal of the subject. The subject in a passive state is the same as a subject in a passionate state, which is null and void. In neither case is there a conscious decision to be made; instead one surrenders themselves to an unknown sovereignty; unknown because consciousness relinquishes its ability to care; sovereign because it is the determinate factor in the outcome that proceeds from said state.

Death removes all possibility of absolute certainty.

To see this, we need only note that not only is it the case that it cannot be known whether after death [#november_2022_01]_ there is an afterlife, :ref:`nothing <nothing>`, an awareness without experience, or even a perpetual waking into another reality, these events cannot even be assigned probabilities in any real sense of the term. What would a probability outside the domain of immediate experience *mean*? 

Uncertainty is a state of incompleteness, where knowledge cannot be attained because it is separated from :ref:`being <being>` by a layer of possibility. We do not know if the world outside of ourselves exists as it appears to us, for it is always a possibility that we are a brain in a vat, subject to the mind probes of a **Cartesian** demon.

A possibiilty is a type of a quantity that transmits uncertainty to reality by :ref:`being <being>` possible. In this sense, possibility and probability are synonyms. Just as all :ref:`probabilities <probability>` must sum to one, all possibilities must converge towards :ref:`being <being>`. 

The isomorphism is nearly perfect: the distribution of an event's :ref:`probability <probability>` cannot be known without previous measurement so that before an event occurs any prior assumption about its nature can only be a completely random guess; Moreover, our knowledge of the distribution can only approach towards its true shape asymptotically as we accumulate a larger and larger sample, never actually transcending uncertainty (*cie la vie*, :ref:`Cantor <cantor>`...). 

In the same way, a possibility can only be known after the fact. It is entirely impossible [#november_2022_02]_ to know whether a possibility is possible until it already happened. A possibility is characterized as something that could obtain, but to know whether it could obtain, one must know it has already been obtained. [#november_2022_03]_ 

Moreover, whatever :ref:`being <being>` may be, it is only what it is insofar that it is possible it might not be what it is, i.e. you might be reading these words in a dream.

What happens outside of our :ref:`being <being>` in the :ref:`world <world>` is not possible, because to be possible means, first and foremost, the possibility of coming to :ref:`be <being>` in the :ref:`world <world>`.

What then does the proposition "*it is possible there is an afterlife*" mean? How does something come to be outside of time and space? How does something come to be without being the consequence of something? One might as well say "*it is possible that possibility is impossible*". 

Then, there are two types of uncertainty: An *ontological* uncertainty, which admits itself as a measure via quantization of possibility, for it is an uncertainty about :ref:`being <being>`, and a *metaphysical* uncertainty, which admits of no quantiziation because its actualities never :ref:`are <being>` never actually manifested in the :ref:`world <world>`, even through appearances, for it is an uncertainty about :ref:`appearance <phenomena>` and :ref:`existence <existence>` itself.

Do mathematical theorems have truth outside of ourselves? To what extent is existence mathematical in the absence of our :ref:`being <being>` mathematical? Does our description of the appearance of reality ever penetrate to reality itself? What is reality outside of our description of it?

The :ref:`world <world>` inherently has an order, a structure that separates events through succession. Causality is manifest in time and space; things are a certain way, meaning the sequence of things that led to the current state of the world was just so and not some other way. Causality imposes a particular order on events, excluding the possibility of other orderings. Each event, by occuring, fixes the order of time as the particular circumstances that led to the current becoming of the :ref:`world`. It is a fact of symbolic logic that order relations must be anti-reflexive.

A reflexive relation is one that is the same forwards as backwards, i.e. :math:`x = y` is equivalent to :math:`y = x`.

An anti-reflexive relation can be seen in the relation of "*less than*", i.e. :math:`x < y` is not equivalent to :math:`y < x`. This asymmetry in the relation is what gives rises to its ordering. Because the relation cannot be reflected, the field of its values necessarily has an order, that is to say, each integer increases in magnitude, i.e. it is greater than its precedessor. 

The ordering of time and space must necessarily make us ask, what is it about :ref:`being <being>` that is anti-reflexive? Where is the asymmetry in :ref:`being` to be found? Why are things always one way and not some other way? Why are things perceived in a linear fashion, that is to say, as a succession of form though time? What primitve rupture in reflection causes time to move forward, making thigns have an order?

---

    "I am this"

    "This is me"

When reflected, the "*am*" becomes an "*is*". Is this purely linguistic, an artifact of the peculiar evolution of the word ":ref:`being`"? Or is this the aforementioned rupture in the relation of :ref:`being <being>`? The English "*am*" is one-directional. It latches to its subject and severs its reflexivity. The  "*am*" reduces to "*is*" when the subject is object. 

The "*is*" does not have this property.

    "This is a person."

    "A person is this.""

"*is*", in other words, is reflexive. There is no ordering in the existential relation of Being. It is, as mentioned, an equivalency relation. 

---

The question, as always, is: is subjective :ref:`being <being>` the same as objective :ref:`being <being>`? And if it is, why does our linguistic representation of it bare the logical features of ordering? Why does our language allow the relation of "*am*" to operate in a non-reflexive way? 

---

.. topic:: Conjecture

    *am* is the asymmetric *is*. 
    
Or, in terms of ontological relations, existential :ref:`being <being>` is an equivalency relation. Subjective :ref:`being <being>` is an ordering relation.

Everything is language.

Everything signifies something it is not. 

As I get older, the thoughts are harder to string together. More and more, it is a morass of half-understood images, glimpsed with uncertain comprehension. It feels like my mind is falling apart. 

I want to say something definite: that what we are is symbolic. Our nature consists of naming and relating. There is no greater power in this world than to invoke a thing's name, to draw it into the foreground of attention and present that which is named as a singular thing, separate and isolated from the world in which it arose. 

They tell me I am made of particles, incomprehensibly tiny things that are concentrated into mathematical points, but then I am told this is not quite right, because points have positions and no one has ever been able to say where exactly a particle is. 

Science has a hole in its foundation. Or more precisely: an impassable bedrock that prevents the inductive advance of human knowledge beyond a prescribed depth, the limit of abstraction. Predicated on measurement, science immediately deteriorates when the truth upon which it rests is sought. 

The idea that things can be measured relies on the idea that a property of a thing can be abstracted away from the thing's being. A thing is not a unit, but it is equal, in some way, to the units which comprise its measurement. Equality, as a concept, only obtains when a thing is abstracted of its qualities and reduced to a quantitative description. 

To understand everything as measureable is to understand everything as a quantity. The act of measurement is equivalent to comparison of quantities. A thing is named to be the unit. To measure a thing is to relate it to this designation. To say a thing has two units is to say it has two units *of* the designated unit. 

Humans have somehow inverted the direction of dependence in the relation of measurement to reality. We live with an unconscious assumption, at least in aggregate within the context of the modern world, one that happens to be false: that measurement is equivalent to substantial existence. We have abstracted from measurement a definite mathematical structure the world must abide. However, this abstraction was preceded in its application by initialization of the unit. The abstraction is dependent on the designations. And so we fail to comprehend the fundamental uncertainty from which being is born.

Measurement can only exist in relation to the units which have been demarcated and designated as things which measure. Measurability cannot be the basis for being, because it must be predicated on a reference to another being, namely the unit, which only exists as a designation within an interpretation. In other words, the entire edifice of science presupposes a subject is *in the world*, engaged in the act of interpretation.

---

There are no answers. More fundamentally, there does not even exist the possibility of an answer.

---

The problem is :ref:`truth <truth>`. It's impossible to define. More precisely: it's definition undoes its foundation. If you say: something is true if it is the case (i.e. agrees with reality), then by allowing the indeterminate sentence to be named, even with a name so innocuous as "something", you've allowed the necessary and sufficient conditions for a contradiction to emerge. Let the next sentence be called P. The sentence P is not true. Then, by our definition of truth, we see we have named an undecidable sentence.  More than that, we have annihilated the possibility of truth by demonstrating an example of something to which it cannot apply, that is, something neither true or false. Self reference is a paradox that cannot be exorcised; it's impossible to give a name to something without that name referencing the thing to be named. You cannot talk about truth without giving things names and you cannot name a thing without decimating the foundations of language. We arise from a vacuum of meaning, and blindly seek what cannot be sought. All that we know and think is built on top of a void.

Long moments where nothing happens. Half-formed sentences grasping at incoherent thoughts. 

Did the universe feel the vice grip of anxiety, were its innards churned in vexing anticipation, as it awaited us? Did the universe agonize over every solemn moment, measure every millisecond with precise stop watches, while those who might bear witness gestated in possibility? 

Did it idle in indifference? Did eternities tick by unnoticed? Was there nothing that might slow the passing of time, no passing glance of introspection, no fractal blossoming out of an instant, no reason to stop and watch in awe?

Was there time at all?

How strange, to find yourself in a moment, with only trails of breadcrumbs fading in the horizon to tell you what came before. To traverse any of these passages only extends them indefinitely, adding more long seconds, more breadcrumbs trailing backwards from your position.

How strange, to only be able to think in terms of time. Never able to ask what came *before* time. 

The question invokes absurdity. Of course, you are a product of your parents, and them of their grandparents, and so on, one long chain extending back to some point in the past where it either breaks or begins. Is there always someone prior, some ancestor from which we derive our heritage, at every link in the chain? Is everything preceded by cause?  

Is time infinite? Or finite? Does it exist outside of our perception? Is it merely a *form* of perception? Something revealed through the act of perception? If so, then what exists in the absence of perception? Is :being-without-us static and eternal, timeless and formless? Does it *exist* all?

At what point, in tracing our anthropological origins, do we encounter the point where being becomes being-without-us? Presumably there must have been a point in time when there were no conscious entities and in the next moment, there were. How far back does the chain go? Is it possible to conceive of being-without-space? Being-without-time?

Is it possible to conceive of this moment? Are we incapable of understanding what the world is if we subtracted from it?

Is the ladder of causality we extend indefinitely into the past flawed in some way? Does it measure reality? Is it an artifice?

Things only have causes insofar we perceive in them in a complex. We say *A* causes *B* because we perceive a temporal relation between *A* and *B*, a dependency that requires one precede the other. The causal link is only :ref:`true <truth>` insofar that we may use it to predict the occurrence of *B* given *A*. 

This is, at any rate, what we mean in a scientific sense. :ref:`Truth <truth>` in this respect is a property of judgement, it is an emanation of judgement. But this definition of truth does not allow us to take its content and make them absolute. It is always relative to the perception that perceives the relation between *A* and *B*. 

This definition of :ref:`truth <truth>` does not allow us to take the observations and derive from them absolute truth. We are always relegated to saying "*assuming this is the case*". But we are never able to remove all assumptions from any proposition. Always there are priors that precede everything.

We cannot say with certainty *what there is outside of ourselves*. We cannot get to that hypothetical moment in time of *being-without-us* through pure understanding. We cannot even say we know there *is* a *being-without-us*.

The first act of a fool is not the presumption preceding a judgement, but the certainty that follows it. 

Certainty is a curious thing. 

The things of which we are most certain, e.g. the feelings and sensations that comprise our phenomenal experience, are not properties of the external world. The certainty of our desire and intentions is due to their origination from within the deepest chambers of our selves, in the privative isolation of our consciousness. We are certain of what we feel, because what we are is, entirely and exactly, what we feel. 

The things of which we are least certain, e.g. the true reality of the external world, are quantifiable properties, things which can be counted and grouped into definite amounts. There is no procedure outside of perception and judgement by which external things may enter into the internal constitution of a consciousness. Things of the external world must be represented in the perception, which in turn requires the image of the thing projected onto the sense organ must be detached from the thing itself. The sensuous thing which is perceived is only an indication of the actual thing, i.e. a representation. 

Certainty, then, is only absolute in the subjective sense.

    ":ref:`Being <being>`" is said in many ways. 

    -- `Categories`_, Aristotle

It is first of all said, and "*to be said*" requires what is said to be expressible in language. Every linguistic form is a representation. Therefore, something said is necessarily representative of some other thing. What a representation is and what it is representative of is left vague in the beginning, but the form of representation is not: language.  

In order to understand the initial statement, one then turns to an analysis of language in order to clarify what could possibly be meant by a thing which can be said. A description of language is a necesary component of any exposition that wants to analyze the ways in which "*being*" is said. In making this description, one immediately encounters the essential problem in ontological endeavors: describing the operation of "*description*"" is itself a description. 

Every system of thought, by objectifying the world, makes an object of itself within that system. "*System*" in this sense is synonymous with and equivalent to "*language*".

For instance, lingustic representations possess the property of standing for things they themselves are not. 

.. note::

    Let "*R*" stand for things that are red. 

    Let "*B*" stand for things that are blue.

Here a letter, "*R*" or "*B*" , stands in place of something else. These letters are *representations*. Note the letter "*R*"" is not a thing that is red, except in circumstances where it is printed in red ink. Rather, it symbolizes the conjunction in thought of elements that possess the attribute of "*being red*". The letter "*R*" makes an abstraction of the elements we agree belong to it. 

---

On the other hand, there are sometimes classes of words that stand for themselves, or at least include themselves in that for which they stand. For example, the word "*word*" is a word that stands for the thing which it is,

    "*Word*" is a word.

However, a crucial distinction must be drawn in these cases. The quotation marks in the preceding example are not frivolities. They are a necessary component of the proposition, for they provide a boundary that outlines a thing's *name*. Sans quotation marks, the proposition descends into senselessness,

    Word is a word.

This analysis hinges on the realization first proffered by :ref:`Tarski <tarski>` that there is a consequential difference between the language in which we speak propositions of a language and the language in which we speak *about* the propositions of a language. 

    The language one speaks is not necessarily the language about which one speaks. 

Confusion often results when the same language performs both functions. In the case of mathematics, where the proposition language is that of, say, arithmetic, and the description language that of logic, the distinction is easier to maintain. When doing philosophy, the different levels of speech often waver and blur together, leading to confusion. For the purposes of clarity, quotation marks serve the function of referring to the name of the concept addressed whereas a unquoted word expresses what is meant by the concept. This lack of clarity throughout history is one of the root causes of Martin Heidegger's deconstruction of " :ref:`Being <being>` " in the early twentieth century.

If the goal is to define " :ref:`Being <being>` ", then one can only succeed at the level of description. A description *about* a " :ref:`Being <being>` " is incapable of saying what is meant by " :ref:`Being <being>` ".

When one authentically speaks the phrase "*I know this*", one understands this to be meant in the context of certainy. "*Knowledge*", if the term is to mean anything at all, must be defined in terms of certainty. "*It is known*" must be replaceable in all instances with "*it is certain*"

The question of what is certain has no obvious or immediate answer, and so the existence of pure knowledge, of a kind that is absolute and without condition, is called into question. The world and all of its contents seem so hopelessly dependent on the subjective experience that one cannot truly convince one's self that it exists in the absence of the subject. 

The world presents itself, but the basis for the knowledge of this presentation is its representation to the self. 

Everything imaginable is contained in, or possibly equal to, the enumeration of all possible representations. What cannot be imagined is precisely that which cannot be represented to the self. If a possibility exists that cannot be imagined, then it is only because "*self*" does not entail the totality of possibility. This can only occur if the representations presented to the self are incomplete, that is, if the presentation lacks content that cannot be comprehended through its representative form. 

---

.. epigraph::

    If you do know that "*here is one hand*", we'll grant you all the rest.

    -- `On Certainty`_, Wittgenstein

If the objective is to produce a certain fact, then all assumptions must be removed and one must start from nothing. Only the production of a fact from nullity would be able to satisfy any reasonable definition of "*certainty*". If a fact derives from a prior assumption, then the fact is only as certain as its constitutive assumptions. Therefore, the question of the validity of the concept of "*certainy*" reduces to the question of whether positive knowledge can be derived from nothing. 

It is a maxim of post-Kantian philosophy that what is known must be known through the experience of "*knowing*", and thus it must be conditioned by experience. Knowledge of a thing is knowledge of the sensuous experience of the thing and what the sensuous cannot present to experience cannot be known.

For any object of experience, its attributes may be abstracted away in thought, but even an indeterminate object must possess a condition of determination for being able to be an object of experience; it is this form of determination that Kant identifies as " :ref:`a priori <a-priori-a-posteriori>` ". If, from a thing, its manifest qualities are subtracted, one is left with the pure abstract relation that sensuous experience deploys in order to perform the ontological operation of objectification.

The operands of the objectification are the experience for which the object is the object thus identified by experience. This operation yields a unique index, which one is inclined to call an object's "*name*". In other words, receptivity to naming is a prerequisite for being knowable. A thing cannot be known unless it can be named.

The inverse does not follow. One cannot conclude from "*if a thing cannot be named, then it cannot be known*" that "*if a thing cannot be known, then a thing cannot be named*". If the latter were the case, then one would lack a proper name for " :ref:`nothing <nothing>` ".

    What is not truly one :ref:`being <being>` is not truly *one* :ref:`being <being>` either.

    -- `Leibniz Letters`_, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz

To say the same thing in a different way,

    To be a *being* is to be *a* being.

Apparently tautological in form, the exact meaning of the Liebniz's proposition can only be understood through the emphasis placed on its constituent words, which in turn immediately enriches its otherwise vacuous content. In this way, the words in Leibniz's proposition have semantic content that is not contained in their letters, if by "*letters*" it is meant "*characters of the alphabet*". This is obvious in languages with aspirated breathing marks, where the operation of emphasis possesses a symbol within the language, but English can be deceptive in this regard, for italicization or boldening are not normally considered a linguistic symbol, even though they possess no warrant to belong to any other classification. 

Leibniz's emphasis is a form of naming that would more naturally be represented with quotation marks. The lefthand side of the proposition selects the name of being, "*being*", preparing it for the operation of definition. The selection is then equated through the copula of being to the righthand side, which defines the named being as the being of the name of the article through which it is selected for naming. A "*being*" is nothing more than an index attached to a being. 

The operation of naming can be understood in terms of pure direction. A rule is given that picks a name from the domain of names and assigns to it an object in the domain of objects. In the preceding sentence, "*object*" is not necessarily equivalent to "*thing*", and might be more precisely described as "*an indeterminate being*".

Consider the infinite sequence of squares, 

.. math:: 

    \{ 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, ... \}

In what sense is this sequence (*set*, *class*, *abstraction*) equivalent to the following function?

.. math::

    f(n) = n ^ 2

"*f*" is a formal statement, devoid of content. It must be interpretted to have any meaning. This equivalence can only be maintained if the function "*f*" is understood to be assigning a name from the domain of natural numbers to each element in the domain of squares. "*f*" names each element in the sequence of squares by indexing them. In other words, "*0*"" is the name of first square, "*1*"" is the name of the second square, "*4*"" is the name of the third square, et cetera. 

Frege was the first to recognize the mathematical function as possessing the formal structure of a "*name*".

The desire for exegesis cannot be met without recourse to personal experience, and in introducing the subjective element, the exegesis itself is undone. One wants a formal deduction, a series of arguments absolute and pure, proceeding from a starting point whose self-evidence is immanent. One wants to find the words to lay upon this thing called life like a map, to show what it is and how it is to be understood. We seek a science that explains what it is to be, that will, as part of its apparatus, integrate our very consciousness into its fabric and render unto us a divine sort of revelation.

This is the essential human delusion. Essential, because it resides in every activity; there is nothing which is that does not presuppose the law of cause and effect, and so we come to be supposing all which is must abide this fundamental law. Human, because it is our :ref:`poetical <syntagmics>` curse to attach symbols to objects. Delusion, because the subject will never find itself among objects, except as an object.

We imagine the written word like a mirror, a silvered surface that reflects and reveals its point of origin through precise geometry but our thoughts are not like rays of light, and the page is no surface to preserve in perfect fashion the objects incident upon it. The word always grasps towards what it wants to represent, but fails in its approach. 

Is there a series of words that explains the world's churning? Mathematicians tells us to fix our definitions, and let logic unfold. With what definition do we start? *To be*, seems the most general of relations, the most primitive of terms. Thus, we initiate again an Aristotelian chain, whose history is available to any student of philsophy. Such an exercise, though worthwhile, will only yield formal results, against which we will inevitably rebel in Heideggerian fashion, and then succumb, forgetting in essence our original task. 

I want to tell you what I know, but the words that I would use to give form to my thoughts escape me. I labor in vain for quiet hours. There is structure in our experience, in our lives, underneath its surface, if only it were presented, so that it might be represented in symbolic form. 

It is easy to slip into solipsism, like a Cartesian fingertrap. One must remember that :ref:`language <language>` presumes the presence of another. Though the world as we know it may lack facts, it never lacks form. The existence of words is testament to the communal aspect of reality, that when we are in the :ref:`world <world>`, we are in the :ref:`world <world>` with someone else. The :ref:`world <world>`, a veil though it may be in its appearance, is substantial, because it can be described, and a decription can only exist *for* someone. 

Let us start any exegesis with this simple proposition whose tautological nature is thus self evident:

    What is said requires some one to say it.

Let us use this a ballast when the ontological investigations we undertake lead us astray, into a nihilistic miasma.

The Context Problem
-------------------

As a thought experiment, suppose you encountered a string in an unknown language,

.. math::

    a = b = c 

Without any further information about the language, nearly any interpretation can be assigned to this expression. There is a small amount of information encoded in the repetition of "=", which imposes a light constraint on the possible interpretations, but the meaning of these interpretations is still too diverse to say with any measure of certainty what this expression could possibly mean. "=" could, for example, serve the dual role of a *relativizer* and an *indicator*, allowing such interpretations as,

    lady that sings that tune

In this interpretation, "a" is assigned the meaning of "(the) lady", "b" that of "sings" and "c" that of "tune". Obviously, a large number, possibly infinite in size, of such expressions can be constructed. 

Suppose you are provided a dictionary of *primitive* symbols. This dictionary fixes the meaning of the "=" to the familiar concept of "equality". However, even this disambiguating assignment stills the leave door open to a myriad of interpretations. This assignment imposes only the lightest of constraints on the other word-forms in the expression. For example, it is unclear if the expression with the "equality" assignment should be interpretted as meaning,

    "a = b" and "b = c"

Or

    a = (b = c)

Or

    (a = b) = c

In the first interpretation, "a", "b" and "c" must represent terms within the language. In the second interpretation, "a" fills the meta-role of a truth value while "b" and "c" fill the roles of terms in the object language. In the third interpretation, "a" and "b" fill the roles of object terms while "c" fills the role of a truth value. 

In other words, the assignment of the meaning of "=" imposes certain constraints on the values the other word-forms in the expression may range over, but ambiguity still remains. Indeed, it may argued a quanta of ambiguity is always present in any interpretation assigned to a string of symbols. 

The essential *context* problem boils down to: what word-form in an expression should be treated as primitive in order to be used as a foundation upon which to build the subsequent interpretation.

There are two mutually exclusive categories of :ref:`palindromes <definition-4-1-1>` in any language: perfect and imperfect. 

A :ref:`perfect palindrome <definition-4-1-2>` is symmetric, by which it is meant a :ref:`perfect palindrome <definition-4-1-2>` may be reversed character-wise. Of the "species" of :ref:`palindromes <definition-4-1-1>` in any given language, they are the most rare, because their grammatical conditions are so stringent (at least as far as English is concerned). Counter-intuitively, this makes them the easiest to construct. 

:ref:`Perfect palindromes <definition-4-1-2>` mostly hinge on :ref:`invertible <invertible-words>` grammatical structures embodied in the "*on-no*", "*now-won*" and "*saw-was*" invertible pairs. Without these invertible pivot points, a :ref:`perfect palindromes <definition-4-1-2>` must rely on the symmetry of a central :ref:`palindromic word <reflective-words>`. In other words, the cardinality of :ref:`perfect palindromes <definition-4-1-2>` is related to the cardinality of :ref:`invertible words <invertible-words>` and the cardinality of purely :ref:`reflective words <reflective-words>`. 

- repel on no leper
- dog saw raw war was god
- gateman now won nametag
- snoops now won spoons
- pupils did slipup
- strips deified spirits

:ref:`Imperfect palindromes <definition-4-1-3>`, by contrast, degrade under reversal. Consider cases like "*borrow or rob*" or "*name now one man*" which, while palindromic, do not preserve semantic content when reversed. However, by dropping the delimiting character, namely the space " ", the palindromicity can be reconstructed in a degenerate alphabet, e.g. "*borroworob*" and "*namenowoneman*" are palindromic strings in an alphabet with no delimiting characters.

These observations suggest an algebraic structure exists embedded within linguistics. Let :math:`\zeta` be a sentence, defined as a sequence of characters. Then, define the :ref:`inverse <string-inversion>` of a sentence, :math:`\text{inv}(\zeta)`, as the reversal of :math:`\zeta`'s characters. Furthermore, define the :ref:`reduction <definition-3-1-2>` of a sentence, :math:`\varsigma(\zeta)`, as the string which results from the removal of delimiter characters from :math:`\zeta`. Then, palindromes, :math:`\zeta_p` can be defined mathematically as the sentences whose reduced forms are equal to their own inverses,

.. math::

    \varsigma(\zeta_p) = \text{inv}(\varsigma(\zeta_p))

It can be shown that inversion and reduction, which are string operations, commute over strings, so the above equation can be extended,

.. math::

    \varsigma(\zeta_p) = \varsigma(\text{inv}(\zeta_p)) = \text{inv}(\varsigma(\zeta_p))

In other words, palindromes, perfect and imperfect, are exactly the class of sentences which satsify this formal constraint.

In contrast, a Hysteron Proteron is a form of word play that requires more than just symbol shunting. Its essence involves the interpretation of its component parts which simultaneously places them into a contradictory whole.

We imagine language to behave like objects, because it manifests through objects. But objectification removes the object from its surroundings. It decontextualizes it. We think language is something definite, something well defined. But it's more like vague constellations, networks of meanings. Everything connects to everything else. Language is the ability to synthesize. It can have layers. Anything can represent anything. And when you remove one connection, the rest blossom to take its place.

What is language? Did it emerge gradually or all at once? Was there a point in time where no language existed and the next it did? 

Does the distinction between *metalanguage* and *object language* exist in actuality? Is there a language *about* language, where the general conditions for language can be precisely specified? What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for language? Can language be described in aggregate? 

The nature of language is elusive. It begs an unending series of questions and offers little in the way of answers. It resists definition, for definitions occur within it. It resists analysis, for analysis occurs within it. Language is a vicuous circle. Language is *the* vicuous circle, from which all others originate. Language is inescapable and intractable. One might attempt to formalize language, but every attempt hitherto has failed. There are always aspects of language that exceed any container we construct for it. Indeed, there appear to be certain syntactical constraints that can be placed on the general science of language:

1. Language is a hierarchy of ordered sequences. Words are ordered sequences of characters. Sentences are ordered sequences of words. 

This seems fundamental. If there is a purely logical and formal principle underlying language, surely this is it.  Almost every known language conforms to this model, in some way. However, even with this meager claim, the most miniscule of structural propositions (that structure *exists*), counter-examples can be produced that show this axiom fails to span the entire breadth of the phenomenon of language. 

To start, the concept of declension immediately challenges this hierarchical model of language. In languages like Greek or Latin, the suffixes appended to words denote its part of speech. Consider the three Latin sentences,

- Puella canem videt. (Girl dog sees)
- Canem puella videt. (Dog girl sees)
- Videt puella canem. (Sees girl dog)

Each sentence, in essence, expresses the same proposition, showing that sentences are not necessarily constrained to be ordered sequences of words. The order of the declined words is not *meaningless* in this example, as order in declined language often denotes emphasis, but importantly, it is not the *primary* bearer of meaning. However, the spirit of the model can be recovered by adjusting structure of hierarchy, perhaps by adding a layer above sentence for "*tokens*", of which each of the previous sentences is an instance. 

However, there is a more fundamental challenge to the hierarchical model of language. Similar to declension, agglutinative languages accumulate meaning through roots and suffixes. "*Sentences*" in an agglutinative languages are often indistinguishable from "*words*".

In the Native America language of Central Alaskan Yup'ik,

    tuntussuqatarniksaitengqiggtuq

Translates roughly to "*He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer.*" Describing this linguistic entity as a "*word*" does not fully elucidate its role in Yup'ik language. The "*words*" of the "*sentence*" are not delimited by blank characters or other marks, so that it appears to an Indo-European speaker to be a single word. This "*sentence-word*" is formed by stacking morphemes into a single word,

1. ``tuntu-``: reindeer

    This is a very approximate mapping to English. Take it with a grain of salt.

The essential nature of language appears to be sequential, but identifying *what* is being sequenced presents a problem. We want to name the terms of linguistic science, but there seems to be no universal property that is manifested in every instance of language. There is no concept that can be wrapped around the entirety of language, no salience that can be abstracted into a formal representation.
