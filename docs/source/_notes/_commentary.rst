	**Socrates**: Have you heard what they say nowadays that knowing is?
	
	**Theatetus**: Perhaps; however, I do not remember just at this moment.
	
	**Socrates**: They say it is having knowledge.
	
	**Theatetus**: True.
	
	**Socrates**: Let us make a slight change and say possessing knowledge.
	
	**Theatetus**: Why, how will you claim that the one differs from the other?
	
	**Socrates**: Well, then, having does not seem to me the same as possessing. For instance, if a man bought a cloak and had it under his control, but did not wear it, we should certainly not say that he had it, but that possessed it.
	
	**Theatetus**: And rightly.
	
	**Socrates**: Now see whether it is possible in the same way for one who possesses knowledge not to have it, as, for instance, if a man should catch wild birds--pigeons or the like--and should arrange an aviary at home and keep them in it, we might in a way assert that he always has them because he possesses them, might we not?
	
	**Theatetus**: Yes.
	
	**Socrates**: And yet in another way that he has none of them, but that he has acquired power over them, since he has brought them under his control in his own enclosure, to take them and hold them whenever he likes, by catching whichever bird he pleases, and to let them go again; and he can do this as often as he pleases.

.. epigraph::

  That all our knowledge begins with experience there can be no doubt. For how should the faculty of knowledge be called into activity, if not by objects which affect our senses and which, on the one hand, produce representations by themselves or on the other, rouse the activity of our understanding to compare, connect, or to separate them and thus to convert the raw material of our sensible impressions into knowledge of objects, which we call experience? With respect to time, therefore, no knowledge within us is antecedent to experience, but all knowledge begins with it.
  
  But though all our knowledge begins with experience, it does not follow that it all arises from experience. For it is quite possible that even our empirical knowledge is a compound of that which we perceive through impression, and of that which our own faculty of knowledge (incited by sense impressions) supplies from itself, a supplement which we do not distinguish from that raw material until long practice has rendered us capable of separating one from the other. It is therefore a question which deserves at least closer investigation and cannot be disposed of at first sight: Whether there is any knowledge independent of all experience and even of all impressions of the senses? Such knowledge is called ":ref:`a priori <a-priori-a-posteriori>`" and is distinguished from empirical knowledge, which has its source ":ref:`a posteriori <a-priori-a-posteriori>`", that is, in experience...

.. epigraph::

  :ref:`Dasein <being>` is an :ref:`Seiendes <being>` which does not just occur among other :Ref:`Seienden <being>`. Rather it is ontically distinguished by the fact that, in its very :ref:`Sein <being>`, that :ref:`Sein <being>` is an issue for it. But in that case, this is a constitutive state of  :ref:`Dasein <being>`'s :ref:`Sein <being>`, and this implies that :ref:`Dasein <being>`, in its :ref:`Sein <being>`, has a relationship towards that :ref:`Sein <being>`— a relationship which itself is one of :ref:`Sein <being>`. And this means further that there is some way in which  :ref:`Dasein <being>` understands itself in its :ref:`Sein <being>`,, and that to some degree it does so explicitly. It is peculiar to this entity that with and through its :ref:`Sein <being>`, this :ref:`Sein <being>`, is disclosed to it. Understanding of :ref:`Sein <being>` is itself a definite characteristic of  :ref:`Dasein's <being>` :ref:`Sein <being>`.  :ref:`Dasein <being>` is ontically distinctive in that it is ontological.

  I must here combat the view that, e.g. :math:`2 + 5` and :math:`3 + 4` are equal but not the same. This view is grounded in the same confusion of form and content, sign and thing signified. It is a though one wanted to regard the sweet-smelling violet as differing from *Viola odorata* because the names sound different. Difference of sign cannot by itself be a sufficient ground for difference of the thing signified. The only reason why in our case the matter is less obvious is that the :ref:`bedeutung` of the numeral 17 is not anything perceptible to the senses. There is at present a very widespread tendency not to recognize as an object anything that cannot be perceived by means of the senses; this leads here to numerals' being taken to be numbers, the proper objects of our discussion; and then, I admit, 7 and 2 + 5 would indeed be different. But such a conception is untenable, for we cannot speak of any arithmetical properties of numbers whatsoever without going back to the :ref:`bedeutung` of the signs. For example, the property belonging to 1, of being the result of multiplying itself by itself, would be a mere myth; for no microscopical or chemical investigation, however far it was carried, could ever detect this property in the possession of the innocent character that we call a figure one. Perhaps there is talk of a definition; but no definition is creative in the sense of being able to endow a thing with properties that it has not already got -- apart from the one property of expressing and signifying something in virtue of the definition. The characters we call numerals have, on the other hand, physical and chemical properties depending on the writing material. One could imagine the introduction some day of quite new numerals, just as, e.g., the Arabic numerals superseded the Roman. Nobody is seriously going to suppose that in this way we should get quite new numbers, quite new arithmetical objects, with properties still to be investigated. Thus we must distinguish between numerals and their *Bedeutungen*; and if so, we shall have to recognize that the expression :math:`2`, :math:`1 + 1`, :math:`3 - 1`, :math:`\frac{6}{3}` all have the same :ref`bedeutung`, for it is quite inconceivable where the difference between them could lie. Perhaps you say, :math:`1 + 1` is a sum, but :math:`\frac{6}{3}` is a quotient. But what is :math:`\frac{6}{3}`? The number that when multiplied by :math:`3` gives the result :math:`6`. We say "*the* number", not "*a* number"; by using the definite article, we indicate that there is only a single number.

  -- `Function and Concept <https://fitelson.org/proseminar/frege_fac.pdf>`_, Gottlob Frege, 1891 AD

.. epigraph::

  Equality gives rise to challenging questions which are not altogether easy to answer. Is it a relation? A relation between objects, or between names or signs of objects? In my *Begriffsschrift* I assumed the latter. The reasons which seem to favour this are the following: :math:`a = a` and :math:`a = b` are obviously statements of differing cognitive value; :math:`a = a` holds a priori and, according to Kant, is to be labeled analytic, while statements of the form :math:`a = b` often contain very valuable extensions of our knowledge and cannot always be established a priori. The discovery that the rising sun is not new every morning, but always the same, was one of the most fertile astronomical discoveries. Even today the identification of a small planet or a comet is not always a matter of course. Now if we were to regard equality as a relation between that which the names 'a' and 'b' designate (*bedeuten*), it would seem that :math:`a = b` could not differ from a = a (i.e. provided :math:`a = b` is true). A relation would thereby be expressed of a thing to itself, and indeed one in which each thing stands to itself but to no other thing. What is intended to be said by :math:`a = b` seems to be that the signs or names 'a' and 'b' designate (*bedeuten*) the same thing, so that those signs themselves would be under discussion; a relation between them would be asserted. But this relation would hold between the names or signs only in so far as they named or designated something. It would be mediated by the connexion of each of the two signs with the same designated thing. But this is arbitrary. Nobody can be forbidden to use any arbitrarily producible event or object as a sign for something. 
      
  In that case the sentence :math:`a = b` would no longer refer to the subject matter, but only to its mode of designation; we would express no proper knowledge by its means. But in many cases this is just what we want to do. If the sign '*a*' is distinguished from the sign 'b' only as object (here, by means of its shape), not as sign (i.e. not by the manner in which it designates something), the cognitive value of :math:`a = a` becomes essentially equal to that of :math:`a = b`, provided :math:`a = b` is true. A difference can arise only if the difference between the signs corresponds to a difference in the mode of presentation of that which is designated. Let *a*, *b*, *c* be the lines connecting the vertices of a triangle with the midpoints of the opposite sides. The point of intersection of *a* and *b* is then the same as the point of intersection of *b* and *c*. So we have different designations for the same point, and these names ('*point of intersection of a and b*', '*point of intersection of b and c'*) likewise indicate the mode of presentation; and hence the statement contains actual knowledge.

  It is natural, now, to think of there being connected with a sign (name, combination of words, letter), besides that to which the sign refers, which may be called the :ref:`bedeutung` of the sign, also what I should like to call the sense of the sign, wherein the mode of presentation is contained. In our example, accordingly, the :ref:`bedeutung` of the expressions '*point of intersection of a and b*' and '*point of intersection of b and c*' would be the same, but not their senses. The :ref:`bedeutung` of '*evening star*' would be the same as that of '*morning star*', but not the sense.

  It is clear from the context that by '*sign*' and '*name*' I have here understood any designation representing a proper name, which thus has as its :ref:`bedeutung` a definite object (this word taken in the widest range), but not a concept or a relation, which shall be discussed further in another article. The designation of a single object can also consist of several words or other signs. For brevity, let every such designation be called a proper name.

  The sense of a proper name is grasped by everybody who is sufficiently familiar with the language or totality of designations to which it belongs; but this serves to illuminate only a single aspect of the :ref:`bedeutung`, supposing it to have one. Comprehensive knowledge of the :ref:`bedeutung` would require us to say immediately whether any given sense belongs to it. To such knowledge we never attain.

  The regular connexion between a sign, its sense, and its :ref:`bedeutung` is of such a kind that to the sign there corresponds a definite sense and to that in turn a definite reference, while to a given :ref:`bedeutung` (an object) there does not belong only a single sign. The same sense has different expression in different languages or even in the same language. To be sure, exceptions to this regular behaviour occur. To every expression belonging to a complete totality of signs, there should certainly correspond a definite sense; but natural languages often do not satisfy this condition, and one must be content if the same word has the same sense in the same context. It may perhaps be granted that every grammatically well-formed expression representing a proper name always has a sense. But this is not to say that to the sense there also corresponds a :ref:`bedeutung`. The words '*the celestial body most distant from the Earth*' have a sense, but it is very doubtful if they also have a reference. The expression '*the least rapidly convergent series*' has a sense; but it is known to have no reference, since for every given convergent series, another convergent, but less rapidly convergent, series can be found. In grasping a sense, one is not certainly assured of a reference.

  -- `On Sinn and Bedeutung <https://archive.org/details/OnSenseAndReference>`_, Gottlob Frege (Max Black translation), 1891 AD
  
  A concept - as I understand the word - is predicative^ On the other hand, a name of an object, a proper name, it quite incapable of being used as a grammatical predicate. This admittedly needs elucidation, otherwise it might appear false. Surely one can just as well assert of a thing that it is Alexander the Great, or is the number four, or is the planet Venus, as that it is green or is a mammal? If anybody thinks this, he is not distinguishing the uses of the word '*is*'. In the last two examples it serves as a copula, as a mere verbal sign of predication. As such it can sometimes be replaced by the mere personal suffix. Compare, e.g., '*Dieses Blatt ist griin*' and '*Dieses Blatt grunt*'.We are here saying that something falls under a concept, and the grammatical predicate stands for (*bedeutet*) this concept. In the first three examples, on the other hand, 'is' is used like the 'equals' sign in arithmetic, to express an equation. In the sentence '*The Morning Star is Venus*', we have two proper names, '*Morning Star*' and '*Venus*', for the same object. In the sentence '*The Morning Star is a planet*' we have a proper name, '*the Morning Star*', and a concept word, '*planet*'. So far as language goes, no more has happened than that '*Venus*' has been replaced by '*a planet*'; but really the relation has become wholly different. An equation is reversible; an object's falling under a concept is an irreversible relation. In the sentence '*The Morning Star is Venus*', '*is*' is obviously not the mere copula; its content is an essential part of the predicate, so that the word 'Venus' does not constitute the whole of the predicate. One might say instead: '*The Morning Star is no other than Venus*'; what was previously implicit in the single word 'is' is here set in four separate words, and in '*is no other than*' the word '*is*' now really is the mere copula. What is predicated here is thus not Venus but no other than Venus. These words stand for (*bedeuteri*) a concept; admitedly only one object falls under this, but such a concept must still always be distinguished from the object. We have here a word '*Venus*' that can never be a proper predicate, although it can form part of a predicate. The :ref:`bedeutung` of this word is thus something that can never incur as a concept, but only as an object.

  What is the :ref:`nothing` ? Our very first approach to this question has something unusual about it. In our asking we posit the :ref:`nothing` in advance as something that "is" such and such; we posit it as a being. But that is exactly what it is distinguished from. Interrogating the :ref:`nothing`--asking what and how it, the :ref:`nothing`, is--turns what is interrogated into its opposite. The question deprives itself of its own object. Accordingly, every answer to this question is also impossible from the start. For it necessarily assumes the form, the nothing "is" this or that. With regard to the nothing, question and answer alike are inherently absurd.

.. epigraph::

  Presence to self, on the contrary, supposes that an impalpable fissure has slipped into being. If being is present to itself, it is because it is not wholly itself. Presence is an immediate deterioration of coincidence, for it supposes separation. But if we ask ourselves at this point "what it is" which separates the subject from himself, we are forced to admit it is ":ref:`nothing`". Ordinarily what separates is a distance in space, a lapse in time, a psychological difference, or simply the individuality of two co-presents--in short, a "qualified" reality. But in the case which concerns us, ":ref:`nothing`" can separate the consciousness of belief from belief, since belief is "nothing other" than the consciousness of belief.

.. epigraph::

  Naturally, because the void is indiscernible as a term (because it is not-one), its inaugural appearance is a pure act of nomination. This name cannot be specific; it cannot place the void under anything that would subsume it--this would reestablish the one. The name cannot indicate that the void is this or that. The act of nomination, being a-specific, consumes itself, indicating :ref:`nothing` other than the unpresentable as such. In ontology, however, the unpresentable occurs within a presentative forcing which disposes it as the :ref:`nothing` from which everything proceeds. The consequence is that the name of the void is a pure *proper name*, which indicates itself, which does not bestow any index of difference within what it refers to, and which auto-declares itself in the form of the multiple, despite there being :ref:`nothing` which is numbered by it.

  Whenever we attempt to express the matter of immediate experience, we find that its understanding leads us beyond itself, to its contemporaries, to its past, to its future, and to the universals in terms of which its definiteness is exhibited. But such universals, by their very character of universality, embody the potentiality of other facts with varying types of definiteness. Thus the understanding of the immediate brute fact requires its metaphysical interpretation as an item in the world with some systematic relation to it. When thought comes upon the scene, it finds the interperations as matters of practice. Philosophy does not initiate interpretations. Its search for a rationalistic scheme is the search for more adequate criticism, and for more adequate justifications of the interpretations which we perforce employ. Our habitual experience is a complex of failure and success in the enterprise of interpretation. If we desire a record of uninterpreted experience, we must ask a stone to record its autobiography. Every scientific memoir in its records of the "facts" is shot through and through with interpretation. The methodology of rational interpretation is the product of the fitful vagueness of consciounsess. Elements which shine with immediate distinctness, in some circumstances, retire into pneumbral shadow in other circumstances, and into black darkness on other occasions. And yet all occasions proclaim themselves as actualities within the flux of a solid world, demanding a unity of interpretation.

  The main source of the difficulties met with seems to lie in the following: it has not always been kept in mind that the semantical concepts have a relative character, that they must always be related to a particular language. People have not been aware that the language about which we speak need by no means coincide with the language in which we speak. They have carried out the semantics of a language in that language itself and, generally speaking, they have proceeded as though there was only one language in the world. The analysis of the antimonies mentioned shows, on the contrary, that the semantical concepts simply have no place in the language to which they relate, that the language which contains its own semantics, and within which the usual logical laws hold, must inevitably be inconsistent.

    To say what rules of grammar make up a propositional game would require giving the characteristics of propositions, their grammar. We are thus led to the question, What is a proposition? I shall not try to give a general definition of "proposition", as it is impossible to do so. This is no more possible than it is to give a definition of the word "game". For any line we might draw would be arbitrary. Our way of talking about propositions is always in terms of specific examples, for we cannot talk about these more generally than about specific games. We could begin by giving examples such as the proposition "There is a circle on the blackboard 2 inches from the top and 5 inches from the side". Let us represent this as "(2,5)". Now let us construct something that would be said to make no :ref:`sense <sinn>`, "(2,5,7)". This would have to be explained (and you could give it sense), or else you could say it is a mistake or a joke. But if you say it makes no :ref:`sense <sinn>`, you can explain why by explaining the game in which it has no use. Nonsense can look less and less like a sentence, less and less like a part of language. "Goodness is red" and "Mr. S came to today's redness" would be called nonsense, whereas we would never say a whistle was nonsense. An arrangement of chairs could be taken as a language, so that certain arrangements would be nonsense. Theoretically you could always say of a symbol that it makes :ref:`sense <sinn>`, but if you did so you would be called upon to explain its :ref:`sense <sinn>`, that is, to show the use you give it, how you operate with it. The words "nonsense' and ":ref:`sense <sinn>`" get their meaning only in particular cases and may vary from case to case. We can still talk of :ref:`sense <sinn>` without giving a clear meaning to ":ref:`sense <sinn>`", just as we talk of winning or losing without the meaning of our terms being absolutely clear.

.. epigraph::
    
  All that up to the present time I have accepted as most :ref:`true <truth>` and certain I have learned either from the senses or through the senses; but it is sometimes proved to me that these senses are deceptive, and it is wiser not to trust entirely to anything by which we have once been deceived.
  
  But it may be that although the senses sometimes deceive us concerning things which are hardly perceptible, or very far away, there are yet many others to be met with as to which we cannot reasonably have any doubt, although we recognize them by their means. For example, there is the fact that I am here, seated by the fire, attired in a dressing gown, having this paper in my hands and other similar matters. And how could I deny that these hands and this body are mine, were it not perhaps that I compare myself to certain persons, devoid of sense, whose cerebella are so troubled and clouded by violent vapours of black bile, that they constantly assure us that they think they are kings when they are really quite poor, or that they are clothed in purple when they are really without covering, or who imagine that they have an earthernware head or are nothing but pumpkins or are made of glass. But they are mad, and I should be any the less insane were I to follow examples so extravagant.
  
  At the same time I must remember that I am a man, and that consequently I am in the habit of sleeping, and in my dreams representing to myself those same things or sometimes even less probable things, than do those who are insane in their waking moments. How often has it happened to me that in the night I dreamt that I found myself in this particular place, that I was dressed and seated near the fire, whilst in reality I was lying undressed in bed! At this moment it does indeed seem to me that it is with eyes awake that I am looking at this paper; that this head which I move is not asleep, that it is deliberately and of set purpose that I extend my hand and perceive it; what happens in sleep does not appear so clear nor so distinct as does all this. But in thinking over this I remind myself that on many occasions I have in sleep been deceived by similar illusions, and in dwelling carefully on this reflection I see so manifestly that there are no certain indications by which we may clearly distinguish wakefulness from sleep that I am lost in astonishment. And my astonishment is such that it is almost capable of persuading me that I now dream.
  
  I suppose, then, that all the things I see are false; I persuade myself that :ref:`nothing <nothing>` has ever existed of all that my fallacious memory represents to me. I consider that I possess no senses; I imagine that body, figure, extension, movement and place are but fictions of my mind. What, then, can be esteemed as true? Perhaps :ref:`nothing <nothing>` at all, unless that there is :ref:`nothing <nothing>` in this :ref:`world <world>` that is certain.
  
  -- `Meditations on First Philosophy <http://www.classicallibrary.org/descartes/meditations/4.htm>`_, Rene Descartes, 1641 AD

.. epigraph::

  The universe consists of objects having various qualities and standing in various relations. Some of the objects which occur in the universe are complex. When an object is complex, it consists of interrelated parts. Let us consider a complex object composed of two parts *a* and *b* standing to each other in the relation *R*. The complex object *"a-in-the-relation-R-to-b"* may be capable of being *perceived*; when perceived, it is perceived as one object. Attention may show that it is complex; we then *judge* that *a* and *b* stand in the relation *R*. Such a judgement, being derived from perception by mere attention, may be called a "*judgement of perception*." This judgement of perception, considered as an actual occurence, is a relation of four terms, namely *a* and *b* and *R* and the percipient. The percetpion, on the contrary, is a relation of two terms, namely *"a-in-the-relation-R-to-b"* and the percipient. Since an object of perception cannot be nothing, we cannot perceive "*a-in-the-relation-R-to-b*" unless *a* is in the relation *R* to *b*. Hence a judgement of perception, according to the above definition, must be :ref:`true <truth>`. This does not mean that, in a judgement which *appears* to us to be one of perception, we are sure of not being in error, since we may err in thinking that our judgement has really been derived merely by analysis of what was perceived. But if our judgement has been so derived, it must be :ref:`true <truth>`. In fact, we may define :ref:`truth`, where such judgements are concerned, as consisting in the fact that there is a complex *corresponding* to the discursive thought which is the judgement. That is, when we judge "*a* has the relation R to *b*," our judgement is said to be :ref:`true <truth>` when there is a complex "*a-in-the-relation-R-to-b*," and is said to be *false* when this is not the case. This is a definition of :ref:`truth` and falsehood in relation to judgements of this kind.

It then becomes clear and certain to him that he does not know a sun and an earth, but only an eye that sees a sun, a hand that feels an earth; that the :ref:`world` around him is there only as representation, in other words, only in reference to another thing, namely that which represents, and this is himself.

    Upper English letters are meant to denote particular lines, whereas lowercase English letters are meant to denote indeterminate lines that are related through their rhyme scheme. 

.. important::

    The choice of π and Π to represent syllables mirrors the unstressed and stressed syllables of verses. In other words, π is meant to represent indeterminate unstressed syllables, whereas Π is meant to represent indeterminate stressed syllables. However, π is often used in a more general capacity, when the indeterminate syllable could be one that is either stressed or unstressed. It will be clear from context when π is employed in this manner. 

The variables *x*, *y* and *z* will sometimes be referred to as *syntagmic variables*, or *signs*, to stress their range over the entire domain of poetic objects. 

Uppercase-lowercase pairs of English letters are understood to be rhymes. The difference in the symbolism is the *fixed* nature of the denotation. For example, the expression *A.a.a.A* denotes one fixed line, a rhyming couplet and then the fixed line again,

    The cat on the mat
    Got large and fat
    So-and-so such that 
    The cat on the mat

The scope of a rhyme does not extend beyond a stanza, i.e. past the "+" sign. For example, in the expression "*a.b.a + a.b.a*", the rhyme in "*a*" within the first stanza does not extend to the rhyme in "*a*" within the second stanza. 

**Notation**

1. #x: A lengthened sign. 
2. ♭x: A shortened sign.  
3. x.y (**Succession**): Successive signs.
4. x-y (**Concatenation**): Concatenated signs.
5. x:y (**Delimitation**): Delimited signs.
6. x ∨ y (**Disjunction**): A sign that is either x or y.
7. x + y (**Separation**): Separated signs.
8. x∝λ : Sign containing a word. 
9. x(λ) : A sign ending in a word.  
10. (λ)x: A sign beginning with a word. 
11. x(ⲡ): A sign ending in a syllable.
12. (ⲡ)x: A sign starting with a syllable
13. x.y.x | x = z: Substitute z for x in the sign "x.y.x"

Brackets, [], are used to group operations within expressions by precedence.

To see what is meant by the distinction between *separation* and *succession*, let x = "*the fish in the dish*" and y = "*the dog on a jog*". Then x.y means,

| the fish in the dish
| the dog on a jog

Where as x + y means,

| the fish in the dish
| 
| the dog on a jog

From this, it can be see the operation of *successions* inserts a new line after the first line, whereas the operation of *separation* inserts a new line after the first line *and* before the second line, to create a blank line between them. In effect, the operation of *separation* creates stanzas, whereas the operation of *succession* creates lines. 

**Shorthand**

1. Summation: The connotation of the "+" symbol is leveraged to extend the symbolism to the "*Σ*" symbol, i.e.,

    Σ :sub:`1`:sup:`n` x :sub:`i` 

Is meant to denote a series of signs separated by blank lines. 


2. Delimitation: A *delimitation* is mainly used in reference to words or syllables, and can be seen as a shorthand for excessive concatenation. *Delimitation* denotes the insertion of *pauses* (delimiters) in between words,

    Ⲁ:Ⲃ:Ⲅ = Ⲁ-∅-Ⲃ-∅-Ⲅ

**Propositions**

∀ς: ∃x: ς = x
    All stanzas are made of lines. 

∀p: p  = Σ :sub:`1`:sup:`n` ς :sub:`i` 
    All poems are made of stanzas. 

**Examples**

    A tercet where the first and third lines rhyme.

.. topic:: Definition: Meters

    a/𝔵 :sub:`n` denotes a line in 𝔵 n-meter. 

For example, 

    (a/𝔦 :sub:`4`).(b/𝔦 :sub:`3`).(a/𝔦 :sub:`4`)

Refers to a tercet where the first and third line are written in iambic tetrameter, whereas the second line is written in iambic trimeter. In other words,

    (a/𝔦 :sub:`4`) = ⲡ :sub:`1` -Ⲡ :sub:`1` -ⲡ :sub:`2` -Ⲡ :sub:`2` -ⲡ:sub:`3` -Ⲡ:sub:`3` -ⲡ :sub:`4` -Ⲡ :sub:`4`

Note in this example the first and third line rhyme. 
The scope of a meter extends to everything contained in the parenthesis it marks. For example,

    (a.a/𝔦 :sub:`4`)

Denotes a rhyming couplet where each line is written in iambic tetrameter.

.. topic:: Definition: The Rebellious Set 

    Let :math:`A` be any set and let :math:`P(A)` be it's power set. Assume :math:`f: A \to P(A)`. The Rebellious Set, denoted R, is defined as the set which satisfies this formula,

    .. math::

        R = \{ x \in A \, \mid \, x \notin f(x) \}

.. _rebellious-set-theorem:

**Theorem** :math:`f: A \to P(A) \leftrightarrow \lvert R \rvert \geq 1`

Let :math:`P(A)` be the power set of :math:`A` (the set of all subsets of :math:`A`). Suppose there exists a bijection :math:`f: A -> P(A)`. This means every element in :math:`A` is paired with a unique subset of :math:`A`, and vice versa.

If :math:`A = \emptyset`, then its power set :math:`P(A)` contains one element, the empty set itself, :math:`P(A) = {∅}`. In this case, there's no bijection between :math:`A` and :math:`P(A)`, and the theorem holds trivially.

If :math:`A \neq \emptyset`, it must contain at least one element. Let *a* be this element. Consider the subset of :math:`A`` that contains only this element, :math:`\{a\}`. Since *f* is assumed to be a bijection, there must be some element :math:`y \in A` such that :math:`f(y) = \{a\}`.

If :math:`y = a`, then, :math:`a \in f(a)`, which contradicts the definition of :math:`B` (that is, the elements in :math:`B` are not in the set they are mapped to).

If :math:`y \neq a`, then :math:`y \notin f(y)`, which means *y* should be in :math:`B` according to its definition. Since *y* exists, :math:`B` is not empty. ∎

.. _part-whole-theorem:

**Theorem** :math:`\forall A: \lvert P(A) \rvert > \lvert A \rvert`

For the sake of contradiction, suppose there exists a bijection (a one-to-one correspondence)  :math:`f: A \to P(A)`. This means every element in :math:`A` is paired with a unique subset of :math:`A`, and vice versa.

Consider the rebellious set, 

.. math::
    
    R = \{ x \in A \, \mid \, x \notin f(x) \} 

This set :math:`R` contains all elements of :math:`A` that are not members of the subset they are mapped to by *f*. By the previous theorem, this set is non-empty. Since *f* is a bijection, there must be an element :math:`r \in A` such that :math:`f(r) = R`.

If :math:`r \in R`, then by the definition of :math:`R`, :math:`r ∉ f(r)`. But :math:`f(r) = R`, so :math:`r \notin R`, a contradiction.

If :math:`r \notin R`, then by the definition of :math:`R`, :math:`r ∈ f(r)`. But :math:`f(r) = R`, so :math:`r \in R`, again a contradiction.

The initial assumption that there exists a bijection between :math:`A` and :math:`P(A)` must be false. 

Therefore,

.. _tarski-logical-primitives:

Logical Primitives
------------------

In one of his earlier papers published in 1923, *On the Primitive Term of Logistic*, Tarksi proved all logical operations in second-order logic could be defined in terms of quantification (i.e. categorical assertions) and equivalence (i.e. substitutability). 

In doing so, Tarksi introduced a "*truth*" predicate into the meta-language of analysis. This notion of "*truth*" differs considerably from the natural conception of truth, for it treats truth as an equivalency with syntactically tautologous expressions. It becomes clear, as his definitions are made and theorems derived, that this meta-logical definition of "*truth*" is insufficient for fully elaborating the synthetic and empirical modes of truth. 

.. topic:: Definition: Truth

    "*p is true*" is equivalent to "*p*"" being equivalent to "*p*".

    .. math::

        \forall p: tr(p) \equiv (p \equiv p)

.. topic:: Definition: Assertion

    "*p is asserted*" is equivalent to "*p*"

    .. math::

        \forall p: as(p) \equiv p

.. topic:: Definition: Falsity

    "*p is false*" is equivalent to "*p*" being equivalent to "*not p*"

    .. math::

        \forall p: fl(p) \equiv (p \equiv \neg p)

In the following commentary, the predicates "*truth*", "*falsity*" and "*assertion*" should be understood operationally as predicates which satisfy these extensional definitions, and not as representatives of their colloquial interpretations.

The use of the indeterminate predicate *f(p)* in these definitions implicitly allows second-order constructs into the discourse. *f(p)*, for any *f*, is equivalent to asserting there exists an *F* such that :math:`p \in F`, where *F* is the *set* of *p*'s that have the property *f*. Predication is a sneaky way of inserting "*sets*" and "*classes*" into a language without explicitly introducing the predicates :math:`\in` and :math:`\subset`. Refer to :ref:`Frege's Law V <frege-grundgesetze>` for the ultimate consequences of abstraction.

Tarski begins the paper with a reference to a previously established result that shows logical negation can be defined using only quantification and equivalence, 

.. math::

    \forall p: (\neg p) \equiv (p \equiv (\forall q: q))

Tarski uses this theorem as a starting point to show that equivalence and quantification constitute the sole primitive terms of propositional calculus. 

However, there is an interesting *implicit* assumption being made by asserting this theorem. The validity of this theorem rests on the contradiction of the inner expression :math:`\forall q: q`. In other words, in order for this theorem to obtain, it must be the case that :math:`\forall q: q` is always false. :math:`\neg \forall q: q` is indeed true, but not unconditionally, and the conditions in which it is not true are worth considering. The essence of this distinction is given in the insight the truth being expressed in the proposition :math:`\neg \forall q: q` is of a different order than a truth that is expressed tautologically, e.g. by a pure equivalence such as :math:`\neg(p \lor q) \equiv (\neg p \land \neg q)`. 

Tautological truths are vacuous; they reveal nothing about the state of the world. A proposition such as :math:`p \lor \neg p` is a *formal* truth that depends only on the syntax of logic. It's truth is not a function of the language in which it is expressed; While the symbols :math:`\lor` and :math:`\neg` may be assigned different meanings, the resulting language will still retain an expression which expresses the fundamental logical truth given by the law of excluded middle, however cumbersome and unintuitive its symbolic representation in this hypothetical language may be.

In contrast, :math:`\neg \forall q: q` is not *necessarily* true in any language, where "*language*" is to be understood as the set of all propositions *q*. It is conceivable to imagine a language that only allows the expression of true statements, in which case, since all *q* are true, :math:`\neg \forall q: q`, a *meta*-proposition *about* the language, becomes false. 

In addition, it is conceivable to imagine a language that expresses notions other than truth-values, in which case *q* cannot be treated as an assertion of truth and the *meta*-proposition :math:`\neg \forall q: q` becomes meaningless. 

If :math:`\neg \forall q: q` is to be true, it must be the case that language given by the set of *q* is capable of expressing false statements. In other words, :math:`\neg \forall q: q` is a proposition about the semantic content of :math:`\{ q | \forall q: q \}`, in particular, it is asserting a partition of the language into those statements which are true and those statements which are false exists, and furthermore, the partition of false propositions is non-empty.

.. math::

    (\neg \forall q: q) \equiv (\exists q: \neg q)

In other words, at least one false proposition exists. While this is a pragmatic and practical assumption as far as any non-trivial language is concerned, it is nevertheless not a "free" assumption, in the sense that is automatically granted if the laws of tautology are also granted. The proposition :math:`\neg \forall q: q` cannot be unconditionally true, and so its truth depends on the particular language that is under inspection. In other words, :math:`\neg \forall q: q` is implicitly a proposition *about* propositions, namely that not all of them can be true. 

If this assumption is granted, the other logical operations can be reduced to the operations of quantification and equivalence as follows: It is well-known disjunction can be defined in terms in of implication.

.. math::

    \forall p, q: (p \lor q) \equiv (\neg p \implies q) 

Moreover, it is well-known that logical implication can be defined in terms of equivalence and conjunction,

.. math::

    \forall p, q: (p \implies q) \equiv (p \equiv (p \land q))

Therefore, if conjunction can be defined in terms of equivalence and quantification, it can be asserted all of second-order logic is contained in the operations of equivalence and quantification, since all other operations can be syllogistically defined in terms of these two primitives. With this goal in mind, Tarksi builds up in sequence the following theorems.

**Theorem** :math:`\forall p: tr(p)`
   
All propositions are equivalent to themselves. Every proposition is either true or false, whence the following truth table obtains, 

.. list-table:: 
  :header-rows: 1

  * - :math:`p`
    - :math:`p \equiv p`
  * - T
    - T
  * - F
    - T

**Theorem** :math:`\forall p: (\forall q: p \equiv tr(q)) \implies p`

All propositions that are always true implies themselves. 

For each proposition *q* in the hypothesis, the following truth table describes the possible outcomes,

.. list-table:: 
  :header-rows: 1

  * - :math:`p`
    - :math:`q`
    - :math:`q \equiv q`
    - :math:`p \equiv (q \equiv q)`
  * - T
    - T
    - T
    - T
  * - T
    - F
    - T
    - T
  * - F
    - T
    - T
    - F
  * - F
    - F
    - T
    - F

Since the hypothesis is always false exactly when *p* is false, the theorem follows from the definition of implication. 

**Theorem** :math:`\forall p, q: p \implies (p \equiv tr(q))`

All propositions imply they are equivalent to always being true. The truth table from the previous theorem can be used to verify this theorem for every possible proposition *p* and *q*.

Here is where the collapse of all true expressions into an equivalence class occurs. Truth is what aggregates the descriptive operators of language into a whole. It is what unites the propositions "2 + 2 = 4" and "Snow is white" into an equivalence. Truth, in effect, abstracts away the descriptive predicatives of a language, at least insofar as this formulation is concerned.

**Theorem** :math:`\forall p: (\forall q: p \equiv tr(q)) \equiv p`

All propositions are equivalent to being equivalent to always being true. Once again, this can be demonstrated with the previous truth-table.

Any true proposition is equivalent to any other true proposition because they are all equivalent to tautologies. Only in this desolate landscape of pure vacuity can *truth* be defined. A tautology expresses through form what is self-evident. 

Truth, however, is not a mere consequence of self-evidence. It is not wholly :ref:`a priori <a-priori-a-posteriori>`; it is constructed out of parts tautologous and parts empirical, in short it is :ref:`synthetic <synthesis>`. This realization is what led to Tarski to the insights which fueled *Concept of Truth in Formalized Languages* in 1931.   

**Theorem** :math:`\forall p,q: (\forall f: p \equiv (\forall r: p \equiv f(r)) \equiv (\forall r: q \equiv f(r))) \implies q`

The formulae :math:`\forall r: p \equiv f(r)` and :math:`\forall r: q \equiv f(r)` serve as the main content of this theorem. Therefore, to understand the theorem, these formulae must be understood. Tarski refers to the terms :math:`f(r)` as a *truth* functions. He references the work of Russell and Whitehead in elaborating the conditions that must be met to refer to a function as a *truth* function, namely,

.. math::

    \forall p, q, f: ((p \equiv q) \land f(p)) \implies f(q) 

In essence, this definition asserts that if two conditions are satisfied, then *f* may be regarded as truth-function. 

First, it must be the case *p* and *q* are indistinguishable through their truth-value. The propositions ":math:`(5 - 2) \ cdot (5 + 2) - 21 = 0`", "*Earth has one moon*", "*George Washington was the first president*", "*The Vietnam War followed the Korean War*" must all be regarded as tokens of the same type of "*truth*", i.e. a syntactic truth that may be shunted through the laws of tautology. This is a loose constraint on what propositions are to be regarded as "equivalent". The only thing that need unite propositions into a equivalency is they be regarded as true under a particular assignment. 

Second, there must be a *f* that is well-defined for *p*, e.q. :math:`x^2 \in C` ("a square is a continuous function"), "'Earth has one moon' has one subject.", "'George Washington was the first president' belongs to American History". *f* is a descriptive predicative that abstracts out of its subject a property and asserts a categorical relation with respect to it, e.g. "*All propositions of the form* ':math:`p \land q`' *are true when* :math:`p \implies q` *and* :math:`p` *are both true*" or "*Some propositions of the form* :math:`p \lor q` *are true when p is true*". 

*f* is a type of *meta-tautology*, a vacuous truth of the second order, in contrast to a first order tautology such as :math:`p \lor \neg p`. It is not a tautology *in* the language, but a tautology *about* a language. To say the subject ":math:`1+4+9+16` *is a sum of squares*" is to restate through predication what is already demonstrated through the subject. The description is reflexive. This type of analysis is reminiscent of Aristotelian reciprocals,

.. epigraph::

    We may perhaps most easily comprehend that to which a thing is related, when a name does not exist, if, from that which has a name, we derive a new name, and apply it to that with which the first is reciprocally connected, as in the aforesaid instances, when we derived the word 'winged' from 'wing' and from 'rudder' the word 'ruddered.'  For example, suppose the correlative of 'head' were to be defined as 'animal' - this would be inept and inaccurate. For animal is the correlative of 'man' or 'ox' or other things of that kind, whereas 'head' is held to be correlative to 'that which has a head'. If, therefore, we are to discover the proper correlative of 'head', we might state it as 'headed'. If, however, there were no such word as 'headed', we should have to invent one for the purpose, just as in the instances given above where we coined the words 'winged' and 'ruddered.' For 1  'wing' is relative to 'winged' and 'rudder' to 'ruddered.'

To see in detail what is meant by this definition, it instructive to analyze it through application, to understand how its meaning is built up through its components. Since the definition is being quantified over the domain of propositions, i.e. those objects which can be regarded as either true or false, it suffices to restrict attention to the possible assignments to these propositions, to see what conditions they impose through the definition on the form of the truth function :math:`f(p)`.

If *p* is true and *q* is true, then the equivalency relation in the definition holds. By the laws of tautology,

.. math:: 


If it :math:`f(p)` is false, then any assignment to :math:`f(q)` will satisfy the definition. In short, if *p* and *q* are equivalent, then the definition is equivalent to,

TODO 

If *p* is false and *q* is true, or visa versa, the equivalency relation in the definition fails to obtain. If the hypothesis of the implication is false, then the consequence may be either true or false. Thus, in these cases, any assignment to :math:`f(p)` and :math:`f(q)` will satisfy the definition.

If *p* is false and *q* is false, or if *p* is true and *q* is true, then the equivalency is true. Then, either :math:`f(p)` is true, or it is false. If it is true, then the implication is only true is :math:`f(q)` is also true. If it :math:`f(p)` is false, then any assignment to :math:`f(q)` will satisfy the definition. In short, if *p* and *q* are equivalent, then the definition is equivalent to,

.. math::

    f(p) \implies f(q)

Thus, if *p* and *q* are equivalent, **and** if :math:`f(p)` expresses a true property of *p*, then :math:`f(q)` also expresses a true property of *q*.

**Theorem** :math:`\forall p: \neg (\forall q: p \equiv as(q))`

To derive an English translation that avoids unnecessary convolutions, it must be tautologically re-expressed in a different form. Keeping in mind the laws of quantification, 

.. math::

    \neg \forall x: f(x) \equiv \exists x: \neg f(x)

This can be restated as,

.. math::

    \forall p: \exists q: p \not\equiv as(q)

Which provides an serviceable translation into English: There is no proposition which is equivalent to the assertion of all propositions. 

**Theorem** :math:`\forall p,q: (\forall r: p \equiv as(r)) \equiv (\forall r: q \equiv as(r))`

Every assertion of all propositions is equivalent to any other assertion of all propositions. 

**Theorem** :math:`\forall p, q: (\forall f: p \equiv ((\forall r: p \equiv f(r) ) \equiv (\forall r: q \equiv f(r)))) \implies p`

One proposition being equivalent to the equivalency of all equivalent properties of another proposition implies the proposition.

**Theorem** :math:`\forall p,q: (\forall f: p \equiv ((\forall r: p \equiv f(r)) \equiv (\forall r: q \equiv f(r))) ) \implies (p \land q)`

One proposition being equivalent to the equivalency of all equivalent properties of another proposition implies both propositions.

**Theorem** :math:`\forall p, q, f: (p \land q) \implies (p \equiv ((\forall r: p \equiv (fr)) \equiv (\forall r: q \equiv f(r))))`

Two propositions together imply one proposition is equivalent to the equivalency of all equivalent properties of the other proposition, 

**Theorem** :math:`\forall p,q: (p \land q) \equiv (\forall f: p \equiv ((\forall r: p \equiv f(r)) \equiv (\forall r: q \equiv f(r))))`

Two propositions together is equivalent to one proposition being equivalent to the equivalency of all equivalent properties of the other proposition.

.. _tarski-methodology-of-deductive-sciences:

Deductive Science
-----------------

In his 1930 paper *On Fundamental Concepts of the Methodology of Deductive Sciences*, Tarski began to refine his notion of truth by incorporating semantics into his constructions. Or, to more accurate, he refined his notion of truth by making the semantic assignment of truth a primitive notion. In this paper, Tarski starts by assuming the sentences under analysis have already been interpretted within the semantics of a science.

.. topic:: Definitions 

    1. :math:`S`: The set of all meaningful sentences in a science. 
    2. :math:`A`: An arbitrary subset of **S**.
    3. :math:`C_n(A)`
    4. :math:`E_{f(x)}[ ... ]`: The set of all values of the function *f* corresponding to those values of the argument *x* which satisfy the condition formulated in the brackets "[..]".
    5. :math:`\mathbb{P}(A) = E_X[X \subseteq A]`: The powerset of A, i.e. the set of all subsets of A. 
    6. :math:`\mathbb{F} = E_X[ \lvert X \rvert \leq \aleph_0]`: The set of all finite "inductive"sets.
 
With these minimalistic definitions, Tarski offers up four axioms to construct a science of science,

.. topic:: Axiom 1

    \lvert S \rvert \leq \aleph_0

.. topic:: Axiom 2

    If :math:`A \subseteq S` then :math:`A \subseteq C_n(A) \subseteq S`

.. topic:: Axiom 3

    If :math:`A \subseteq S` then :math:`C_n(C_n(A)) = C_n(A)`

.. topic:: Axiom 4

    If :math:`A \subseteq S` then :math:`C_n (A) = \sum_{X \in \mathbb{P}(A) \cdot \mathbb{F}} C_n(X)`

Upon reflection, Axiom 1 and Axiom 4 may appear to be at odds. It is instructive to highlight the tension that seems to exist between these two axioms and show the way in which this apparent tension is resolved. Axiom 1 of Tarski's deductive system asserts the set of meaningful sentences in a science is at most countably infinite. In fact, after introducing the axiom, in a brief aside, Tarski mentions in an aside that strict equality in Axiom 1 can be assumed without comprising his results. 

Axiom 4, on the other hand, states the consequences of an arbitrary subset of meaningful sentences, :math:`A`, is the sum of consequences of sets taken over finite subsets of :math:`A`. Given that Axiom 1 states that :math:`S` is potentially infinte and the hypothesis of Axiom 4 allows the case :math:`A = S`, Axiom 4 appears to state the infinite set :math:`S` is the result of a finite union. In fact, Axiom 1 and Axiom 4 taken together *do assert* an infinite set is the result of a finite union. However, it is a finite union of *consequences*, which are not necessarily finite. 

To understand the subtlety of Axiom 1 and Axiom 4, it suffices to consider

.. math::

    C_n({})

Which is to ask: what are the consequences of *nothing*? The consequences of *nothing* are exactly those propositions which are vacuously true, namely tautologies. Every tautological form generates an infinite number of tautologies through the recursive nature of the substitution principle. Take for example the law of the excluded middle, substituted into itself ad infinitum,

.. math::

    p \lor \neg p, (p \lor \neg p) \lor \neg(p \lor \neg p), ...

Thus, it is seen that even though Axiom 4 asserts an infinite set can be reduced to a finite number of unions, the terms of the union are not finite. In light of the recursive nature of tautologies, Tarski's offhand assertion regarding the infinite cardinality of :math:`S` becomes more plausible. 

**Theorem** If :math:`A \subseteq B \subseteq S`, then :math:`C_n(A) \subseteq C_n(B)`

If one corpus is contained in another corpus, then the consequences of the first corpus are contained in the consequences of the second corpus. In effect, this means the consequences of a part of a deductive science cannot exceed the consequences of the whole of a deductive science. 

By assumption,

.. math::

    A \subseteq B \implies P(A) \subset P(B)

And in turn,

.. math::

    P(A) \subseteq P(B) \implies P(A) \cdot \mathbb{F} \subset P(B) \cdot \mathbb{F}

In other words, the indices of the sum for :math:`C_n(A)` are included in the indices of the sum for :math:`C_n(B)`, meaning all of the elements in :math:`C_n(a)` are also elements of :math:`C_n(B)` but elements in :math:`C_n(B)` are not necessarily elements of :math:`C_n(A)`, whereby it follows from the definition of unions and subsets,

.. math::

    C_n(A) \subseteq C_n(B)

**Theorem** If :math:`A + B \subseteq S` then the formulas :math:`A \subseteq C_n (B)` and :math:`C_n(A) \subseteq C_n(B)` are equivalent. 

TODO

**Theorem** If :math:`A + B \subseteq S`, then :math:`C_n(A + B) = C_n(A + C_n(B)) = C_n(C_n(A) + C_n(B))`

Carnap's Method of Tautology
----------------------------

A common problem in formal logic is determining whether a given proposition is a tautology, i.e. true in all possible cases. Since the number of rows in a truth table grows exponentially with the number of propositions, the traditional method of truth tables is computationally expensive. In `Introduction to Symbolic Logic <https://archive.org/details/rudolf-carnap-introduction-to-symbolic-logic-and-its-applications>`_, Carnap presents a different method for evaluating whether or not a given proposition is a tautology. Rather than enumerating all possible cases and checking if each one is true, it suffices to show the assignment of false to a proposition is impossible. In other words, Carnap's method starts by assuming the proposition is false and then works backwards through the logical connectives to see whether or not an assignment of false is consistent with the proposition.

For example, consider the well-known property of implications,

.. math::

    ((p \implies r) \land (q \implies r)) \implies ((p \land q) \implies r) 

To determine whether this constitues a tautology, it must be shown whether or not an assignment of false can be made to the entire proposition. The proposition is built out of nested propositions. The assignment of false to entire proposition will in turn require the subformulas of the proposition to assume particular values. This will yield conditions for evaluating whether the overall assignment is consistent with the assignment of its components. The top-level connective is,

.. math::

    s \implies t 

Where :math:`s = (p \implies r) \land (q \implies r)` and :math:`t = ((p \land q) \implies r)`. 

In order for this implication to be false, the hypothesis, :math:`s`, must be true, while the consequence, :math:`t`, must be false. 

The assignment of false to :math:`t` in turn requires :math:`p \land q` to be true and :math:`r` to be false.

The assignment of true to :math:`p \land q` in turn requires :math:`p` be true and :math:`q` be true. 

Thus, it is seen in order for the proposition itself to be false, :math:`p` and :math:`q` must be true, while :math:`r` is false. 

These values, however, are inconsistent with the hypothesis, :math:`s`, which was required to be true, for :math:`p \implies r` and :math:`q \implies r` are both false under this assignment, and thus their conjunction is false. This contradicts our initial assumption that :math:`s` is true. Therefore, the entire proposition cannot be false for any assignment and it must be concluded the entire proposition is true for all possible values of :math:`p`, :math:`q` and :math:`r`.

.. math::

    \forall p, q, r: ((p \implies r) \land (q \implies r)) \implies ((p \land q) \implies r)

Metaphysics of Abstraction
--------------------------

Zalta attempted to partition the objects of a language through those that map to being actual and those that map to being abstract. 

.. topic:: Definition: Predicates 

    - Ox: *x is an ordinary individual*
    - Ax: *x is an abstract individual*
    - xF: *x encodes the property F*
    - Fx: *x exemplifies the property F* 

Ordinary individuals necessarily and always fail to encode properties.

.. math::

    \forall x: Ox \to \Box \neg \exists F: xF


For every condition on properties, it is necessarily and always the case that there is an abstract individual that encodes just the properties satisfying the condition.

.. math::

    \forall \phi: \exists x: Ax \land \Box \forall F: (xF \leftrightarrow \phi(F))


Two individuals are identical if and only if they are both ordinary individuals and they necessarily and always exemplify the same properties, or they are both abstract individuals and they necessarily and always encode the same properties.

.. math::

    \forall x: \forall y: (x =y) \leftrightarrow [ (Ox \land Oy \land \Box \forall F: (Fx \leftrightarrow Fy)) \lor (Ax \land Ay \land \Box \forall F: (xF \leftrightarrow yF))]

If it is possible or sometimes the case that an individual encodes a property, then that individual encodes that property necessarily and always.

.. math::

    \forall x: \forall F: \Diamond xF \to \Box xF


For every exemplification condition on individuals that does not involve quantification over relations, there is a property which is such that, necessarily and always, all and only the individuals satisfying the condition exemplify it.

.. math::

    \forall \phi: \exists F: \Box \forall x: Fx \leftrightarrow \phi(x)

Two properties are identical just in case it is necessarily and always the case that they are encoded by the same individuals.

    His Ennead is before him as teeth and lips, that is, the semen and hands of Atum. The Ennead of Atum came into being by his semen and fingers; the Ennead [of Ptah], however, is the teeth and lips in this mouth, which pronounced the name of everything, and from which Shu and Tefnut came forth, the fashioner of the Ennead.

    The sight of the eyes, the hearing of the ears, and the smelling of the air by the nose, they present to the heart. This is what causes every "completed [concept]" to come forth, and it is the tongue that repeats what the heart thinks.

From Chaos came forth Erebus and black Night; but of Night were born Aether and Day, whom she conceived and bore from union in love with Erebus. And Earth first bore starry Heaven, equal to herself, to cover her on every side, and to be an ever-sure abiding-place for the blessed gods. And she brought forth long hills, graceful haunts of the goddess Nymphs who dwell amongst the glens of the hills. She bore also the fruitless deep with his raging swell, Pontus, without sweet union of love. But afterwards she lay with Heaven and bore deep-swirling Oceanus, Coeus and Crius and Hyperion and Iapetus, Theia and Rhea, Themis and Mnemosyne and gold-crowned Phoebe and lovely Tethys. After them was born Cronos the wily, youngest and most terrible of her children, and he hated his lusty sire.

**400s - 300s BCE**

.. epigraph::

    Seeing that everybody, gods of the world and mankind, says that nothing existed prior to chaos, I, in distinction to them, shall demonstrate that they are all mistaken, because they are not acquainted with the origin of chaos, nor with its root. Here is the demonstration.

    How well it suits all men, on the subject of chaos, to say that it is a kind of darkness! But in fact it comes from a shadow, which has been called by the name 'darkness'. And the shadow comes from a product that has existed since the beginning. It is, moreover, clear that it existed before chaos came into being, and that the latter is posterior to the first product. Let us therefore concern ourselves with the facts of the matter; and furthermore, with the first product, from which chaos was projected. And in this way the truth will be clearly demonstrated.

    After the natural structure of the immortal beings had completely developed out of the infinite, a likeness then emanated from Pistis (Faith); it is called Sophia (Wisdom). It exercised volition and became a product resembling the primeval light. And immediately her will manifested itself as a likeness of heaven, having an unimaginable magnitude; it was between the immortal beings and those things that came into being after them, like [...]: she (Sophia) functioned as a veil dividing mankind from the things above.

    Now the eternal realm of truth has no shadow outside it, for the limitless light is everywhere within it. But its exterior is shadow, which has been called by the name 'darkness'. From it, there appeared a force, presiding over the darkness. And the forces that came into being subsequent to them called the shadow 'the limitless chaos'. From it, every kind of divinity sprouted up [...] together with the entire place, so that also, shadow is posterior to the first product. It was the abyss that it appeared, deriving from the aforementioned Pistis.

    Then shadow perceived there was something mightier than it, and felt envy; and when it had become pregnant of its own accord, suddenly it engendered jealousy. Since that day, the principle of jealousy amongst all the eternal realms and their worlds has been apparent. Now as for that jealousy, it was found to be an abortion without any spirit in it. Like a shadow, it came into existence in a vast watery substance. Then the bile that had come into being out of the shadow was thrown into a part of chaos. Since that day, a watery substance has been apparent. And what sank within it flowed away, being visible in chaos: as with a woman giving birth to a child - all her superfluities flow out; just so, matter came into being out of shadow, and was projected apart. And it did not depart from chaos; rather, matter was in chaos, being in a part of it.

    And when these things had come to pass, then Pistis came and appeared over the matter of chaos, which had been expelled like an aborted fetus - since there was no spirit in it. For all of it (chaos) was limitless darkness and bottomless water. Now when Pistis saw what had resulted from her defect, she became disturbed. And the disturbance appeared, as a fearful product; it rushed to her in the chaos. She turned to it and blew into its face in the abyss, which is below all the heavens.

    And when Pistis Sophia desired to cause the thing that had no spirit to be formed into a likeness and to rule over matter and over all her forces, there appeared for the first time a ruler, out of the waters, lion-like in appearance, androgynous, having great authority within him, and ignorant of whence he had come into being. Now when Pistis Sophia saw him moving about in the depth of the waters, she said to him, "Child, pass through to here," whose equivalent is 'yalda baoth'.

    Since that day, there appeared the principle of verbal expression, which reached the gods and the angels and mankind. And what came into being as a result of verbal expression, the gods and the angels and mankind finished. Now as for the ruler Yaltabaoth, he is ignorant of the force of Pistis: he did not see her face, rather he saw in the water the likeness that spoke with him. And because of that voice, he called himself 'Yaldabaoth'. But 'Ariael' is what the perfect call him, for he was like a lion. Now when he had come to have authority over matter, Pistis Sophia withdrew up to her light.

    [1] ἀρχῇ ἐποίησεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν. 
    
    [2] ἡ δὲ γῆ ἦν ἀόρατος καὶ ἀκατασκεύαστος, καὶ σκότος ἐπάνω τῆς ἀβύσσου, καὶ πνεῦμα Θεοῦ ἐπεφέρετο ἐπάνω τοῦ ὕδατος. 
    
    [3] καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Θεός· γενηθήτω φῶς· καὶ ἐγένετο φῶς. 
    
    [4] καὶ εἶδεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸ φῶς, ὅτι καλόν· καὶ διεχώρισεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸ φῶς, ὅτι καλόν· καὶ διεχώρισεν ὁ Θεὸς ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ φωτὸς καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ σκότους. 
    
    [5] καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸ φῶς ἡμέραν καὶ τὸ σκότος ἐκάλεσε νύκτα. καὶ ἐγένετο  ἑσπέρα καὶ ἐγένετο πρωΐ, ἡμέρα μία.

    [1] In the beginning God made the sky and the earth. 
    
    [2] Yet the earth was invisible and unformed, and darknesS was over the abyss, and a divine wind was being carried along over the water.
    
    [3] And God said, "Let light come into being." And light came into being.
    
    [4] And God saw the light, that it was good. And God separated between the light and between the darkness.
    
    [5] And God called the light Day and the darkness he called Night. And it came to be evening, and it came to be morning, day one.

.. epigraph:: 

    In nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas
    
    corpora; di, coeptis (nam vos mutastis et illas)
    
    adspirate meis primaque ab origine mundi
    
    ad mea perpetuum deducite tempora carmen!
    
    
    Ante mare et terras et quod tegit omnia caelum
    
    unus erat toto naturae vultus in orbe,
    
    quem dixere chaos: rudis indigestaque moles
    
    nec quicquam nisi pondus iners congestaque eodem
    
    non bene iunctarum discordia semina rerum.
    
    nullus adhuc mundo praebebat lumina Titan,
    
    nec nova crescendo reparabat cornua Phoebe,
    
    nec circumfuso pendebat in aere tellus
    
    ponderibus librata suis, nec bracchia longo
    
    margine terrarum porrexerat Amphitrite;
    
    utque erat et tellus illic et pontus et aer,



    sic erat instabilis tellus, innabilis unda,

    lucis egens aer; nulli sua forma manebat,

    obstabatque aliis aliud, quia corpore in uno

    frigida pugnabant calidis, umentia siccis,

    mollia cum duris, sine pondere, habentia pondus.

.. epigraph::

    I want to speak about bodies changed into new forms. You, gods, since you are the ones who alter these, and all other things, inspire my attempt, and spin out a continuous thread of words, from the world's first origins to my own time.

    Before there was earth or sea or the sky that covers everything, Nature appeared the same throughout the whole world: what we call chaos: a raw confused mass, nothing but inert matter, badly combined discordant atoms of things, confused in the one place. There was no Titan yet, shining his light on the world, or waxing Phoebe renewing her white horns, or the earth hovering in surrounding air balanced by her own weight, or watery Amphitrite stretching out her arms along the vast shores of the world. Though there was land and sea and air, it was unstable land, unswimmable water, air needing light. Nothing retained its shape, one thing obstructed another, because in the one body, cold fought with heat, moist with dry, soft with hard, and weight with weightless things.

    Hljóðs bið ek allar helgar kindir,

    meiri ok minni mögu Heimdallar;

    viltu, at ek, Valföðr! vel framtelja forn spjöll fíra,

    þau er fremst um man.


    Ek man jötna ár um borna,

    þá er forðum mik fœdda höfðu;

    níu man ek heima, níu íviði,

    mjötvið mœran fyr mold neðan.


    Ár var alda þar er Ýmir bygði,

    vara sandr né sær né svalar unnir,
    
    jörð fannsk æva né upphiminn,
    
    gap var ginnunga, en gras hvergi.


    Áðr Burs synir bjöðum um ypðu,

    þeir er Miðgarð mœran skópu;
    
    sól skein sunnan á salar steina,
    
    þá var grund gróin grœnum lauki.


    Sól varp sunnan, sinni mána,

    hendi inni hœgri um himinjódyr;

    sól þat ne vissi hvar hon sali átti,

    máni þat ne vissi hvat hann megins átti,

    stjörnur þat ne vissu hvar þær staði áttu.

.. epigraph::

    Hearing I ask | from the holy races,

    From Heimdall's sons, | both high and low;

    Thou wilt, Valfather, | that well I relate

    Old tales I remember | of men long ago.


    I remember yet | the giants of yore,

    Who gave me bread | in the days gone by;

    Nine worlds I knew, | the nine in the tree

    With mighty roots | beneath the mold.


    Of old was the age | when Ymir lived;

    Sea nor cool waves | nor sand there were;

    Earth had not been, | nor heaven above,

    But a yawning gap, | and grass nowhere.


    Then Bur's sons lifted | the level land,

    Mithgarth the mighty | there they made;

    The sun from the south | warmed the stones of earth,

    And green was the ground | with growing leeks.


    The sun, the sister | of the moon, from the south

    Her right hand cast | over heaven's rim;

    No knowledge she had | where her home should be,

    The moon knew not | what might was his,

    The stars knew not | where their stations were.

**1611 AD**

.. epigraph::

    [1] In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

    [2] And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

    [3] And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 

    [4] And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the ligth from the darkness.

    [5] And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
