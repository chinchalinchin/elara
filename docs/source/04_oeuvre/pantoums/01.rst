III: The Maze
-------------

| coming back to where we started
| things don't look the same 
| from unending maze departed
| returned to no acclaim 
| 
| thing don't look the same 
| when nothing has a name
| returned to no acclaim
| in home of what became
|
| when nothing has a name 
| then we are free to be 
| in home of what became
| of our union and decree
| 
| then we are free to be
| and so in being, to flee
| from unending maze departed
| coming back to where we started
