I: LeAnna's Pantoum
-------------------

| To begin is to make our end,
| Oh, LeAnna, of Anna's Leigh,
| Come with grin and play pretend
| The past is what we both agree.
|
| Oh, LeAnna, of Anna's Leigh,
| Despite the many faults of mine,
| The past is what we both agree
| Once marks are made on dotted line.
|
| Despite the many faults of mine,
| I'll try to love you just the same;
| Once marks are made on dotted line
| There's no one left but you to blame.
|
| I'll try to love you just the same
| But I implore you play this game:
| Pretty pretend, comely with grin;
| Our end will yet begin again.
