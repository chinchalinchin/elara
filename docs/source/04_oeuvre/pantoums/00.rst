I: LeAnna's Pantoum
-------------------

| To begin is to make an end,
| Oh, LeAnna, of Anna's Leigh,
| Come with grin and let's pretend
| The past is what we agree.
|
| Oh, LeAnna, of Anna's Leigh,
| Despite the many faults of mine
| The past is what we agree
| Once you sign the dotted line.
|
| Despite the many faults of mine
| I try to love you just the same
| Once you sign the dotted line
| There's no one left to blame.
|
| I try to love you just the same
| But I ask you play this game:
| Pretty pretend, comely with grin;
| To end is to yet begin again.
