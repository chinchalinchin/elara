II: Ode to the Heron
--------------------

| Grey Heron, why not hide from winter's ire? 
| When your hunting ground turns 
|       from flows of blue to ice,
| The ducks and geese fly south
|       As soon as first wind blows, 
| The moles they go to holes 
|       To wait alongside the mice,
| The deer disappear and 
|       Dream from a hidden cove.
| 
| Each yields in retreat what they claim in Spring.
| But no you, oh Heron!
|       Not you, oh hunter Grey!
| Stalk low over drift of snow
|       With coiled neck of spear,
| Rouse from sleep the rodents
|       And make of them your prey,
| Steam each winter breath 
|       With a speckling of fear. 
|
| Every season makes of life its shape in form. 
| The spring shapes honeysuckle
|       And the lazy chirps of thrush, 
| Summer is strawberry
|       And robin eggs of fay,
| Then autumn with the crow 
|       And pumpkin in the brush
| But winter makes but one
|       The mighty Heron Grey.
