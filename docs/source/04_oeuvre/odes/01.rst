II: Ode to the Heron
--------------------

| Grey Heron, why not hide from winter's sting? 
| When hunting ground then turns 
|       from flows of blue to ice,
| The geese and ducks go south
|       As wind begins to blow, 
| Then moles will burrow down 
|       To wait beside the mice,
| The deer though disappear,
|       their dreams in hidden coves.
| 
| All retreat and yield what they claim in Spring.
| Oh! Heron! All but one!
|       Not you, oh hunter Grey!
| Stalk low on drift of snow
|       With coiled neck of spear,
| To rouse the sleeping rats
|       And feast upon your prey,
| To steam their gasping breath 
|       With scream of speckled fear. 
|
| As seasons switch yet winter lifts your wing.
| In flocks and song most birds
|       Find mate to take to nest;
| Lone you stand, silent shore
|       Of rushing river bank;
| Your song is sung in swoop
|       With fire from beating chest,
| The selfsame flame that rises
|       In cold upon your flank. 
|
| Each season makes of life its shape to sing. 
| The Spring so shapes the buds
|       And lazy chirping thrush, 
| The summer, berry red
|       And robin eggs of fay,
| Then Autumn crows of black
|       In pumpkin laden brush,
| Yet winter makes but one,
|       The mighty Heron Grey.
