II: Ode to the Heron
--------------------

| Grey Heron, why not hide from winter's sting? 
| When your hunting ground turns 
|       from flows of blue to ice,
| The ducks and geese fly south
|       As soon as first wind blows, 
| The moles, they burrow down 
|       To wait alongside the mice,
| The deer disappear and 
|       Dream within hidden coves.
| 
| Each yields in retreat what they claim in Spring.
| But not you, oh Heron!
|       Not you, oh hunter Grey!
| Stalk low on drift of snow
|       With coiled neck of spear,
| Rouse from sleep the rodents
|       And make of them your prey,
| Steam each gasping breath 
|       With a speckling of fear. 
|
| Come warm winds, but winter yet lifts your wing.
| In flocks and song most birds
|       Find mate to take to nest;
| Lone you stand on silent shore
|       Of rushing river bank;
| Your song is sung in swoop
|       With fire from beating chest,
| The selfsame flame that rises
|       In cold upon your flank. 
|
| Every season makes of life its shape to sing. 
| The spring shapes honeysuckle
|       And the lazy chirps of thrush, 
| Summer is strawberry
|       And robin eggs of fay,
| Then autumn with the crow 
|       And pumpkin in the brush
| Yet winter makes but one
|       The mighty Heron Grey.
