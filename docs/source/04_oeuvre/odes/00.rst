I: An Ode To Autumn
-------------------

| Oh! If I could but touch an inch of Autumn
|       And measure Fall in feet,
| I might scale its depths to chart the bottom
|       and feel the Winter heat.
| Alas, no meters mark by foot the path
|       Through wooded maze of trees
|           Where leaves like love will wilt
|               In winded wake of wrath
|           In gusts blown cruel and dumb
|        To lay at feet to span each foot
| The dust each clever leaf here does become.
|
| As seasons pass and cast 
|       My bone layered into stone,
| Let August dig for me a grave in brown
|       barrow beneath her loam.
| Pray not a lover find these shards on shore
|       I am no edge to skip
|           Flung upon waves of fancy
|               But weight sunk under roar
|           Where, offset, tides will rise
|       To breach the sodden dike
| And drown with wave the lazing lovers' sigh.
|
| I was born old and grim
|           And now the chill sets in    
| And each breath is the steam
|           of Spring that wanes now thin.
