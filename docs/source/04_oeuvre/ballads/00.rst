Ballad of the Venus Flytrap
---------------------------

**Ballad of the Venus Flytrap**

| In an inn of fishermen and bawdy youth,
| Wise old Mercutio spins a lurid tale.
| As spirits gather in the growing crowd,
| Hear of a goddess seaborn in a gale.
|
| "Walk past the pearly gates of Eden,
| To the mount which feeds her bowers
| Where on the slopes of sovran Chaos 
| Pricked with poison petal flowers.
|
| "Amid the myrtle, she lays her ruby locks.
| Pilgrim audience flocks to gather round.
| One by one they kneel beneath her cloak
| To lay their gifts on the fÃªting ground. 
| 
| "From the courts of foreign suitors 
| and the harvest fields of swains,
| All come to tame her beauty,
| To ask her hand in vain."
|
| At this, a stripling voice then wavers,
| Declares with Bacchanalian glee,
| "If such beauty can be found,
| Then I shall take it all for me."
| 
| Old Mercutio pauses, tapping with his cane,
| Recalling all who came before
| Striking for the godly gloaming woods
| Now never heard from evermore.
|
| "Boy, be careful with your fingers
| When seeking out her shoulder lace
| Lest they brush upon the bosom
| Pressed to bodice in sweet embrace.
| 
| Though she look to us as human
| As the milkman's maiden daughter
| We are to her the fatted calf
| Made for nothing but the slaughter."
| 
| But warnings calm not the thoughts
| Now humming with medleys of the morrow;
| Once charmed, a goddess then relents
| To draw from him his mortal sorrows.
|
| In the morning, leaving hamlet by the sea
| Eastward where the somber garden lay
| The boy took to the floral tracts of idol
| And plucked from roadside for her a bouquet: 
|
| First the dainty rose to fill his hands 
| For he knew that, in the shades of red,
| The gods have hidden Cupid's passion 
| For those lovestruck by hand to spread.
|
| Deeper, far afield and hidden in the valley,
| The puffed bud of myrtle white 
| With tendril tears that whisper to the boy
| On the winded voice so slight:
|
| An agonizing lullaby of rending grief
| Which only gods and caged bird can sing 
| Tender-throated sung by meadow maid
| To eldritch vines around her feet in rings.
|  
| From the distance, the boy in secret spies
| Moonwater sprinkled by a maid onto roots
| Of a plant leaf'd by hungry litle mouths
| As she sings and harvests nectarine fruits. 
| 
| (... in progress ...)
|
| "It mirrors us in thickets, don't you see?
| Though fashioned differently in design
| It hungers for the stuff of life
| Just like your heart or mine."
| 
| (... in progress ...)
