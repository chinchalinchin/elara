I: Ballad of the Venus Flytrap
------------------------------

| In inn of fishermen and youth
|       Merwyn spins his tale, 
| Spirits hearing over glasses 
|       Of goddess born in gale,
| 
| "Pass the garden gates of Eden
|       Where mount-fed her bowers,
| The slopes of sovran Chaos tall
|       Poisons petaled flowers. 
|
| "In beds of myrtle, ruby locks
|       Beside her nubile form 
| Curl round her pilgrim's offering
|       Gifts to keep her warm. 
|
| "One by one, the attendants kneel
|       Beneath her cloak and veil 
| To lay their feted gifts at feet
|       And fragrance to inhale. 
|
| "From courts of foreign suitors,
|       Harvest fields of swains,
| All have come to tame her beauty
|       To ask her hand in vain."
|
| Oh! a stripling voice then wavers,
|       with Bacchanalian glee,
| "If such beauty can true be found,
|       then take it all for me."
| 
| Merywn pauses, tapping cane
|       To beat of those before
| Struck for the eastward gloaming wood
|       Never heard evermore,
|
| "Boy, be careful with your fingers
|       Seeking her shoulder lace
| Lest they brush upon the bosom
|       Pressed in sweet embrace,
| 
| "Though she look to us as human
|       Like a maiden daughter,
| We are to her the fatted calf,
|       Made for godly slaughter. 
|
| But warnings calm not the dreaming
|       Medley of the morrow:
| In songed charm, goddess kisses 
|       Away mortal sorrow.
|
| Dawning morn, he left hamlet gone
|       Eastward where garden lay 
| Floral tract to mountain valley,
|       Pluck'd roadside a bouquet.
|
| First dainty roses fill his hand,
|       For in the shaded red
| Hide the arrow-aimed passion
|       Prun'd by hand to spread.
|
| Deeper hidden still, far afield:
|       Myrtle, puff'd bud of white, 
| Thru tendril whisper to the boy 
|       On winded voice so slight: 
|
| Elegy of a life unliv'd
|       Caged bird learned sings
| Tender throat-sung by meadow maid 
|       Around her feet in rings:
|
| Queer vine of eldritch origin
|       To her voice enthralled
| Slowly snake as if magick move
|       A serpent of the auld.
| 
| From secret distance, the boy spy
|       Moonwater sprinkled root.
| Of a plant leaf'd by rows of teeth,
|       She tends half-rotten fruit. 
| 
| Awestruck, swilling of her liquor
|       Car'mel swirls brandy
| Wipes from mouth thought of goddess
|       Replac'd taste of fancy. 
|
| Bold from lack of years accrued 
|       He calls to meadow maid 
| "Hark! Why this sad refrain to sing
|       When beauty here arrays?"
|
| Spun from task, she in take of gasp 
|       Cuts off her melody-- 
| The vined teeth then curling drop 
|       As if by jealousy. 
|
| Her voice now free of elegy 
|       it tinges wrath instead,
| "What creeping spy from rosed row
|       Peeks his peeping head?"
|
| Descending steps by casted shades
|       Of clove-red fading sky,
| Falling feet spoke with the dust
|       Of sodden corpses dry. 
|
| He approaches and bows his head
|       To give his ego's lie,
| "Excuse my offense, meadow maid 
|       But passing caught my eye. 
|
| "I admit to no rarer sight
|       A dame as fair as thee 
| Attending with wat'ring can and song 
|       A plant framed by teeth. 
|
| "Closer that I draw queerer still
|       My mind descends in shock 
| The field beyond my youth and town
|       Keeps so strange a flock
|
| "What manner thing are you keeping
|       In this patch of nursery
| Stalked with fingers earthen brown
|       Yet different by such degree?
|
| (... in progress ...)
| 
| With rose in hand, now knee to ground,
| He speaks with eyes lowered from her gaze,
| "To say, madam, fate delivered me to you
| Then no lie from lips betrayed." 
| 
| (... in progress ...)
|
| "It mirrors us in thickets, don't you see?
| Though fashioned differently in design
| It hungers for the stuff of life
| Just like your heart or mine."
| 
| (... in progress ...)
