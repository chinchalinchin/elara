I: Ballad of the Venus Flytrap
------------------------------

| In inn of fishermen and youth
|       Merwyn spins his tale, 
| Spirits hearing over glasses 
|       Of goddess born in gale,
| 
| "Pass the garden gates of Eden
|       Where mount-fed her bowers,
| The slopes of sovran Chaos tall
|       Poisons petaled flowers. 
|
| "In beds of myrtle, ruby locks
|       Beside her nubile form 
| Curl round her pilgrim's offering
|       Gifts to keep her warm. 
|
| "One by one, the attendants kneel
|       Beneath her cloak and veil 
| To lay their feted gifts at feet
|       And fragrance to inhale. 
|
| "From courts of foreign suitors,
|       Harvest fields of swains,
| All have come to tame her beauty
|       To ask her hand in vain."
|
| Oh! a stripling voice then wavers,
|       with Bacchanalian glee,
| "If such beauty can true be found,
|       then take it all for me."
| 
| Merywn pauses, tapping cane
|       To beat of those before
| Struck for the eastward gloaming wood
|       Never heard evermore,
|
| "Boy, be careful with your fingers
|       Seeking her shoulder lace
| Lest they brush upon the bosom
|       Pressed in sweet embrace,
| 
| "Though she look to us as human
|       Like a maiden daughter,
| We are to her the fatted calf,
|       Made for godly slaughter. 
|
| But warnings calm not the dreaming
|       Medley of the morrow:
| In songed charm, goddess kisses 
|       Away mortal sorrow.
|
| In the morning, leaving hamlet by the sea
| Eastward where somber gardens lay
| The boy took to floral tracts of idle
| And plucked from roadside a bouquet: 
|
| First the dainty rose to fill his hands 
| For he knew that, in the shades of red,
| The gods have hidden Cupid's passion 
| For those lovestruck by hand to spread.
|
| Deeper, far afield and hidden in the valley,
| Myrtle puffed in bud of white
| With tendril tears that whisper to the boy
| On the winded voice so slight:
|
| A sober lullaby of silent spoken grief
| Which only gods and caged bird can sing 
| Tender-throated, sung by meadow maid
| To eldritch vines around her feet in rings.
|  
| From the distance, the boy in secret spies
| Moonwater sprinkled by spout to root
| Of a plant leaf'd by rows and rows of teeth
| As she melodic tends its half-rotten fruit. 
| 
| Awestruck, the boy drinks deep liquor beauty
| Swirl'd like curls of car'mel pour of brandy
| Wiped from mouth thoughts of goddess Venus
| Replac'd with new tastes of his fancy. 
|
| Bold from a lack of many learned years
| He stands and calls out to the meadow maid, 
| "Hark! Why this sad song are you singing
| When beauty's gifts around you are arrayed?"
| 
| Spun from task, she gasps, into hiding hollers,
| "What creeping spy from rosed rows 
| Wanders thru dream dark fields of yore 
| Now with questions standing grows?" 
|
| In reply, he descends in steps by shades
| Cast from the fast-fading clove-red sky,
| "Excuse my offense, oh, meadow maid, 
| But in passing, you caught my eye. 
|
| "I admit there is no rarer sight
| Stumbling upon a dame as fair as thee 
| Who attends with wat'ring can and song 
| A plant plainly made of teeth.
|
| "Closer as I draw, queerer still I feel
| What manner of thing can this it be 
| Stalked with fingers brown-Earth-green
| Yet so different by multiplied degree?"
|
| (... in progress ...)
| 
| With rose in hand, now knee to ground,
| He speaks with eyes lowered from her gaze,
| "To say, madam, fate delivered me to you
| Then no lie from lips betrayed." 
| 
| (... in progress ...)
|
| "It mirrors us in thickets, don't you see?
| Though fashioned differently in design
| It hungers for the stuff of life
| Just like your heart or mine."
| 
| (... in progress ...)
