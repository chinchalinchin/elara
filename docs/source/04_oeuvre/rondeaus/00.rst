I: A Youthful Rondeau
---------------------

| With pockets full of paper, youth has made him bold
| Stories that they tell him, myths of men grown old,
| Fall upon his entralled ears without even a receipt
| And in forgotten failures, every choice will repeat
| Until in devil dealings, for a meager ounce of gold, 
| Soul exchanged in secret for a subtler, sweeter meat 
|                           With pockets full of paper.
|
| No need for prophecy when street corners all foretold
| Every end will make its end with the necessary cold 
| To find himself outside alone, sleeping on the street 
|                           With pockets full of paper.
|
| So he ends where he begins, from on the stoop extolled
| The vital wages of his sin, of which virtues to uphold
| But no one listened, cared not to hear of his conceits
| So rambling, raving, soul-consumed, he brayed and bleat
| Until from empty funeral his corpse in coffin rolled
|                          With pockets full of paper.
