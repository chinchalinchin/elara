I: Elemental Elegy
------------------

| Newspaper read by death's grey bed,
| I told a story both green and true
| Of city bricks stacked proud and red
| Of silver paths the stars imbue
| With golden hue we might have tread.
| Your breath though blows now cold and blue.
|
| I spoke the words to yellow skin
| And told of days in white to come.
| Your mouth, with specks of purple grin,
| And fingers stretched so pale and numb,
| My name, you said, so clear, so thin--
| With final grasp, in black succumbs.
| 
| Oh--Father, Father--bronze horns blare!
| You string your harp with copper thread
| And leave in me this slate despair!
| What crystal tears in eyes now shed?
| What pearl is formed by sightless stare?
| What platinum found in prayers pled?
