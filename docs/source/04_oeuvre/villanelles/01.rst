II: The Haunted Cathedral
-------------------------

| A church atop a steepled hill
| From foundation ages old 
| Remains in spirit standing still.
| 
| Stain'd glass shattered on a sill,
| With marble halls of lichen mold,
| A church atop a steepled hill. 
|
| From pews drinking up their fill,
| The congregation in stories told
| Remains in spirit standing still.
|
| What there remains but little will
| In history pages to written hold
| A church atop a steepled hill.
|
| But steeple of such pointed skill,
| From silken skies of glitter'd gold
| Remains in spirit standing still. 
|
| Pray, ignore the biting chill
| As cast into the shaping mould,
| Oh! church atop a steepled hill, 
| We remain in spirit standing still.
