IV: Plots
---------

| In time their plot was touched by dark.
| Began the page this meadow scene
| where blades of grass were tall and stark.
| 
| A tired arc, they met in park
| To kiss beneath the twilight queen;
| In time their plot was touched by dark.
| 
| They stole away on sudden lark,
| Exchanged the words from whispered lean
| Where blades of grass were tall and stark.
| 
| So happy and green, neighbors remark,
| Yet seem is such to lose its sheen,
| In time their plot was touched by dark. 
| 
| Yet faded years ignored their spark
| In death they died forever seen
| Where blades of grass were tall and stark.
| 
| In ground, their bodies disembark
| And leave behind a hole dug clean.
| In time their plot was touched by dark,
| Where blades of grass were tall and stark.
