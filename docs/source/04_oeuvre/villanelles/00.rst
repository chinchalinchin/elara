I: The Villanelle of Viola Elle
-------------------------------

| Viola Elle took his heart
| But there wasn't much to take
| Strewn to pieces and to parts. 
|
| The written word her counterpart
| In those blossoms caught his love
| And Viola Elle took his heart.
| 
| So brief her stay to long depart,
| Meadow memories of clover doves
| Strewn to pieces and to parts. 
| 
| Without hand and leading start
| To silent fields of fell foxglove
| Viola Elle took his heart
| 
| And in taking, sorrow did impart
| The waking of his life whereof
| Strewn to pieces and to parts. 
| 
| In form such beauty is betrayed;
| From pen she never fully fades.
| Viola Elle took his heart
| Strewn to pieces and to parts.
