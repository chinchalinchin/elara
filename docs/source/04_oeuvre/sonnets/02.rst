III: Sonnet to Cumberland
-------------------------

| City struts by bay side through time accrue
| Into westward coursing concrete current
| Sweeping forest then by sky to strait in flue
| To meet mount top a steeple cloaked in snow,
| Splashed upon the Appalachian spine
| Where pools in valleys deep drink their fill.
| Watch what sprouts in shoots through shouldered pine
| As from houses empty crowds on street do spill
| Through hand to hand the layers stacked from base
| To brick by brick til building lillies bred
| Against the westward wall in flood's embrace
| Where lips at last are wet in watershed:
| 
| Let skyline mark where tide in climb was broke,
| Steeple, roof, needles pine and leaves of oak.
