III: Sonnet to Cumberland
-------------------------

| City struts by bay side through time accrue
| Into west rushing streams of concrete flow,
| Sweep the forest then skyward up in spew
| To meet mount top a steeple cloaked in snow
| Splashed upon the Appalachian spine
| Where Time stands in silence devoutly still,
| Watch what sprouts in shoots through shouldered pine
| As from houses empty crowds on street to spill
| Through hand to hand the layers stacked from base
| To brick by brick the building blossoms bred
| Against the westward wall in flood's embrace
| Where lips at last are wet by watershed:
| 
| Let skyline mark where tide in climb was broke,
| Steeple, roof, needles pine and leaves of oak.
