III: Sonnet to Cumberland
-------------------------

| City struts by bay side from time accrue
| Into west rushing streams of concrete flow,
| Wash through forest then skyward up in spew,
| Meet on mount top a steeple cloaked in snow
| 
| Braced upon the Appalachian spine
| Where Time stands in silence devoutly still,
| Watch what sprouts in shoots through shouldered pine
| As from houses empty crowds through street to mill
|
| Through hand from hand the levels rise at pace
| To brick from brick the buildings blossom red
| Against the westward wall in flood's embrace
| Where in lips at last lyric words are shed:
| 
| Let skyline mark where tide in climb was broke,
| Steeple, roof, needles pine and leaves of oak.
