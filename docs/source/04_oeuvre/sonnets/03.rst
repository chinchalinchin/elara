IV: Chance
----------

| A death in six is face of die on roll,
| Like stacks of chips from pots that ante all,
| A win, or loss, of game that wagers soul
| Must meet on board the fates that follow call.
|
| A life received as hand of cards on deal,
| Where threes are flush, but royals rarely draw 
| And twos deceive, in bluff contrive to steal
| What kings and queens through rule so reap by law. 
|
| A love is tracked by loops of racing course,
| Through hoop and holler, bookies taking bets,
| Where hopes in coin distill to choice of horse
| And ticker tape leaves the crowd with debts.
|
| The world at large is made of game and rule,
| Appears to eyes as ordered step of dance.
| Each move, when made by foot of sage or fool,
| Results in taps resolved to beat of chance. 
|
| What always fortune finds is fettered fate
| Unlocked by strike of luck and never late.
