Regret
------

| Regret, she dances, with her ever rhythm'd heart
| Over silent stones during midnight mercurial;
| In darkness sway, she swoons
| As sharpened shoulders slouch.
|
| Over flowing graves, the pale wraith weaves
| her steps, for each life entombed provides
| a section orchestra
| raising as she struts. 
|
| Hollow hands hold out a beating drum to hear;
| In steady words, her lover's dirge is heard: 
| Tomorrow and tomorrow
| Until tomorrow is no more.
|
| There she spins, twirling arms,
| A specter in the moon,
| geometries of momentary
| Incandescent form.
|
| Oh, but for a single second more!
| Alas, the fleeting minutes flow. 
| She harmonizes with borrowed hours,
| Singing solemn songs.  
|
| The morning never comes;
| She flutters all the while.
| Eternal are the steps
| Of Regret's hypnotic moon-lit dance.
