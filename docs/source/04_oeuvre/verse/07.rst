Metaphor
--------

| Pretend you were a poem
| Pretend I were a poet
| If there were a place to roam,
| Would you even know it?
|
| Imagine you a word.
| Imagine me the spoken sound.
| If to lips you're lured,
| Would yourself or me be found?
|
| Picture me as paint.
| Picture yourself geometry. 
| In the stroking color faint,
| Do you seek our symmetry?
|
| If you were given only form, 
| I'd make your meaning sing, 
| Draw from cold the warm,
| From the Winter waking Spring.
