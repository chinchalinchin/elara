V: Games of Chance
------------------

| A death is face of die on roll,
|   A stack that antes all.
| To win requires a wagered soul
|   To meet and make the call.
|
| A life is hand of cards on deal,
|   Where royals rarely draw.
| The twos in bluff contrive to steal
|   What aces reap by law.
| 
| A love is tracked by racing course,
|   With bookies taking bets,
| Where hopes distill to choice of horse
|   And leave the crowds with debts.
|
| The world is framed by game and rule,
|   As if an ordered dance.
| Each move, though played by sage or fool,
|   Results in whims of chance.
|
| What fortune finds is fettered fate,
| Unlocked by luck and never late.
