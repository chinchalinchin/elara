V: Games of Chance
------------------

| A death is face of die on roll,
|   A stack that antes all.
| To win requires a wagered soul
|   To meet and make the call.
|
| A life is hand of cards on deal,
|   Where royals rarely draw.
| The twos in bluff contrive to steal
|   What aces reap by law.
| 
| A love is tracked by racing course,
|   With bookies taking bets,
| Where hopes distill to choice of horse
|   And leave the crowds with debts.
|
| The world is framed by game and rule,
|   As if an ordered dance.
| Each move, though played by sage or fool,
|   Results in whims of chance.
|
| What fortune finds is fettered fate,
| Unlocked by luck and never late.

**As A Sonnet**

| A death in six is face of die on roll,
| A slid in stack from bet that antes all,
| To win, or lose, a game that wagers soul
| Must meet on board the fates that follow call.
|
| A life received is hand of cards on deal,
| Where threes are flush, but royals rarely draw 
| And twos deceive, in bluff contrive to steal
| What kings and queens through rule so reap by law. 
|
| A love is tracked by loops of racing course,
| Through hoop and holler, bookies taking bets,
| Where hopes in coin distill to choice of horse
| And ticker tape leaves the crowd with debts.
|
| The world at large is made of game and rule,
| Appears to eyes as if an ordered dance.
| Each move, when played by hand of sage or fool,
| Results for certain whimsy, folly, chance. 
|
| What always fortune finds is fettered fate
| Unlocked by strike of luck and never late.
