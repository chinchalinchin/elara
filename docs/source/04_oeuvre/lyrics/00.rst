I: Wine
-------

| What flows is not what flows
|     But wine from sight concealed,
| Present spilling o'er lips
|     From barrel cork unsealed. 
| Agony! Of moment's time
|    To pour from heart to lung,
| Distilled to simple words
|    In verse's twisted tongue. 
| Of vine and light that grew
|    the fruit of form to fill,
| There lingers aftertaste
|    but lacks a certain frill.
| In drip of character 
|    glasses tipped to brim,
| Imbibed from ear to ear 
|    where thoughts attempt to swim,
| The meaning drowns in drink
|    Of hint of sought intent,
| But flavor cannot capture
|    What truly palette meant.
