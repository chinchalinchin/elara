III: The Origin of Wind
-----------------------

| The shape of wind in blades of grass,
|     Invisible heartbeat,
| I watch your dance from windowed room
|    In rising summer heat,
| Your pressured pulse that skips through sky
|     With history unseen,
| I wonder where this prologue starts,
|     what ancient chorus scene
| Announced your birth on fertile Earth
|    and blew the trumpet loud;
| Who called to you from great beyond
|    to tend this court of cloud?
| What moment did you rise to life? 
|    What second do we praise? 
| Your source, like form, is hidden close
|    In foggy, timeless haze. 
| In tracing back your tangled threads
|     they twine around and spool;
| Each point begins with points before
|     Always as if by rule.
