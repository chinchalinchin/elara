VIII: Eternally
---------------

| What thoughts are these that think of you 
|   Through hours alone by nights? 
| The ones in sleep through dreams ensue 
|   In verse awake incites.
|
| Asleep I fall to land at feet
|   And praise what fortune hands.
| Awake I jump to fly with beat 
|   As wing in flight expands. 
|
| If woven words could win your gaze,
|   A poem latch turnkey,
| Then cast to depths with me ablaze 
|   To write eternally.
