Of timeless things beware:
      In time they are deployed.
Each time with timeless care,
      In time they are destroyed.
No emperor or clown 
      Hath heard this bird once sing,
For history had not
      The eyes to see its wing.
Engine whine deep through night,
     When cities haunt the stars.
Ahead a stretch of road 
     With not one sign of cars.
To press the gas and hear
     The pistons roar with rage,
Closer to heaven's gate
     Than song of bird in cage.
