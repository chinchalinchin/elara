II: Sunday Ghosts
-----------------

| On Sunday morning drive for your
|   Mountain cemetery,
| From black of road there rose the mists
|   To west where winds carry. 
| The ghosts the ground have failed to keep
|   Where earth lay bare through tar,
| Where oaks and willows reach to weep
|   But watch aghast afar. 
| Decades through pores now poured in droves
|   As over them I drove,
| Their grasping tongues of fog unfurled,
|   With craft a road they wove,
| Until no longer did I drive but flee
|   From lane of memory.
