ό ποιητα, ἢ πῖθι ἢ ἄπιθι
------------------------

| I
| 
| Awake, Philosopher, rise from these words:
| Unwind in this future the tangle of time,
| Pitched behind pupils which shelter your mind,
| A dead language spoken and once lovely sung;
| What was yours only now graces all tongues. 
| 
| Burrow into my heart, unearth its mantle. 
| Tally its hours, each stroke lights a candle;
| Number its sorrows as sureties to borrow,
| Spare not my marrow, fallow and frail.
| Whose spirit is this, twisting here twung? 
| Breathe in this fire with thy mortal lung.
| 
| Circle your sigils with salted symbols loan'd,
| And circles will square in this iron-red bone;
| A dream kiss that lingers in copper and crimson,
| A dream dew that swells under circling suns,
| A bud without season, never planted yet grown,
| In the sprout sprung, all things can be shown.
|
| All centers are fire, all orbits are ice,
| All points meet their center with marks imprecise
| The world is spoked in words of the spoken,
| Each whisper a lie of threaded truth unbroken,
| Met here now in this slipping handful of tokens
| Paid for the price of this thrice-worlded poem. 
|
| II
| 
| Forgive, Father, the blood of these swords:
| Unbind in this suture the end of all lines, 
| Stitched in this present the essence divine,
| Take what is dull and bless it with sharp;
| Plunge this devotion into the ocean of hearts.
| 
| Shovel the grave, pack it down with wet earth,
| All things tend towards the lack and the dearth;
| Slumber in barrows the marrows of kings,
| Spared not the gavel, hallow and hail.
| Whose mind is this, thinking these thoughts?
| Sleep in the mire which thy heart has wrought. 
| 
| Birthed in this house, scrubbed down in raw lye,
| So these tears may trace the dead with the die,
| The dead kiss with fingers of copper to scry
| The dead lists that swell in the crimson of lives,
| An end without reason, never sought yet found,
| In the shot sung, all arcs meet the ground.
| 
| No fires have ice, no winters can flame,
| Son followed father, their center now framed,
| The world is found in the tears that remind him,
| Each moment a painting, a song or a hymn,
| Met there then in the words etched in stone
| Found then what lacks in the blackening moan.
| 
| III
| 
| Balance, Lover, these contraries of yours:
| Shine in these eyes the ruptures of life,
| Witched into worlds upon the blade of a knife;
| All wagers distill down to one move unproven,
| To find you again in this web-woven movement. 
|
| Dance in the night, when the music is sundered,
| Count not the stars that belong to the numbers.
| We find in this time the rhymes of our kind,
| Spared not the sickle, those sickly or hale.
| Whose voice is this, singing these songs?
| Laugh with the liar whose heart sings along.
| 
| Uncross your words of their fire-forged knots,
| And each will unlatch the thatches of thought:
| The dread kiss that coppers balance with nought,
| The dread song that cradles the crimson in crofts,
| A vow without treason, never spoken yet shown, 
| By words of wordless wonder, such things can be grown.
|
| All fires are embers, all ashes are white,
| To find is to lose the center in flight,
| The world found in threads that bind always thus,
| Each fiber of moment knotted deftly in truss,
| Take hand and guide as though only you and I trust,
| Do what we will to balance world's thrust.
