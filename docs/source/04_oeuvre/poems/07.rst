The Paronymous Polpytotons of Love 
----------------------------------

| I am an am that was an is,
|   the life those lives through living live.
| The songs that sing which singers sung 
|   With strings that stringed lutes have strung,
| Where cloven clefts with leaves of clove
|   Which weft of weave with warp so wove,
| On evening eve, the eave of eyes,
|   where rows of rose began to rise,
| To see she seeds her sight with seas
|   


| I sang a song the singing sung,
|   While stringing strings so stringed strung.
| I cleaved a cleft that cleaving clove, 
|   in divey dive where diving dove. 
| I eyed an I that eying eyes
|   from prior pries of prying prize. 
| She saw the seed of seeing sight
|   and lit the lighted lighting lights.
| The fleeing fled and flew in flood
|   as blooded bleeding bled their blood,
| Unstaid she stayed so staying stays
|   she said to say what saying says. 
| We worked the work that working wrought
|   to buy by buying by the bought.
| We shine in sheen what shining shone,
|   to bind what's bound in binding bone. 
| We die the deaths the dying died
|   To lay the lie where laying laid. 
| I is an am that is a were.
|   I whirled a world that whirling whirs.
