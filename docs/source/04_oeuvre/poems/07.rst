The Paronymous Polpytotons of Love 
----------------------------------

| I am an am that was an is,
|   the life those lives through living live.
| The songs that sing what singers sung 
|   With strings when stringed lutes were strung,
| Where cloven clefts with leaves of clove
|   The weft of weave with warp so wove,
| On evening eve, the eave of eyes,
|   where rows of rose began to rise,
| There seeing seized to see the sight
|   that lit up lightened like a light:
| She shined in sheen and shining shone
|   In binding bound beneath my bone.
| In fleeing flight we flew in flood
|   as blooded bleeding bled their blood,
| The deaths the dying died before 
|   were laid to lie by lying score. 
| I is an am that is a were
|  That whirled a world to whirl with her.
