The Paronymous Polyptotons of Love 
----------------------------------

| "πτερωτὸν τῷ πτερῷ πτερωτὸν ῥηθήσεται."
|    - Categories, 7.15, Aristotle
|
| I am an am that was an is,
|   a life those lives through living live,
| The song that sang what singers sung 
|   When strings from stringed lutes were strung,
| Where cloven clefts with leaves of clove
|   The weft of weave with warp so wove.
|
| On evening eve, the eave of eyes,
|   where rows of rose began to rise,
| There seeing seized to see the sight
|   that lit up lightened like a light:
| She shined in sheen and shining shone
|   In binding bound beneath my bone.
|
| At last her lashes lashed to mine,
|   a tale, though old, retold in time,
| What sooth to say through spoken sound
|   but growths of green from growing ground? 
| In fleeing flight we fled in flood
|   and bled so bleeding blends our blood.
| 
| The rote of rite has written soul
|   That hides in whole the hidden hole.
| We wound our wounds for winds unwind
|   To find defined a finer find. 
| We is an are that was a were
|  That whirled a world to whirl with her.
