The Belle of the Library
------------------------

| Lindsey the Librarian,
| Don't be so contrarian
| Go to the ball with me. 
|
| Oh, take off your glasses
| And my burly brasses
| Beneath the old oak tree. 
|
| Lindsey the Librarian
| Become an agarian
| Buckstep into my heart.
|
| Oh, double toe tap clog 
| And follow fiddle jog 
| Past bales of hay and cart. 
|
| Lindsey the Librarian 
| Never a barbarian
| Even as years grow long. 
| 
| Oh, shuffle dresses white
| For your hospital tights
| Write me a sad love song. 
|
| Lindsey the Librarian
| Died of ovarian
| Leaving my do-si un-do'd.
