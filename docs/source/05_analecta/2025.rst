There are two mutually exclusive categories of :ref:`palindromes <definition-4-1-1>` in any language: perfect and imperfect. 

A :ref:`perfect palindrome <definition-4-1-2>` is symmetric, by which it is meant a :ref:`perfect palindrome <definition-4-1-2>` may be reversed character-wise. Of the "species" of :ref:`palindromes <definition-4-1-1>` in any given language, they are the most rare, because their grammatical conditions are so stringent (at least as far as English is concerned). Counter-intuitively, this makes them the easiest to construct. 

:ref:`Perfect palindromes <definition-4-1-2>` mostly hinge on :ref:`invertible <invertible-words>` grammatical structures embodied in the "*on-no*", "*now-won*" and "*saw-was*" invertible pairs. Without these invertible pivot points, a :ref:`perfect palindromes <definition-4-1-2>` must rely on the symmetry of a central :ref:`palindromic word <reflective-words>`. In other words, the cardinality of :ref:`perfect palindromes <definition-4-1-2>` is related to the cardinality of :ref:`invertible words <invertible-words>` and the cardinality of purely :ref:`reflective words <reflective-words>`.

:ref:`Imperfect palindromes <definition-4-1-3>`, by contrast, degrade under reversal. Consider cases like "*borrow or rob*" or "*name now one man*" which, while palindromic, do not preserve semantic content when reversed. However, by dropping the delimiting character, namely the space " ", the palindromicity can be reconstructed in a degenerate alphabet, e.g. "*borroworob*" and "*namenowoneman*" are palindromic strings in an alphabet with no delimiting characters.

These observations suggest an algebraic structure exists embedded within linguistics. Let :math:`\zeta` be a sentence, defined as a sequence of characters. Then, define the :ref:`inverse <string-inversion>` of a sentence, :math:`inv(\zeta)`, as the reversal of :math:`\zeta`'s characters. Furthermore, define the :ref:`reduction <definition-3-1-2>` of a sentence, :math:`\varsigma(\zeta)`, as the string which results from the removal of delimiter characters from :math:`\zeta`. Then, palindromes, :math:`\zeta_p` can be defined mathematically as the sentences whose reduced forms are equal to their own inverses,

.. math::

    \varsigma(\zeta_p) = inv(\varsigma(\zeta_p))

It can be shown that inversion and reduction, which are string operations, commute over strings, so the above equation can be extended,

.. math::

    \varsigma(\zeta_p) = \varsigma(inv(\zeta_p)) = inv(\varsigma(\zeta_p))

In other words, palindromes, perfect and imperfect, are exactly the class of sentences which satsify this formal constraint.

**Hysteron Proteron**: An expression in which what should come last is put first.

This :ref:`poetical device <syntagmics>` is unique amongst the others insofar that it is semantic. Most devices, like epistrophe or chiasmus, are syntactical and formal; while they can be employed to enhance the meaning of a sentence, they are all nevertheless defined solely by the transposition and application of grammatical rules. In contrast, a Hysteron Proteron is a form of word play that requires more than just symbol shunting. Its essence involves the interpretation of its component parts which simultaneously places them into a contradictory whole.
