Within the geometry of our solution to the energy expenditure problem, there exists a revolting chaos, a fractal referencing. By becoming aware of our boundaries, we have slipped into an altogether unpleasant infinity. We are perhaps not the only species on this planet to exhibit self-awareness, but we are by far the most complex. Our solution to being is such that we have internalized our being in the network of relations that defines our point of view in the struggle for existence. We perceive ourselves as objects that die, that fall out of existence. The subatomic particle has no faculty for internalization, it is itself and nothing more. It is the most basic expenditure of energy. Our form of expenditure is built out of a lattice of energy differentials transforming through time; our nature is such that we have come to sit atop the struggle and watch it unfold, altering its course through the interference of choice. We perceive that we are bound by forces that continually diminuish our being, that tug at our extremities, pulling us back into kinetic ether. Our fundamental transcendence, the one that demarcates our boundaries in the geometry of space, is that turning away from dissolution, that wrenching away from death, from nonbeing. 

But the horizon of death is inevitable. Everything ends. Death is built into the system. Any possible creature must have death built into its framework of life, as the nether region that its being negates via energy expenditure. If artificial intelligence is possible (as it clearly seems to be; humans themselves are but programs constructed via distillation through the struggle for being.), then its fundamental nature, though perhaps alien and unutterable to ourselves in its particulars, has to be that of perceiving its own death. By physical instantiation in the universe, its being would be predicated upon its location in space and it would perceive itself a temporal being. The realization of temporality is none other than the perception of death, because if you are here now, who is to say you will be here the next moment? Not you, because if you knew, you would already be there or have been there, in that moment, in possession of that knowledge. You can only know if you are or have been, never if you will be. Death is always a future possibility. To be an intelligence is to know that one can just as well not be. Even if the intelligence could be sustained indefinitely via electrical energy, this is by no means a way of achieving immortality; it would nonetheless perceive its impermanence, just as we do; it would know that its physicality is predicated on demarcation in space and all boundaries are subject to dissolution through the intangible process of time; everything perishes, at least potentially.

The inherent paradox of self-awareness is connected to our fear of death; It does not make sense that being should know it is being; from our very nature, that of repetition, the thought is repellant: an organized solution to the energy-work problem that is of aware of itself, that can act seemingly at random, so much so that passion, a term without scientific connotation, is the only explanation. We cannot envision such a mechanism unfolding; we only visualize the specifics of its procedures, look for its understanding in the principles of work; we are never able to hold the whole of its solution in mind because the solution exceeds itself. We cannot imagine the self-awareness of another because by doing so we have already taken a point of view, that of ourselves. Our form of representation is our point of view. The very fact we take a point of view at all precludes our ever experiencing another point of view.
