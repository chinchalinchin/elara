| O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been
|   Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth,
| Tasting of Flora and the country green,
|   Dance, and Provençal song, and sunburnt mirth!
| O for a beaker full of the warm South,
|   Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,
|       With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,
|           And purple-stained mouth;
|   That I might drink, and leave the world unseen,
|       And with thee fade away into the forest dim:
|
| Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget
|   What thou among the leaves hast never known,
| The weariness, the fever, and the fret
|   Here, where men sit and hear each other groan;
| Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs,
|   Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;
|       Where but to think is to be full of sorrow
|           And leaden-eyed despairs,
|   Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,
|       Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.
|
| Away! away! for I will fly to thee,
|   Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,
| But on the viewless wings of Poesy,
|   Though the dull brain perplexes and retards:
| Already with thee! tender is the night,
|   And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,
|       Cluster'd around by all her starry Fays;
|           But here there is no light,
|   Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown
|       Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.
|
| I cannot see what flowers are at my feet,
|   Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,
| But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet
|   Wherewith the seasonable month endows
| The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild;
|   White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine;
|       Fast fading violets cover'd up in leaves;
|           And mid-May's eldest child,
|   The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine,
|       The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.
|
| Darkling I listen; and, for many a time
|   I have been half in love with easeful Death,
| Call'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme,
|   To take into the air my quiet breath;
|       Now more than ever seems it rich to die,
|   To cease upon the midnight with no pain,
|       While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad
|           In such an ecstasy!
|   Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain—
|           To thy high requiem become a sod.
|
| Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!
|   No hungry generations tread thee down;
| The voice I hear this passing night was heard
|   In ancient days by emperor and clown:
| Perhaps the self-same song that found a path
|   Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,
|       She stood in tears amid the alien corn;
|           The same that oft-times hath
|   Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam
|       Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.
|
| Forlorn! the very word is like a bell
|   To toll me back from thee to my sole self!
| Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well
|   As she is fam'd to do, deceiving elf.
| Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades
|   Past the near meadows, over the still stream,
|       Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep
|           In the next valley-glades:
|   Was it a vision, or a waking dream?
|       Fled is that music:—Do I wake or sleep?

Mad Girl's Love Song
--------------------

| I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead;
| I lift my lids and all is born again.
| (I think I made you up inside my head.)
|
| The stars go waltzing out in blue and red,
| And arbitrary blackness gallops in:
| I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.
| 
| I dreamed that you bewitched me into bed
| And sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane.
| (I think I made you up inside my head.)
| 
| God topples from the sky, hell's fires fade:
| Exit seraphim and Satan's men:
| I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.
| 
| I fancied you'd return the way you said,
| But I grow old and I forget your name.
| (I think I made you up inside my head.)
| 
| I should have loved a thunderbird instead;
| At least when spring comes they roar back again.
| I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.
| (I think I made you up inside my head.)
