XI: Landscapes
--------------

| Oh, hapless world, the butcher's block, 
|   The sickle, scythe, harpoon, 
| The barren fields, the culled livestock, 
|   The blood red harvest moon. 
|
| The ocean deep, a darkened heart,
|   A sore that festers cold, 
| A slumbered age, a violent art,
|   Into all things behold.
|
| The forests wild, the stalking hunt,
|   The arrow cut from stone, 
| The bloody rib, the brutal grunt,
|   A death in whimpered groan. 
|
| The mountain peaks, a falling height,
|   The air in sky dissolved, 
| A winter wind, a bitter blight, 
|   Let no sin be absolved. 
|
| The city streets, the graveyard paths,
|   The linen beds of wards, 
| The gowns of white, the final baths,
|   The oak in coffin boards.
