XII: Lullaby
------------

| Dear child, the monsters under bed, 
|   Are not just fantasy.
| They lurk in shadows overhead
|   Among us earnestly.
|
| Dear sweetling, sleep with open eye
|   To watch the dance of night.
| Ignore your mother's lullaby,
|   With candle burning bright.
|
| Beware the lair that closets hide,
|   The racks of their disguise,
| The suits and ties, the cuffs that slide
|   And cloak them from your eyes.
