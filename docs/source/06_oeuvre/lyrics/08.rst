IX: Designs (Librarian VI)
--------------------------

| If asked this time, design a rhyme
| To woo your mind from book, by hook
| I'll thread this line up steep incline
| While looking back to meadowbrook 
| Reclined your arms in sun shook shine,
| In paper pages overtook
| Your gaze from mine, hidden through pine
| I spied your beauty's lounging look.
|
| The joy of snaps and clicking lock
| Which ticking clocks with clapping hands
| So slap the sand and quickly block 
| The falling grains, in wick expands
| To flame the brand that marks the spot
| Where stopped my heart its lonely gland
| At sight of you and tamed my thought 
| And swapped unplanned in place to stand
| Where lace with liquid grace ties knots 
| Between the space your face commands.
