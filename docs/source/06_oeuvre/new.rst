With ink of jet, she shapes her world
    With written, colored line,
So contrary, she twists and twirls
    In library of mine.

Around her arm, the ink in coil
    Will paint the scene to set.
Her skin is seared with burning oil
    Where art in flame is met. 

Then up her neck, through nest of hair,
    Where color threads are knit,
The ink will bind in dye its share
    Of strands she formed by writ.

She flocks the books across the shelves
    and tends her paper field,
Her mind through story page so delves  
    as word to ink does yield.
