II: Sonnet for the Demented
---------------------------

| There are but few who taste the hemlock blue,
| Fortune finds those who swing from noose and nail;
| With minute gone they follow through in queue,
| Spared the with'ring touch of Time's fingers frail. 
| 
| If a choice it has, Time first stalks the mind, 
| Steady quick but not so fast to spook its prey;
| Every hunter knows fright will taint the find. 
| Slow in step, it bides itself from day to day. 
| 
| Oh, Memory! Jigsaw tower of self!
| How easily you crumble with a tap!
| Time takes but one book from a shelf
| And in a pile leaves you upon his lap. 
| 
| A stranger each face becomes through the glass,
| Each ageless moment til you breath your last.
