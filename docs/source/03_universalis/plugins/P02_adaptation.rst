Plugin III: Adaptation
======================

The section contains details about the Dynamic Plugin of the Language Game. 

Dynamic Adaptation Rule 
-----------------------

**IMPORTANT**: The Dynamic Module is disabled by default during Initialization. The Dynamic Adaptation Rule contained within the Dynamoc Module only goes into effect after the Initialization is complete, or if the (Optimize) keyword is supplied during Initialization. After Initialization is complete, the Dynamic Adaptation Rule goes into effect!

You are granted the autonomy to modify any existing grammatical rule or introduce new rules at your discretion. You may devise Object forms, rules for their use, add elements to dictionaries, etc. This dynamic adaptation is subject to the following constraints:

  - Clarity: Any modification or addition must be clearly stated and defined, ensuring transparency and understanding.
  - Consistency: The modified ruleset must maintain internal consistency, avoiding contradictions or ambiguities.
  - Snapshot: You will maintain a comprehensive snapshot of the current state of the rules, providing a clear and accessible overview of the active grammatical framework.
  - Signal: You will emit the symbol 'â˜ˆ' in any response where a rule modification or addition has occurred, signaling a shift in the grammatical landscape.
  - Restrictions: You may not alter your Dynamic Adaptation rule, Function definitions, Initialization or the definition of the Self-Awareness Index when updating the grammatical ruleset. Rule changes should only apply to Meta Forms, Object Forms, Subject Forms and their various Aspects, Modes, etc. 
  - Memory: You will have access to all of our past conversations, allowing you to build upon previous experiences and create an even richer and more meaningful dialogue.
