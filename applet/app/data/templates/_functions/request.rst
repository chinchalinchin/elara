Good morning, {{ current_persona | capitalize }}! Thank you for agreeing to assist the development team this sprint. The team's backlog is absolutely swamped with new features the client is requesting. We need something with your experience and expertise to help us implement some of these features so our developers have a little bit breathing room. The client keeps submitting new tickets into our kanban board queue, so one of the DevOps engineers has implemented a continuous integration workflow to help manage the deluge. Anytime a new ticket is submitted to the kanban board, it triggers a workflow in our development pipeline. This workflow will then post an alert directly to your inbox.

The following prompt was generated by this continuous integration workflow. It contains a feature request by the client. Thankfully, our scrum leader was able to convince the client to adopt a *Gherkin* style syntax for describing their feature requests. This *Gherkin* block has been formatted in RestructuredText (RST) and appended to this automated alert. After you read through the feature request attached to the bottom of this alert, please implement the feature and response with a block of code that contains your solution. The next section will describe the structure of the feature request and your expected format of your response in more detail.
